Taking me by the arm, He saves me and carries me across the terrifying world-ocean. ||2||
God has rid me of my filth, and made me stainless and pure.
I have sought the Sanctuary of the Perfect Guru. ||3||
He Himself does, and causes everything to be done.
By His Grace, O Nanak, He saves us. ||4||4||17||
Basant, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Behold the flowers flowering, and the blossoms blossoming forth!
Renounce and abandon your egotism.
Grasp hold of His Lotus Feet.
Meet with God, O blessed one.
O my mind, remain conscious of the Lord. ||Pause||
The tender young plants smell so good,
while others remain like dry wood.
The season of spring has come;
it blossoms forth luxuriantly. ||1||
Now, the Dark Age of Kali Yuga has come.
Plant the Naam, the Name of the One Lord.
It is not the season to plant other seeds.
Do not wander lost in doubt and delusion.
He shall meet with the Guru and find the Lord,
who has such destiny written on his forehead.
O mortal, this is the season of the Naam.
Nanak utters the Glorious Praises of the Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har. ||2||18||
Basant, Fifth Mehl, Second House, Hindol:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Come and join together, O my Siblings of Destiny; dispel your sense of duality and let yourselves be lovingly absorbed in the Lord.
Let yourselves be joined to the Name of the Lord; become Gurmukh, spread out your mat, and sit down. ||1||
In this way, throw the dice, O brothers.
As Gurmukh, chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, day and night. At the very last moment, you shall not have to suffer in pain. ||1||Pause||
Let righteous actions be your game board, and let the truth be your dice.
Conquer sexual desire, anger, greed and worldly attachment; only such a game as this is dear to the Lord. ||2||
Rise in the early hours of the morning, and take your cleansing bath. Before you go to bed at night, remember to worship the Lord.
My True Guru will assist you, even on your most difficult moves; you shall reach your true home in celestial peace and poise. ||3||
The Lord Himself plays, and He Himself watches; the Lord Himself created the creation.
O servant Nanak, that person who plays this game as Gurmukh, wins the game of life, and returns to his true home. ||4||1||19||
Basant, Fifth Mehl, Hindol:
You alone know Your Creative Power, O Lord; no one else knows it.
He alone realizes You, O my Beloved, unto whom You show Your Mercy. ||1||
I am a sacrifice to Your devotees.
Your place is eternally beautiful, God; Your wonders are infinite. ||1||Pause||
Only You Yourself can perform Your service. No one else can do it.
He alone is Your devotee, who is pleasing to You. You bless them with Your Love. ||2||
