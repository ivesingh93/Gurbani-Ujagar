Gauree, First Mehl:
Past actions cannot be erased.
What do we know of what will happen hereafter?
Whatever pleases Him shall come to pass.
There is no other Doer except Him. ||1||
I do not know about karma, or how great Your gifts are.
The karma of actions, the Dharma of righteousness, social class and status, are contained within Your Name. ||1||Pause||
You are So Great, O Giver, O Great Giver!
The treasure of Your devotional worship is never exhausted.
One who takes pride in himself shall never be right.
The soul and body are all at Your disposal. ||2||
You kill and rejuvenate. You forgive and merge us into Yourself.
As it pleases You, You inspire us to chant Your Name.
You are All-knowing, All-seeing and True, O my Supreme Lord.
Please, bless me with the Guru's Teachings; my faith is in You alone. ||3||
One whose mind is attuned to the Lord, has no pollution in his body.
Through the Guru's Word, the True Shabad is realized.
All Power is Yours, through the greatness of Your Name.
Nanak abides in the Sanctuary of Your devotees. ||4||10||
Gauree, First Mehl:
Those who speak the Unspoken, drink in the Nectar.
Other fears are forgotten, and they are absorbed into the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||
Why should we fear, when fear is dispelled by the Fear of God?
Through the Shabad, the Word of the Perfect Guru, I recognize God. ||1||Pause||
Those whose hearts are filled with the Lord's essence,
are blessed and acclaimed, and intuitively absorbed into the Lord. ||2||
Those whom the Lord puts to sleep, evening and morning -
those self-willed manmukhs are bound and gagged by Death, here and hereafter. ||3||
Those whose hearts are filled with the Lord, day and night, are perfect.
O Nanak, they merge into the Lord, and their doubts are cast away. ||4||11||
Gauree, First Mehl:
One who loves the three qualities is subject to birth and death.
The four Vedas speak only of the visible forms.
They describe and explain the three states of mind,
but the fourth state, union with the Lord, is known only through the True Guru. ||1||
Through devotional worship of the Lord, and service to the Guru, one swims across.
Then, one is not born again, and is not subject to death. ||1||Pause||
Everyone speaks of the four great blessings;
the Simritees, the Shaastras and the Pandits speak of them as well.
But without the Guru, they do not understand their true significance.
The treasure of liberation is obtained through devotional worship of the Lord. ||2||
Those, within whose hearts the Lord dwells,
become Gurmukh; they receive the blessings of devotional worship.
Through devotional worship of the Lord, liberation and bliss are obtained.
Through the Guru's Teachings, supreme ecstasy is obtained. ||3||
One who meets the Guru, beholds Him, and inspires others to behold Him as well.
In the midst of hope, the Guru teaches us to live above hope and desire.
He is the Master of the meek, the Giver of peace to all.
Nanak's mind is imbued with the Lotus Feet of the Lord. ||4||12||
Gauree Chaytee, First Mehl:
With your nectar-like body, you live in comfort, but this world is just a passing drama.
You practice greed, avarice and great falsehood, and you carry such a heavy burden.
O body, I have seen you blowing away like dust on the earth. ||1||
Listen - listen to my advice!
Only the good deeds which you have done shall remain with you, O my soul. This opportunity shall not come again! ||1||Pause||
