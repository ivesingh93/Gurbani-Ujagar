Their sin and corruption are like rusty slag; they carry such a heavy load.
The path is treacherous and terrifying; how can they cross over to the other side?
O Nanak, those whom the Guru protects are saved. They are saved in the Name of the Lord. ||27||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Without serving the True Guru, no one finds peace; mortals dIE and are reborn, over and over again.
They have been given the drug of emotional attachment; in love with duality, they are totally corrupt.
Some are saved, by Guru's Grace. Everyone humbly bows before such humble beings.
O Nanak, meditate on the Naam, deep within yourself, day and night. You shall find the Door of Salvation. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Emotionally attached to Maya, the mortal forgets truth, death and the Name of the Lord.
Engaged in worldly affairs, his life wastes away; deep within himself, he suffers in pain.
O Nanak, those who have the karma of such pre-ordained destiny, serve the True Guru and find peace. ||2||
Pauree:
Read the account of the Name of the Lord, and you shall never again be called to account.
No one will question you, and you will always be safe in the Court of the Lord.
The Messenger of Death will meet you, and be your constant servant.
Through the Perfect Guru, you shall find the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. You shall be famous throughout the world.
O Nanak, the unstruck celestial melody vibrates at your door; come and merge with the Lord. ||28||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Whoever follows the Guru's Teachings, attains the most sublime peace of all peace.
Acting in accordance with the Guru, his fear is cut away; O Nanak, he is carried across. ||1||
Third Mehl:
The True Lord does not grow old; His Naam is never dirtied.
Whoever walks in harmony with the Guru's Will, shall not be reborn again.
O Nanak, those who forget the Naam, come and go in reincarnation. ||2||
Pauree:
I am a beggar; I ask this blessing of You: O Lord, please embellish me with Your Love.
I am so thirsty for the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan; His Darshan brings me satisfaction.
I cannot live for a moment, for even an instant, without seeing Him, O my mother.
The Guru has shown me that the Lord is always with me; He is permeating and pervading all places.
He Himself wakes the sleepers, O Nanak, and lovingly attunes them to Himself. ||29||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
The self-willed manmukhs do not even know how to speak. They are filled with sexual desire, anger and egotism.
They do not know the difference between good and bad; they constantly think of corruption.
In the Lord's Court, they are called to account, and they are judged to be false.
He Himself creates the Universe. He Himself contemplates it.
O Nanak, whom should we tell? The True Lord is permeating and pervading all. ||1||
Third Mehl:
The Gurmukhs worship and adore the Lord; they receive the good karma of their actions.
O Nanak, I am a sacrifice to those whose minds are filled with the Lord. ||2||
Pauree:
All people cherish hope, that they will live long lives.
They wish to live forever; they adorn and embellish their forts and mansions.
By various frauds and deceptions, they steal the wealth of others.
But the Messenger of Death keeps his gaze on their breath, and the life of those goblins decreases day by day.
