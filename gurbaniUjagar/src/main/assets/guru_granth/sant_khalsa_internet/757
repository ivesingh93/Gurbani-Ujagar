I am a sacrifice to those who chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord in their minds forever. ||1||Pause||
The Guru is like the Mansarovar Lake; only the very fortunate beings find Him.
The Gurmukhs, the selfless servants, seek out the Guru; the swan-souls feed there on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||
The Gurmukhs meditate on the Naam, and remain linked to the Naam.
Whatever is pre-ordained, accept it as the Will of the Guru. ||3||
By great good fortune, I searched my home, and found the treasure of the Naam.
The Perfect Guru has shown God to me; I have realized the Lord, the Supreme Soul. ||4||
There is One God of all; there is no other at all.
By Guru's Grace, the Lord comes to abide in the mind; in the heart of such a one, He is revealed. ||5||
God is the Inner-knower of all hearts; God dwells in every place.
So who should we call evil? Behold the Word of the Shabad, and lovingly dwell upon it. ||6||
He calls others bad and good, as long as he is in duality.
The Gurmukh understands the One and Only Lord; He is absorbed in the One Lord. ||7||
That is selfless service, which pleases God, and which is approved by God.
Servant Nanak worships the Lord in adoration; he focuses his consciousness on the Guru's Feet. ||8||2||4||9||
Raag Soohee, Ashtapadees, Fourth Mehl, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
If only someone would come, and lead me to meet my Darling Beloved; I would sell myself to him. ||1||
I long for the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan.
When the Lord shows Mercy unto me, then I meet the True Guru; I meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||Pause||
If You will bless me with happiness, then I will worship and adore You. Even in pain, I will meditate on You. ||2||
Even if You give me hunger, I will still feel satisfied; I am joyful, even in the midst of sorrow. ||3||
I would cut my mind and body apart into pieces, and offer them all to You; I would burn myself in fire. ||4||
I wave the fan over You, and carry water for You; whatever You give me, I take. ||5||
Poor Nanak has fallen at the Lord's Door; please, O Lord, unite me with Yourself, by Your Glorious Greatness. ||6||
Taking out my eyes, I place them at Your Feet; after travelling over the entire earth, I have come to understand this. ||7||
If You seat me near You, then I worship and adore You. Even if You beat me and drive me out, I will still meditate on You. ||8||
If people praise me, the praise is Yours. Even if they slander me, I will not leave You. ||9||
If You are on my side, then anyone can say anything. But if I were to forget You, then I would die. ||10||
I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to my Guru; falling at His Feet, I surrender to the Saintly Guru. ||11||
Poor Nanak has gone insane, longing for the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan. ||12||
Even in violent storms and torrential rain, I go out to catch a glimpse of my Guru. ||13||
Even though the oceans and the salty seas are very vast, the GurSikh will cross over it to get to his Guru. ||14||
Just as the mortal dies without water, so does the Sikh dIE without the Guru. ||15||
