O God, ocean of mercy, shower Your mercy on me, that I may yearn for loving devotional worship of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
The chakvi duck does not desire many comforts, but it is filled with bliss upon seeing the dawn.
The fish cannot survive any other way - without water, it dies. ||1||
I am a helpless orphan - I seek Your Sanctuary, O My Lord and Master; please bless me with Your mercy.
Nanak worships and adores the Lord's lotus feet; without Him, there is no other at all. ||2||6||10||
Jaitsree, Fifth Mehl:
The Lord, my very breath of life, abides in my mind and body.
Bless me with Your mercy, and unite me with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O perfect, all-knowing Lord God. ||1||Pause||
Those, unto whom You give the intoxicating herb of Your Love, drink in the supreme sublime essence.
I cannot describe their value; what power do I have? ||1||
The Lord attaches His humble servants to the hem of His robe, and they swim across the world-ocean.
Meditating, meditating, meditating in remembrance on God, peace is obtained; Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of Your Door. ||2||7||11||
Jaitsree, Fifth Mehl:
After wandering through so many incarnations, I have come to Your Sanctuary.
Save me - lift my body up out of the deep, dark pit of the world, and attach me to Your feet. ||1||Pause||
I do not know anything about spiritual wisdom, meditation or karma, and my way of life is not clean and pure.
Please attach me to the hem of the robe of the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; help me to cross over the terrible river. ||1||
Comforts, riches and the sweet pleasures of Maya - do not implant these within your mind.
Slave Nanak is satisfied and satiated by the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan; his only ornamentation is the love of the Lord's Name. ||2||8||12||
Jaitsree, Fifth Mehl:
O humble servants of the Lord, remember the Lord in meditation within your heart.
Misfortune does not even approach the Lord's humble servant; the works of His slave are perfectly fulfilled. ||1||Pause||
Millions of obstacles are removed, by serving the Lord, and one enters into the eternal dwelling of the Lord of the Universe.
The Lord's devotee is very fortunate; he has absolutely no fear. Even the Messenger of Death pays homage to him. ||1||
Forsaking the Lord of the world, he does other deeds, but these are temporary and transitory.
Grasp the Lord's lotus feet, and hold them in your heart, O Nanak; you shall obtain absolute peace and bliss. ||2||9||13||
Jaitsree, Ninth Mehl: One Universal Creator God.
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
My mind is deluded, entangled in Maya.
Whatever I do, while engaged in greed, only serves to bind me down. ||1||Pause||
I have no understanding at all; I am engrossed in the pleasures of corruption, and I have forgotten the Praises of the Lord.
The Lord and Master is with me, but I do not know Him. Instead, I run into the forest, looking for Him. ||1||
