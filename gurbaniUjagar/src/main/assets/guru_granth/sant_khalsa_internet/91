The Lord bestows bliss upon His devotees, and gives them a seat in the eternal home.
He does not give the sinners any stability or place of rest; He consigns them to the depths of hell.
The Lord blesses His devotees with His Love; He sides with them and saves them. ||19||
Shalok, First Mehl:
False-mindedness is the drummer-woman; cruelty is the butcheress; slander of others in one's heart is the cleaning-woman, and deceitful anger is the outcast-woman.
What good are the ceremonial lines drawn around your kitchen, when these four are seated there with you?
Make Truth your self-discipline, and make good deeds the lines you draw; make chanting the Name your cleansing bath.
O Nanak, those who do not walk in the ways of sin, shall be exalted in the world hereafter. ||1||
First Mehl:
Which is the swan, and which is the crane? It is only by His Glance of Grace.
Whoever is pleasing to Him, O Nanak, is transformed from a crow into a swan. ||2||
Pauree:
Whatever work you wish to accomplish-tell it to the Lord.
He will resolve your affairs; the True Guru gives His Guarantee of Truth.
In the Society of the Saints, you shall taste the treasure of the Ambrosial Nectar.
The Lord is the Merciful Destroyer of fear; He preserves and protects His slaves.
O Nanak, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and see the Unseen Lord God. ||20||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Body and soul, all belong to Him. He gives His Support to all.
O Nanak, become Gurmukh and serve Him, who is forever and ever the Giver.
I am a sacrifice to those who meditate on the Formless Lord.
Their faces are forever radiant, and the whole world bows in reverence to them. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Meeting the True Guru, I am totally transformed; I have obtained the nine treasures to use and consume.
The Siddhis-the eighteen supernatural spiritual powers-follow in my footsteps; I dwell in my own home, within my own self.
The Unstruck Melody constantly vibrates within; my mind is exalted and uplifted-I am lovingly absorbed in the Lord.
O Nanak, devotion to the Lord abides within the minds of those who have such pre-ordained destiny written on their foreheads. ||2||
Pauree:
I am a minstrel of the Lord God, my Lord and Master; I have come to the Lord's Door.
The Lord has heard my sad cries from within; He has called me, His minstrel, into His Presence.
The Lord called His minstrel in, and asked, "Why have you come here?
O Merciful God, please grant me the gift of continual meditation on the Lord's Name.
And so the Lord, the Great Giver, inspired Nanak to chant the Lord's Name, and blessed him with robes of honor. ||21||1||Sudh||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Siree Raag, Kabeer Jee: To Be Sung To The Tune Of "Ayk Su-Aan".
The mother thinks that her son is growing up; she does not understand that, day by day, his life is diminishing.
Calling him, "Mine, mine", she fondles him lovingly, while the Messenger of Death looks on and laughs. ||1||
