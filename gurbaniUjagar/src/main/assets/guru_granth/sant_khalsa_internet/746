Raag Soohee, Fifth Mehl, Fifth House, Partaal:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Love of the enticing Beloved Lord is the most glorious love.
Meditate, O mind, on the One Lord of the Universe - nothing else is of any account. Attach your mind to the Saints, and abandon the path of duality. ||1||Pause||
The Lord is absolute and unmanifest; He has assumed the most sublime manifestation. He has fashioned countless body chambers of many, varied, different, myriad forms.
Within them, the mind is the policeman;
my Beloved lives in the temple of my inner self.
He plays there in ecstasy.
He does not die, and he never grows old. ||1||
He is engrossed in worldly activities, wandering around in various ways. He steals the property of others,
and is surrounded by corruption and sin.
But now, he joins the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy,
and stands before the Lord's Gate.
He obtains the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan.
Nanak has met the Guru;
he shall not be reincarnated again. ||2||1||44||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
The Lord has made this world a stage;
He fashioned the expanse of the entire creation. ||1||Pause||
He fashioned it in various ways, with limitless colors and forms.
He watches over it with joy, and He never tires of enjoying it.
He enjoys all the delights, and yet He remains unattached. ||1||
He has no color, no sign, no mouth and no beard.
I cannot describe Your play.
Nanak is the dust of the feet of the Saints. ||2||2||45||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
I have come to You. I have come to Your Sanctuary.
I have come to place my faith in You. I have come seeking Mercy.
If it pleases You, save me, O my Lord and Master. The Guru has placed me upon the Path. ||1||Pause||
Maya is very treacherous and difficult to pass through;
it is like a violent wind-storm. ||1||
I am so afraid to hear
that the Righteous Judge of Dharma is so strict and stern. ||2||
The world is a deep, dark pit;
it is all on fire. ||3||
I have grasped the Support of the Holy Saints.
Nanak meditates on the Lord.
Now, I have found the Perfect Lord. ||4||3||46||
Raag Soohee, Fifth Mehl, Sixth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
I offer this prayer to the True Guru, to bless me with the sustenance of the Naam.
When the True King is pleased, the world is rid of its diseases. ||1||
You are the Support of Your devotees, and the Shelter of the Saints, O True Creator Lord. ||1||Pause||
True are Your devices, and True is Your Court.
True are Your treasures, and True is Your expanse. ||2||
Your Form is inaccessible, and Your Vision is incomparably beautiful.
I am a sacrifice to Your servants; they love Your Name, O Lord. ||3||
