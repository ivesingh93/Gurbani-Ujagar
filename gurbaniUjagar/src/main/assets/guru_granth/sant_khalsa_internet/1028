all diseases are eradicated, and one is blessed with the Ambrosial Nectar.
Death, the tax collector, does not impose any tax on one whose inner fire has been put out, whose heart is cool and tranquil. ||5||
The body has developed a great love for the soul-swan.
He is a Yogi, and she is a beautiful woman.
Day and night, he enjoys her with delight, and then he arises and departs without consulting her. ||6||
Creating the Universe, God remains diffused throughout it.
In the wind, water and fire, He vibrates and resounds.
The mind wavers, keeping company with evil passions; one obtains the rewards of his own actions. ||7||
Forgetting the Naam, one suffers the misery of his evil ways.
When the order to depart is issued, how can he remain here?
He falls into the pit of hell, and suffers like a fish out of water. ||8||
The faithless cynic has to endure 8.4 million hellish incarnations.
As he acts, so does he suffer.
Without the True Guru, there is no liberation. Bound and gagged by his own actions, he is helpless. ||9||
This path is very narrow, like the sharp edge of a sword.
When his account is read, he shall be crushed like the sesame seed in the mill.
Mother, father, spouse and child - none is anyone's friend in the end. Without the Lord's Love, no one is liberated. ||10||
You may have many friends and companions in the world,
but without the Guru, the Transcendent Lord Incarnate, there is no one at all.
Service to the Guru is the way to liberation. Night and day, sing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises. ||11||
Abandon falsehood, and pursue the Truth,
and you shall obtain the fruits of your desires.
Very few are those who trade in the merchandise of Truth. Those who deal in it, obtain the true profit. ||12||
Depart with the merchandise of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har,
and you shall intuitively obtain the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, in the Mansion of His Presence.
The Gurmukhs search for Him and find Him; they are the perfect humble beings. In this way, they see Him, who looks upon all alike. ||13||
God is endless; following the Guru's Teachings, some find Him.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they instruct their minds.
Accept as True, Perfectly True, the Word of the True Guru's Bani. In this way, you shall merge in the Lord, the Supreme Soul. ||14||
Naarad and Saraswati are Your servants.
Your servants are the greatest of the great, throughout the three worlds.
Your creative power permeates all; You are the Great Giver of all. You created the whole creation. ||15||
Some serve at Your Door, and their sufferings are dispelled.
They are robed with honor in the Court of the Lord, and emancipated by the True Guru.
The True Guru breaks the bonds of egotism, and restrains the fickle consciousness. ||16||
Meet the True Guru, and search for the way,
by which you may find God, and not have to answer for your account.
Subdue your egotism, and serve the Guru; O servant Nanak, you shall be drenched with the Lord's Love. ||17||2||8||
Maaroo, First Mehl:
My Lord is the Destroyer of demons.
My Beloved Lord is pervading each and every heart.
The unseen Lord is always with us, but He is not seen at all. The Gurmukh contemplates the record. ||1||
The Holy Gurmukh seeks Your Sanctuary.
