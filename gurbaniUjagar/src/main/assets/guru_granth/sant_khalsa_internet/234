Those who are attuned to the Shabad are immaculate and pure. They walk in harmony with the Will of the True Guru. ||7||
O Lord God, You are the One and Only Giver; You forgive us, and unite us with Yourself.
Servant Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary; if it is Your Will, please save him! ||8||1||9||
Raag Gauree Poorbee, Fourth Mehl, Karhalay:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O my wandering mind, you are like a camel - how will you meet the Lord, your Mother?
When I found the Guru, by the destiny of perfect good fortune, my Beloved came and embraced me. ||1||
O camel-like mind, meditate on the True Guru, the Primal Being. ||1||Pause||
O camel-like mind, contemplate the Lord, and meditate on the Lord's Name.
When you are called to answer for your account, the Lord Himself shall release you. ||2||
O camel-like mind, you were once very pure; the filth of egotism has now attached itself to you.
Your Beloved Husband is now manifest before you in your own home, but you are separated from Him, and you suffer such pain! ||3||
O my beloved camel-like mind, search for the Lord within your own heart.
He cannot be found by any device; the Guru will show you the Lord within your heart. ||4||
O my beloved camel-like mind, day and night, lovingly attune yourself to the Lord.
Return to your own home, and find the palace of love; meet the Guru, and meet the Lord. ||5||
O camel-like mind, you are my friend; abandon hypocrisy and greed.
The hypocritical and the greedy are struck down; the Messenger of Death punishes them with his club. ||6||
O camel-like mind, you are my breath of life; rid yourself of the pollution of hypocrisy and doubt.
The Perfect Guru is the Ambrosial Pool of the Lord's Nectar; join the Holy Congregation, and wash away this pollution. ||7||
O my dear beloved camel-like mind, listen only to the Teachings of the Guru.
This emotional attachment to Maya is so pervasive. Ultimately, nothing shall go along with anyone. ||8||
O camel-like mind, my good friend, take the supplies of the Lord's Name, and obtain honor.
In the Court of the Lord, you shall be robed with honor, and the Lord Himself shall embrace you. ||9||
O camel-like mind, one who surrenders to the Guru becomes Gurmukh, and works for the Lord.
Offer your prayers to the Guru; O servant Nanak, He shall unite you with the Lord. ||10||1||
Gauree, Fourth Mehl:
O contemplative camel-like mind, contemplate and look carefully.
The forest-dwellers have grown weary of wandering in the forests; following the Guru's Teachings, see your Husband Lord within your heart. ||1||
O camel-like mind, dwell upon the Guru and the Lord of the Universe. ||1||Pause||
O camel-like contemplative mind, the self-willed manmukhs are caught in the great net.
The mortal who becomes Gurmukh is liberated, dwelling upon the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||2||
O my dear beloved camel-like mind, seek the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, and the True Guru.
Joining the Sat Sangat, meditate on the Lord, and the Lord, Har, Har, shall go along with you. ||3||
O very fortunate camel-like mind, with one Glance of Grace from the Lord, you shall be enraptured.
