My eyes are drenched with the Love of my Husband Lord, O my dear beloved, like the song-bird with the rain drop.
My mind is cooled and soothed, O my dear beloved, by drinking in the rain drops of the Lord.
Separation from my Lord keeps my body awake, O my dear beloved; I cannot sleep at all.
Nanak has found the Lord, the True Friend, O my dear beloved, by loving the Guru. ||3||
In the month of Chayt, O my dear beloved, the pleasant season of spring begins.
But without my Husband Lord, O my dear beloved, my courtyard is filled with dust.
But my sad mind is still hopeful, O my dear beloved; my eyes are both fixed upon Him.
Beholding the Guru, Nanak is filled with wondrous joy, like a child, gazing upon his mother. ||4||
The True Guru has preached the sermon of the Lord, O my dear beloved.
I am a sacrifice to the Guru, O my dear beloved, who has united me with the Lord.
The Lord has fulfilled all my hopes, O my dear beloved; I have obtained the fruits of my heart's desires.
When the Lord is pleased, O my dear beloved, servant Nanak is absorbed into the Naam. ||5||
Without the Beloved Lord, there is no play of love.
How can I find the Guru? Grasping hold of Him, I behold my Beloved.
O Lord, O Great Giver, let me meet the Guru; as Gurmukh, may I merge with You.
Nanak has found the Guru, O my dear beloved; such was the destiny inscribed upon his forehead. ||6||14||21||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Raag Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Chhant, First House:
Joy - great joy! I have seen the Lord God!
Tasted - I have tasted the sweet essence of the Lord.
The sweet essence of the Lord has rained down in my mind; by the pleasure of the True Guru, I have attained peaceful ease.
I have come to dwell in the home of my own self, and I sing the songs of joy; the five villains have fled.
I am soothed and satisfied with the Ambrosial Bani of His Word; the friendly Saint is my advocate.
Says Nanak, my mind is in harmony with the Lord; I have seen God with my eyes. ||1||
Adorned - adorned are my beauteous gates, O Lord.
Guests - my guests are the Beloved Saints, O Lord.
The Beloved Saints have resolved my affairs; I humbly bowed to them, and committed myself to their service.
He Himself is the groom's party, and He Himself the bride's party; He Himself is the Lord and Master; He Himself is the Divine Lord.
He Himself resolves His own affairs; He Himself sustains the Universe.
Says Nanak, my Bridegroom is sitting in my home; the gates of my body are beautifully adorned. ||2||
The nine treasures - the nine treasures come into my home, Lord.
Everything - I obtain everything, meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Meditating on the Naam, the Lord of the Universe becomes the one's eternal companion, and he dwells in peaceful ease.
His calculations are ended, his wanderings cease, and his mind is no longer afflicted with anxiety.
When the Lord of the Universe reveals Himself, and the unstruck melody of the sound current vibrates, the drama of wondrous splendor is enacted.
Says Nanak, when my Husband Lord is with me, I obtain the nine treasures. ||3||
Overjoyed - overjoyed are all my brothers and friends.
