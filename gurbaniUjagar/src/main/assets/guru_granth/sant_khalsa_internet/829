Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Never forget Your servant, O Lord.
Hug me close in Your embrace, O God, my Lord and Master; consider my primal love for You, O Lord of the Universe. ||1||Pause||
It is Your Natural Way, God, to purify sinners; please do not keep my errors in Your Heart.
You are my life, my breath of life, O Lord, my wealth and peace; be merciful to me, and burn away the curtain of egotism. ||1||
Without water, how can the fish survive? Without milk, how can the baby survive?
Servant Nanak thirsts for the Lord's Lotus Feet; gazing upon the Blessed Vision of his Lord and Master's Darshan, he finds the essence of peace. ||2||7||123||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Here, and hereafter, there is happiness.
The Perfect Guru has perfectly, totally saved me; the Supreme Lord God has been kind to me. ||1||Pause||
The Lord, my Beloved, is pervading and permeating my mind and body; all my pains and sufferings are dispelled.
In celestial peace, tranquility and bliss, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord; my enemies and adversaries have been totally destroyed. ||1||
God has not considered my merits and demerits; in His Mercy, He has made me His own.
Unweighable is the greatness of the immovable and imperishable Lord; Nanak proclaims the victory of the Lord. ||2||8||124||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Without the Fear of God, and devotional worship, how can anyone cross over the world-ocean?
Be kind to me, O Saving Grace of sinners; preserve my faith in You, O my Lord and Master. ||1||Pause||
The mortal does not remember the Lord in meditation; he wanders around intoxicated by egotism; he is engrossed in corruption like a dog.
Utterly cheated, his life is slipping away; committing sins, he is sinking away. ||1||
I have come to Your Sanctuary, Destroyer of pain; O Primal Immaculate Lord, may I dwell upon You in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
O Lord of beautiful hair, Destroyer of pain, Eradicator of sins, Nanak lives, gazing upon the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. ||2||9||125||
Raag Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl, Du-Padas, Ninth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
He Himself merges us with Himself.
When I came to Your Sanctuary, my sins vanished. ||1||Pause||
Renouncing egotistical pride and other anxieties, I have sought the Sanctuary of the Holy Saints.
Chanting, meditating on Your Name, O my Beloved, disease is eradicated from my body. ||1||
Even utterly foolish, ignorant and thoughtless persons have been saved by the Kind Lord.
Says Nanak, I have met the Perfect Guru; my comings and goings have ended. ||2||1||126||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Hearing Your Name, I live.
When the Perfect Guru became pleased with me, then my hopes were fulfilled. ||1||Pause||
Pain is gone, and my mind is comforted; the music of bliss fascinates me.
The yearning to meet my Beloved God has welled up within me. I cannot live without Him, even for an instant. ||1||
