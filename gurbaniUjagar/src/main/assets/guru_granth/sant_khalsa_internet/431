Aasaavaree, Fifth Mehl, Third House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
My mind is in love with the Lord.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I meditate on the Lord, Har, Har; my lifestyle is pure and true. ||1||Pause||
I have such a great thirst for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan; I think of him in so many ways.
So be Merciful, O Supreme Lord; shower Your Mercy upon me, O Lord, Destroyer of pride. ||1||
My stranger soul has come to join the Saadh Sangat.
That commodity, which I longed for, I have found in the Love of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||
There are so many pleasures and delights of Maya, but they pass away in an instant.
Your devotees are imbued with Your Name; they enjoy peace everywhere. ||3||
The entire world is seen to be passing away; only the Lord's Name is lasting and stable.
So make friends with the Holy Saints, so that you may obtain a lasting place of rest. ||4||
Friends, acquaintances, children and relatives - none of these shall be your companion.
The Lord's Name alone shall go with you; God is the Master of the meek. ||5||
The Lord's Lotus Feet are the Boat; attached to Them, you shall cross over the world-ocean.
Meeting with the Perfect True Guru, I embrace True Love for God. ||6||
The prayer of Your Holy Saints is, "May I never forget You, for even one breath or morsel of food".
Whatever is pleasing to Your Will is good; by Your Sweet Will, my affairs are adjusted. ||7||
I have met my Beloved, the Ocean of Peace, and Supreme Bliss has welled up within me.
Says Nanak, all my pains have been eradicated, meeting with God, the Lord of Supreme Bliss. ||8||1||2||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Birharray ~ Songs Of Separation, To Be Sung In The Tune Of The Chhants. Fourth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Remember the Supreme Lord God, O Beloved, and make yourself a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. ||1||
Remembering Him, sorrows are forgotten, O Beloved; how can one forsake Him? ||2||
I would sell this body to the Saint, O Beloved, if he would lead me to my Dear Lord. ||3||
The pleasures and adornments of corruption are insipid and useless; I have forsaken and abandoned them, O my Mother. ||4||
Lust, anger and greed left me, O Beloved, when I fell at the Feet of the True Guru. ||5||
Those humble beings who are imbued with the Lord, O Beloved, do not go anywhere else. ||6||
Those who have tasted the Lord's sublime essence, O Beloved, remain satisfied and satiated. ||7||
One who grasps the Hem of the Gown of the Holy Saint, O Nanak, crosses over the terrible world-ocean. ||8||1||3||
The pains of birth and death are removed, O Beloved, when the mortal meets with the Lord, the King. ||1||
God is so Beautiful, so Refined, so Wise - He is my very life! Reveal to me Your Darshan! ||2||
Those beings who are separated from You, O Beloved, are born only to die; they eat the poison of corruption. ||3||
He alone meets You, whom You cause to meet, O Beloved; I fall at his feet. ||4||
That happiness which one receives by beholding Your Darshan, O Beloved, cannot be described in words. ||5||
True Love cannot be broken, O Beloved; throughout the ages, it remains. ||6||
