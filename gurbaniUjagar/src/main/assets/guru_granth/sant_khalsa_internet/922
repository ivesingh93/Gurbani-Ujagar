Says Nanak, God Himself has met me; He is the Doer, the Cause of causes. ||34||
O my body, why have you come into this world? What actions have you committed?
And what actions have you committed, O my body, since you came into this world?
The Lord who formed your form - you have not enshrined that Lord in your mind.
By Guru's Grace, the Lord abides within the mind, and one's pre-ordained destiny is fulfilled.
Says Nanak, this body is adorned and honored, when one's consciousness is focused on the True Guru. ||35||
O my eyes, the Lord has infused His Light into you; do not look upon any other than the Lord.
Do not look upon any other than the Lord; the Lord alone is worthy of beholding.
This whole world which you see is the image of the Lord; only the image of the Lord is seen.
By Guru's Grace, I understand, and I see only the One Lord; there is no one except the Lord.
Says Nanak, these eyes were blind; but meeting the True Guru, they became all-seeing. ||36||
O my ears, you were created only to hear the Truth.
To hear the Truth, you were created and attached to the body; listen to the True Bani.
Hearing it, the mind and body are rejuvenated, and the tongue is absorbed in Ambrosial Nectar.
The True Lord is unseen and wondrous; His state cannot be described.
Says Nanak, listen to the Ambrosial Naam and become holy; you were created only to hear the Truth. ||37||
The Lord placed the soul to the cave of the body, and blew the breath of life into the musical instrument of the body.
He blew the breath of life into the musical instrument of the body, and revealed the nine doors; but He kept the Tenth Door hidden.
Through the Gurdwara, the Guru's Gate, some are blessed with loving faith, and the Tenth Door is revealed to them.
There are many images of the Lord, and the nine treasures of the Naam; His limits cannot be found.
Says Nanak, the Lord placed the soul to the cave of the body, and blew the breath of life into the musical instrument of the body. ||38||
Sing this true song of praise in the true home of your soul.
Sing the song of praise in your true home; meditate there on the True Lord forever.
They alone meditate on You, O True Lord, who are pleasing to Your Will; as Gurmukh, they understand.
This Truth is the Lord and Master of all; whoever is blessed, obtains it.
Says Nanak, sing the true song of praise in the true home of your soul. ||39||
Listen to the song of bliss, O most fortunate ones; all your longings shall be fulfilled.
I have obtained the Supreme Lord God, and all sorrows have been forgotten.
Pain, illness and suffering have departed, listening to the True Bani.
The Saints and their friends are in ecstasy, knowing the Perfect Guru.
Pure are the listeners, and pure are the speakers; the True Guru is all-pervading and permeating.
Prays Nanak, touching the Guru's Feet, the unstruck sound current of the celestial bugles vibrates and resounds. ||40||1||
