The eyes which are attracted by the Lord's Love behold the Lord through the Name of the Lord.
If they gaze upon something else, O servant Nanak, they ought to be gouged out. ||2||
Pauree:
The Infinite Lord totally permeates the water, the land and the sky.
He cherishes and sustains all beings and creatures; whatever He does comes to pass.

Let all chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the World, who is manifest all over the world. ||13||

The desires of the mind are satisfied, meditating on the Ocean of Peace.
Worship and adore the Feet of the Lord, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the jewel mine.

The treasure of this human life is won, meditating on the Lord of Detachment.

Some sing, some listen, and some speak and preach.
The filth and pollution of countless lifetimes is washed away, and the wishes of the mind are fulfilled.
Coming and going in reincarnation ceases, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.

Servant Nanak is a sacrifice to those who are pleasing to my Lord God. ||15||1|| Sudh||
Raag Kaanraa, The Word Of Naam Dayv Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Such is the Sovereign Lord, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of Hearts;
He sees everything as clearly as one's face reflected in a mirror. ||1||Pause||
He dwells in each and every heart; no stain or stigma sticks to Him.
He is liberated from bondage; He does not belong to any social class. ||1||
As one's face is reflected in the water,
so does Naam Dayv's Beloved Lord and Master appear. ||2||1||
