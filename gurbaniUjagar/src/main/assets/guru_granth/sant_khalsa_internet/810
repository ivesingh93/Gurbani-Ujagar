Those who worked for half a shell, will be judged very wealthy. ||3||
What glorious greatness of Yours can I describe, O Lord of infinite excellences?
Please bless me with Your Mercy, and grant me Your Name; O Nanak, I am lost without the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. ||4||7||37||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
He is constantly entangled in pride, conflict, greed and tasty flavors.
He is involved in deception, fraud, household affairs and corruption. ||1||
I have seen this with my eyes, by the Grace of the Perfect Guru.
Power, property, wealth and youth are useless, without the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Beauty, incense, scented oils, beautiful clothes and foods -
when they come into contact with the body of the sinner, they stink. ||2||
Wandering, wandering around, the soul is reincarnated as a human, but this body lasts only for an instant.
Losing this opportunity, he must wander again through countless incarnations. ||3||
By God's Grace, he meets the Guru; contemplating the Lord, Har, Har, he is wonderstruck.
He is blessed with peace, poise and bliss, O Nanak, through the perfect sound current of the Naad. ||4||8||38||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
The feet of the Saints are the boat, to cross over the world-ocean.
In the wilderness, the Guru places them on the Path, and reveals the secrets of the Lord's Mystery. ||1||
O Lord, Har Har Har, Har Har Haray, Har Har Har, I love You.
While standing up, sitting down and sleeping, think of the Lord, Har Har Har. ||1||Pause||
The five thieves run away, when one joins the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
His investment is intact, and he earns great profits; his household is blessed with honor. ||2||
His position is unmoving and eternal, his anxiety is ended, and he wavers no more.
His doubts and misgivings are dispelled, and he sees God everywhere. ||3||
The Virtues of our Virtuous Lord and Master are so profound; how many of His Glorious Virtues should I speak?
Nanak has obtained the Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord, Har, Har, in the Company of the Holy. ||4||9||39||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
That life, which has no contact with the Holy, is useless.
Joining their congregation, all doubts are dispelled, and I am emancipated. ||1||
That day, when I meet with the Holy - I am a sacrifice to that day.
Again and again, I sacrifice my body, mind and soul to them. ||1||Pause||
They have helped me renounce this ego, and implant this humility within myself.
This mind has become the dust of all men's feet, and my self-conceit has been dispelled. ||2||
In an instant, I burnt away the ideas of slander and ill-will towards others.
I see close at hand, the Lord of mercy and compassion; He is not far away at all. ||3||
My body and mind are cooled and soothed, and now, I am liberated from the world.
Love, consciousness, the breath of life, wealth and everything, O Nanak, are in the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan. ||4||10||40||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
I perform service for Your slave, O Lord, and wipe his feet with my hair.
I offer my head to him, and listen to the Glorious Praises of the Lord, the source of bliss. ||1||
Meeting You, my mind is rejuvenated, so please meet me, O Merciful Lord.
Night and day, my mind enjoys bliss, contemplating the Lord of Compassion. ||1||Pause||
