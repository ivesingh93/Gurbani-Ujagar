BHABHA: When doubt is pierced, union is achieved.
I have shattered my fear, and now I have come to have faith.
I thought that He was outside of me, but now I know that He is within me.
When I came to understand this mystery, then I recognized the Lord. ||30||
MAMMA: Clinging to the source, the mind is satisfied.
One who knows this mystery understands his own mind.
Let no one delay in uniting his mind.
Those who obtain the True Lord are immersed in delight. ||31||
MAMMA: The mortal's business is with his own mind; one who disciplines his mind attains perfection.
Only the mind can deal with the mind; says Kabeer, I have not met anything like the mind. ||32||
This mind is Shakti; this mind is Shiva.
This mind is the life of the five elements.
When this mind is channeled, and guided to enlightenment,
it can describe the secrets of the three worlds. ||33||
YAYYA: If you know anything, then destroy your evil-mindedness, and subjugate the body-village.
When you are engaged in the battle, don't run away; then, you shall be known as a spiritual hero. ||34||
RARRA: I have found tastes to be tasteless.
Becoming tasteless, I have realized that taste.
Abandoning these tastes, I have found that taste.
Drinking in that taste, this taste is no longer pleasing. ||35||
LALLA: Embrace such love for the Lord in your mind,
that you shall not have to go to any other; you shall attain the supreme truth.
And if you embrace love and affection for Him there,
then you shall obtain the Lord; obtaining Him, you shall be absorbed in His Feet. ||36||
WAWA: Time and time again, dwell upon the Lord.
Dwelling upon the Lord, defeat shall not come to you.
I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to those, who sing the praises of the Saints, the sons of the Lord.
Meeting the Lord, total Truth is obtained. ||37||
WAWA: Know Him. By knowing Him, this mortal becomes Him.
When this soul and that Lord are blended, then, having been blended, they cannot be known separately. ||38||
SASSA: Discipline your mind with sublime perfection.
Refrain from that talk which attracts the heart.
The heart is attracted, when love wells up.
The King of the three worlds is perfectly pervading and permeating there. ||39||
KHAKHA: Anyone who seeks Him,
and by seeking Him, finds Him, shall not be born again.
When someone seeks Him, and comes to understand and contemplate Him,
then he crosses over the terrifying world-ocean in an instant. ||40||
SASSA: The bed of the soul-bride is adorned by her Husband Lord;
her skepticism is dispelled.
Renouncing the shallow pleasures of the world, she obtains the supreme delight.
Then, she is the soul-bride; He is called her Husband Lord. ||41||
HAHA: He exists, but He is not known to exist.
When He is known to exist, then the mind is pleased and appeased.
Of course the Lord exists, if one could only understand Him.
Then, He alone exists, and not this mortal being. ||42||
Everyone goes around saying, "I'll take this, and I'll take that".
Because of that, they suffer in terrible pain.
When someone comes to love the Lord of Lakhshmi,
his sorrow departs, and he obtains total peace. ||43||
KHAKHA: Many have wasted their lives, and then perished.
Wasting away, they do not remember the Lord, even now.
But if someone, even now, comes to know the transitory nature of the world and restrain his mind,
he shall find his permanent home, from which he was separated. ||44||
The fifty-two letters have been joined together.
