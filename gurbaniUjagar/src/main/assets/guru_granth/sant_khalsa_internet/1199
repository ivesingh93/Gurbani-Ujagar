Saarang, Fourth Mehl:
O my Beloved Lord, Har, Har, please bless me with Your Ambrosial Name.
Those whose minds are pleased to be Gurmukh - the Lord completes their projects. ||1||Pause||
Those humble beings who become meek before the Guru-their pains are taken away.
Night and day, they perform devotional worship services to the Guru; they are embellished with the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||1||
Within their hearts is the ambrosial essence of the Naam, the Name of the Lord; they savor this essence, sing the praises of this essence, and contemplate this essence.
By Guru's Grace, they are aware of this ambrosial essence; they find the Gate of Salvation. ||2||
The True is the Primal Being, Unmoving and Unchanging. One who takes the Support of the Naam, the Name of the Lord - his intellect becomes focused and steady.
I offer my soul to Him; I am a sacrifice to my True Guru. ||3||
The self-willed manmukhs are stuck in doubt and attached to duality; the darkness of spiritual ignorance is within them.
They do not see the True Guru, the Giver; they are not on this shore, or the other. ||4||
Our Lord and Master is permeating and pervading each and every heart; He is supremely Potent to exercise His Might.
Nanak, the slave of His slaves, says, please, be merciful and save me! ||5||3||
Saarang, Fourth Mehl:
This is the way to work for the Lord.
Whatever He does, accept that as true. As Gurmukh, remain lovingly absorbed in His Name. ||1||Pause||
The Love of the Lord of the Universe seems supremely sweet. Everything else is forgotten.
Night and day, he is in ecstasy; his mind is pleased and appeased, and his light merges into the Light. ||1||
Singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, his mind is satisfied. Peace and tranquility come to abide within his mind.
When the Guru becomes merciful, the mortal finds the Lord; he focuses his consciousness on the Lord's Lotus Feet. ||2||
The intellect is enlightened, meditating on the Lord. He remains lovingly attuned to the essence of spiritual wisdom.
The Divine Light radiates forth deep within his being; his mind is pleased and appeased. He merges intuitively into Celestial Samaadhi. ||3||
One whose heart is filled with falsehood, continues to practice falsehood, even while he teaches and preaches about the Lord.
Within him is the utter darkness of greed. He is thrashed like wheat, and suffers in pain. ||4||
When my God is totally pleased, the mortal tunes in and becomes Gurmukh.
Nanak has obtained the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord. Chanting the Naam, he has found peace. ||5||4||
Saarang, Fourth Mehl:
My mind is pleased and appeased by the Name of the Lord.
The True Guru has implanted divine love within my heart. The Sermon of the Lord, Har, Har, is pleasing to my mind. ||1||Pause||
Please be merciful to Your meek and humble servant; please bless Your humble servant with Your Unspoken Speech.
Meeting with the humble Saints, I have found the sublime essence of the Lord. The Lord seems so sweet to my mind and body. ||1||
They alone are unattached, who are imbued with the Lord's Love; through the Guru's Teachings, they realize the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Meeting with the Primal Being, one finds peace, and one's comings and goings in reincarnation are ended. ||2||
With my eyes, I gaze lovingly upon God, my Lord and Master. I chant His Name with my tongue.
