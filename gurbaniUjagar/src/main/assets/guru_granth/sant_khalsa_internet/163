God Himself bestows wisdom; meditate on the Name of the Lord.
By great good fortune, one meets the True Guru, who places the Ambrosial Nectar in the mouth.
When egotism and duality are eradicated, one intuitively merges in peace.
He Himself is All-pervading; He Himself links us to His Name. ||2||
The self-willed manmukhs, in their arrogant pride, do not find God; they are so ignorant and foolish!
They do not serve the True Guru, and in the end, they regret and repent, over and over again.
They are cast into the womb to be reincarnated, and within the womb, they rot.
As it pleases my Creator Lord, the self-willed manmukhs wander around lost. ||3||
My Lord God inscribed the full pre-ordained destiny upon the forehead.
When one meets the Great and Courageous Guru, one meditates on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
The Lord's Name is my mother and father; the Lord is my relative and brother.
O Lord, Har, Har, please forgive me and unite me with Yourself. Servant Nanak is a lowly worm. ||4||3||17||37||
Gauree Bairaagan, Third Mehl:
From the True Guru, I obtained spiritual wisdom; I contemplate the Lord's essence.
My polluted intellect was enlightened by chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
The distinction between Shiva and Shakti - mind and matter - has been destroyed, and the darkness has been dispelled.
The Lord's Name is loved by those, upon whose foreheads such pre-ordained destiny was written. ||1||
How can the Lord be obtained, O Saints? Seeing Him, my life is sustained.
Without the Lord, I cannot live, even for an instant. Unite me with the Guru, so that I may drink in the sublime essence of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and I listen to them daily; the Lord, Har, Har, has emancipated me.
I have obtained the Lord's essence from the Guru; my mind and body are drenched with it.
Blessed, blessed is the Guru, the True Being, who has blessed me with devotional worship of the Lord.
From the Guru, I have obtained the Lord; I have made Him my Guru. ||2||
The Sovereign Lord is the Giver of virtue. I am worthless and without virtue.
The sinners sink like stones; through the Guru's Teachings, the Lord carries us across.
You are the Giver of virtue, O Immaculate Lord; I am worthless and without virtue.
I have entered Your Sanctuary, Lord; please save me, as You have saved the idiots and fools. ||3||
Eternal celestial bliss comes through the Guru's Teachings, by meditating continually on the Lord, Har, Har.
I have obtained the Lord God as my Best Friend, within the home of my own self. I sing the Songs of Joy.
Please shower me with Your Mercy, O Lord God, that I may meditate on Your Name, Har, Har.
Servant Nanak begs for the dust of the feet of those who have found the True Guru. ||4||4||18||38||
Gauree Gwaarayree, Fourth Mehl, Chau-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The Pandit - the religious scholar - recites the Shaastras and the Simritees;
the Yogi cries out, "Gorakh, Gorakh".
But I am just a fool - I just chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||
I do not know what my condition shall be, Lord.
O my mind, vibrate and meditate on the Name of the Lord. You shall cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||Pause||
