Swaiyas From The Mouth Of The Great Fifth Mehl:
O Primal Lord God, You Yourself are the Creator, the Cause of all causes.
You are All-pervading everywhere, totally filling all hearts.
You are seen pervading the world; who can know Your State? You protect all; You are our Lord and Master.
O my Imperishable and Formless Lord, You formed Yourself.
You are the One and Only; no one else is like You.
O Lord, You have no end or limitation. Who can contemplate You? You are the Father of the world, the Support of all life.
Your devotees are at Your Door, O God - they are just like You. How can servant Nanak describe them with only one tongue?
I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, forever a sacrifice to them. ||1||
Streams of Ambrosial Nectar flow; Your Treasures are unweighable and overflowing in abundance. You are the Farthest of the far, Infinite and Incomparably Beautiful.
You do whatever You please; You do not take advice from anyone else. In Your Home, creation and destruction happen in an instant.
No one else is equal to You; Your Light is Immaculate and Pure. Millions of sins are washed away, chanting Your Name, Har, Har.
Your devotees are at Your Door, God - they are just like You. How can servant Nanak describe them with only one tongue?
I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, forever a sacrifice to them. ||2||
You established all the worlds from within Yourself, and extended them outward. You are All-pervading amongst all, and yet You Yourself remain detached.
O Lord, there is no end or limit to Your Glorious Virtues; all beings and creatures are Yours. You are the Giver of all, the One Invisible Lord.
