You are pervading and permeating all places and inter-spaces, O Creator. You made all that has been made.
You created the entire universe, with all its colors and shades; in so many ways and means and forms You formed it.
O Lord of Light, Your Light is infused within all; You link us to the Guru's Teachings.
They alone meet the True Guru, unto whom You are Merciful; O Lord, You instruct them in the Guru's Word.
Let everyone chant the Name of the Lord, chant the Name of the Great Lord; all poverty, pain and hunger shall be taken away. ||3||
Shalok, Fourth Mehl:
The Ambrosial Nectar of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is sweet; enshrine this Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord within your heart.
The Lord God prevails in the Sangat, the Holy Congregation; reflect upon the Shabad and understand.
Meditating on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, within the mind, the poison of egotism is eradicated.
One who does not remember the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, shall totally lose this life in the gamble.
By Guru's Grace, one remembers the Lord, and enshrines the Lord's Name within the heart.
O servant Nanak, his face shall be radiant in the Court of the True Lord. ||1||
Fourth Mehl:
To chant the Lord's Praise and His Name is sublime and exalted. This is the most excellent deed in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga.
His Praises come through the Guru's Teachings and Instructions; wear the Necklace of the Lord's Name.
Those who meditate on the Lord are very fortunate. They are entrusted with the Treasure of the Lord.
Without the Name, no matter what people may do, they continue to waste away in egotism.
Elephants can be washed and bathed in water, but they only throw dust on their heads again.
O Kind and Compassionate True Guru, please unite me with the Lord, that the One Creator of the Universe may abide within my mind.
Those Gurmukhs who listen to the Lord and believe in Him - servant Nanak salutes them. ||2||
Pauree:
The Lord's Name is the most sublime and precious merchandise. The Primal Lord God is my Lord and Master.
The Lord has staged His Play, and He Himself permeates it. The whole world deals in this merchandise.
Your Light is the light in all beings, O Creator. All Your Expanse is True.
All those who meditate on You become prosperous; through the Guru's Teachings, they sing Your Praises, O Formless Lord.
Let everyone chant the Lord, the Lord of the World, the Lord of the Universe, and cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||4||
Shalok, Fourth Mehl:
I have only one tongue, and the Glorious Virtues of the Lord God are Unapproachable and Unfathomable.
I am ignorant - how can I meditate on You, Lord? You are Great, Unapproachable and Immeasurable.
O Lord God, please bless me with that sublime wisdom, that I may fall at the Feet of the Guru, the True Guru.
O Lord God, please lead me to the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, where even a sinner like myself may be saved.
O Lord, please bless and forgive servant Nanak; please unite him in Your Union.
O Lord, please be merciful and hear my prayer; I am a sinner and a worm - please save me! ||1||
Fourth Mehl:
O Lord, Life of the World, please bless me with Your Grace, and lead me to meet the Guru, the Merciful True Guru.
I am happy to serve the Guru; the Lord has become merciful to me.
