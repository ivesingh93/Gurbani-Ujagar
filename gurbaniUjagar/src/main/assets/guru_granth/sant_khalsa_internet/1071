One who serves in egotism is not accepted or approved.
Such a person is born, only to die again, and come and go in reincarnation.
Perfect is that penance and that service, which is pleasing to the Mind of my Lord. ||11||
What Glorious Virtues of Yours should I chant, O my Lord and Master?
You are the Inner-knower, the Searcher of all souls.
I beg for blessings from You, O Creator Lord; I repeat Your Name night and day. ||12||
Some speak in egotistical power.
Some have the power of authority and Maya.
I have no other Support at all, except the Lord. O Creator Lord, please save me, meek and dishonored. ||13||
You bless the meek and dishonored with honor, as it pleases You, O Lord.
Many others argue in conflict, coming and going in reincarnation.
Those people, whose side You take, O Lord and Master, are elevated and successful. ||14||
Those who meditate forever on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har,
by Guru's Grace, obtain the supreme status.
Those who serve the Lord find peace; without serving Him, they regret and repent. ||15||
You are pervading all, O Lord of the world.
He alone meditates on the Lord, upon whose forehead the Guru places His hand.
Entering the Sanctuary of the Lord, I meditate on the Lord; servant Nanak is the slave of His slaves. ||16||2||
Maaroo, Solahas, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
He infused His power into the earth.
He suspends the heavens upon the feet of His Command.
He created fire and locked it into wood. That God protects all, O Siblings of Destiny. ||1||
He gives nourishment to all beings and creatures.
He Himself is the all-powerful Creator, the Cause of causes.
In an instant, He establishes and disestablishes; He is your help and support. ||2||
He cherished you in your mother's womb.
With every breath and morsel of food, He is with you, and takes care of you.
Forever and ever, meditate on that Beloved; Great is His glorious greatness! ||3||
The sultans and nobles are reduced to dust in an instant.
God cherishes the poor, and makes them into rulers.
He is the Destroyer of egotistical pride, the Support of all. His value cannot be estimated. ||4||
He alone is honorable, and he alone is wealthy,
within whose mind the Lord God abides.
He alone is my mother, father, child, relative and sibling, who created this Universe. ||5||
I have come to God's Sanctuary, and so I fear nothing.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I am sure to be saved.
One who adores the Creator in thought, word and deed, shall never be punished. ||6||
One whose mind and body are permeated with the Lord, the treasure of virtue,
does not wander in birth, death and reincarnation.
Pain vanishes and peace prevails, when one is satisfied and fulfilled. ||7||
My Lord and Master is my best friend.
