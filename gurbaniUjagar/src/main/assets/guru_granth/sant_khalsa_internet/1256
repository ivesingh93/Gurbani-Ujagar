He sees pleasure and pain as both the same, along with good and bad in the world.
Wisdom, understanding and awareness are found in the Name of the Lord. In the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, embrace love for the Guru. ||2||
Day and night, profit is obtained through the Lord's Name. The Guru, the Giver, has given this gift.
That Sikh who becomes Gurmukh obtains it. The Creator blesses him with His Glance of Grace. ||3||
The body is a mansion, a temple, the home of the Lord; He has infused His Infinite Light into it.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh is invited to the Mansion of the Lord's Presence; the Lord unites him in His Union. ||4||5||
Malaar, First Mehl, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Know that the creation was formed through air and water;
have no doubt that the body was made through fire.
And if you know where the soul comes from,
you shall be known as a wise religious scholar. ||1||
Who can know the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe, O mother?
Without seeing Him, we cannot say anything about Him.
How can anyone speak and describe Him, O mother? ||1||Pause||
He is high above the sky, and beneath the nether worlds.
How can I speak of Him? Let me understand.
In the heart, without the tongue is chanted,
who knows what sort of Name? ||2||
Undoubtedly, words fail me.
He alone understands, who is blessed.
Day and night, deep within, he remains lovingly attuned to the Lord.
He is the true person, who is merged in the True Lord. ||3||
If someone of high social standing becomes a selfless servant,
then his praises cannot even be expressed.
And if someone from a low social class becomes a selfless servant,
O Nanak, he shall wear shoes of honor. ||4||1||6||
Malaar, First Mehl:
The pain of separation - this is the hungry pain I feel.
Another pain is the attack of the Messenger of Death.
Another pain is the disease consuming my body.
O foolish doctor, don't give me medicine. ||1||
O foolish doctor, don't give me medicine.
The pain persists, and the body continues to suffer.
Your medicine has no effect on me. ||1||Pause||
Forgetting his Lord and Master, the mortal enjoys sensual pleasures;
then, disease rises up in his body.
The blind mortal receives his punishment.
O foolish doctor, don't give me medicine. ||2||
The value of sandalwood lies in its fragrance.
The value of the human lasts only as long as the breath in the body.
When the breath is taken away, the body crumbles into dust.
After that, no one takes any food. ||3||
The mortal's body is golden, and the soul-swan is immaculate and pure,
if even a tiny particle of the Immaculate Naam is within.
All pain and disease are eradicated.
O Nanak, the mortal is saved through the True Name. ||4||2||7||
Malaar, First Mehl:
Pain is the poison. The Lord's Name is the antidote.
Grind it up in the mortar of contentment, with the pestle of charitable giving.
