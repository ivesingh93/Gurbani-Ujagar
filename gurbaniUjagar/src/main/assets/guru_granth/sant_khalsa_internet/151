Raag Gauree Gwaarayree, First Mehl, Chau-Padas & Du-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:
The Fear of God is overpowering, and so very heavy,
while the intellect is lightweight, as is the speech one speaks.
So place the Fear of God upon your head, and bear that weight;
by the Grace of the Merciful Lord, contemplate the Guru. ||1||
Without the Fear of God, no one crosses over the world-ocean.
This Fear of God adorns the Love of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
The fire of fear within the body is burnt away by the Fear of God.
Through this Fear of God, we are adorned with the Word of the Shabad.
Without the Fear of God, all that is fashioned is false.
Useless is the mold, and useless are the hammer-strokes on the mold. ||2||
The desire for the worldly drama arises in the intellect,
but even with thousands of clever mental tricks, the heat of the Fear of God does not come into play.
O Nanak, the speech of the self-willed manmukh is just wind.
His words are worthless and empty, like the wind. ||3||1||
Gauree, First Mehl:
Place the Fear of God within the home of your heart; with this Fear of God in your heart, all other fears shall be frightened away.
What sort of fear is that, which frightens other fears?
Without You, I have no other place of rest at all.
Whatever happens is all according to Your Will. ||1||
Be afraid, if you have any fear, other than the Fear of God.
Afraid of fear, and living in fear, the mind is held in tumult. ||1||Pause||
The soul does not die; it does not drown, and it does not swim across.
The One who created everything does everything.
By the Hukam of His Command we come, and by the Hukam of His Command we go.
Before and after, His Command is pervading. ||2||
Cruelty, attachment, desire and egotism -
there is great hunger in these, like the raging torrent of a wild stream.
Let the Fear of God be your food, drink and support.
Without doing this, the fools simply die. ||3||
If anyone really has anyone else - how rare is that person!
All are Yours - You are the Lord of all.
All beings and creatures, wealth and property belong to Him.
O Nanak, it is so difficult to describe and contemplate Him. ||4||2||
Gauree, First Mehl:
Let wisdom be your mother, and contentment your father.
Let Truth be your brother - these are your best relatives. ||1||
He has been described, but He cannot be described at all.
Your All-pervading creative nature cannot be estimated. ||1||Pause||
