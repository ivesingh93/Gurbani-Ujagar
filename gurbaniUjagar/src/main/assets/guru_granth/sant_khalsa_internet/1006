You are eternal and unchanging, imperishable, invisible and infinite, O divine fascinating Lord.
Please bless Nanak with the gift of the Society of the Saints, and the dust of the feet of Your slaves. ||4||6||22||
Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:
The Saints are fulfilled and satisfied;
they know the Guru's Mantra and the Teachings.
They cannot even be described;
they are blessed with the glorious greatness of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||
My Beloved is a priceless jewel.
His Name is unattainable and immeasurable. ||1||Pause||
One whose mind is satisfied believing in the imperishable Lord God,
becomes Gurmukh and attains the essence of spiritual wisdom.
He sees all in his meditation.
He banishes egotistical pride from his mind. ||2||
Permanent is the place of those
who, through the Guru, realize the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.
Meeting the Guru, they remain awake and aware night and day;
they are committed to the Lord's service. ||3||
They are perfectly fulfilled and satisfied,
intuitively absorbed in Samaadhi.
The Lord's treasure comes into their hands;
O Nanak, through the Guru, they attain it. ||4||7||23||
Maaroo, Fifth Mehl, Sixth House, Du-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Abandon all your clever tricks; meet with the Holy, and renounce your egotistical pride.
Everything else is false; with your tongue, chant the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam. ||1||
O my mind, with your ears, listen to the Name of the Lord.
The sins of your many past lifetimes shall be washed away; then, what can the wretched Messenger of Death do to you? ||1||Pause||
Pain, poverty and fear shall not afflict you, and you shall find peace and pleasure.
By Guru's Grace, Nanak speaks; meditation on the Lord is the essence of spiritual wisdom. ||2||1||24||
Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:
Those who have forgotten the Naam, the Name of the Lord - I have seen them reduced to dust.
The love of children and friends, and the pleasures of married life are torn apart. ||1||
O my mind, continually, continuously chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
You shall not burn in the ocean of fire, and your mind and body shall be blessed with peace. ||1||Pause||
Like the shade of a tree, these things shall pass away, like the clouds blown away by the wind.
Meeting with the Holy, devotional worship to the Lord is implanted within; O Nanak, only this shall work for you. ||2||2||25||
Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:
The perfect, primal Lord is the Giver of peace; He is always with you.
He does not die, and he does not come or go in reincarnation. He does not perish, and He is not affected by heat or cold. ||1||
O my mind, be in love with the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Within the mind, think of the Lord, Har, Har, the treasure. This is the purest way of life. ||1||Pause||
Whoever meditates on the merciful compassionate Lord, the Lord of the Universe, is successful.
He is always new, fresh and young, clever and beautiful; Nanak's mind is pierced through with His Love. ||2||3||26||
Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:
While walking and sitting, sleeping and waking, contemplate within your heart the GurMantra.
RÃ¼n to the Lord's lotus feet, and join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. Cross over the terrifying world-ocean, and reach the other side. ||1||
