Dayv-Gandhaaree:
O mother, I hear of death, and think of it, and I am filled with fear.
Renouncing 'mine and yours' and egotism, I have sought the Sanctuary of the Lord and Master. ||1||Pause||
Whatever He says, I accept that as good. I do not say "No" to what He says.
Let me not forget Him, even for an instant; forgetting Him, I die. ||1||
The Giver of peace, God, the Perfect Creator, endures my great ignorance.
I am worthless, ugly and of low birth, O Nanak, but my Husband Lord is the embodiment of bliss. ||2||3||
Dayv-Gandhaaree:
O my mind, chant forever the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises.
By singing, hearing and meditating on Him, all, whether of high or low status, are saved. ||1||Pause||
He is absorbed into the One from which he originated, when he understands the Way.
Wherever this body was fashioned, it was not allowed to remain there. ||1||
Peace comes, and fear and doubt are dispelled, when God becomes Merciful.
Says Nanak, my hopes have been fulfilled, renouncing my greed in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||2||4||
Dayv-Gandhaaree:
O my mind, act as it pleases God.
Become the lowest of the low, the very least of the tiny, and speak in utmost humility. ||1||Pause||
The many ostentatious shows of Maya are useless; I withhold my love from these.
As something pleases my Lord and Master, in that I find my glory. ||1||
I am the slave of His slaves; becoming the dust of the feet of his slaves, I serve His humble servants.
I obtain all peace and greatness, O Nanak, living to chant His Name with my mouth. ||2||5||
Dayv-Gandhaaree:
Dear God, by Your Grace, my doubts have been dispelled.
By Your Mercy, all are mine; I reflect upon this in my mind. ||1||Pause||
Millions of sins are erased, by serving You; the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan drives away sorrow.
Chanting Your Name, I have obtained supreme peace, and my anxieties and diseases have been cast out. ||1||
Sexual desire, anger, greed, falsehood and slander are forgotten, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
The ocean of mercy has cut away the bonds of Maya; O Nanak, He has saved me. ||2||6||
Dayv-Gandhaaree:
All the cleverness of my mind is gone.
The Lord and Master is the Doer, the Cause of causes; Nanak holds tight to His Support. ||1||Pause||
Erasing my self-conceit, I have entered His Sanctuary; these are the Teachings spoken by the Holy Guru.
Surrendering to the Will of God, I attain peace, and the darkness of doubt is dispelled. ||1||
I know that You are all-wise, O God, my Lord and Master; I seek Your Sanctuary.
In an instant, You establish and disestablish; the value of Your Almighty Creative Power cannot be estimated. ||2||7||
Dayv-Gandhaaree, Fifth Mehl:
The Lord God is my praanaa, my breath of life; He is the Giver of peace.
By Guru's Grace, only a few know Him. ||1||Pause||
Your Saints are Your Beloveds; death does not consume them.
They are dyed in the deep crimson color of Your Love, and they are intoxicated with the sublime essence of the Lord's Name. ||1||
