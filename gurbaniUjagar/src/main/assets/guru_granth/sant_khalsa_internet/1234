It is the Destroyer of the sins, the guilt and fears of countless incarnations; the Gurmukh sees the One Lord. ||1||Pause||
Millions upon millions of sins are erased, when the mind comes to love the True Lord.
I do not know any other, except the Lord; the True Guru has revealed the One Lord to me. ||1||
Those whose hearts are filled with the wealth of the Lord's Love, remain intuitively absorbed in Him.
Imbued with the Shabad, they are dyed in the deep crimson color of His Love. They are imbued with the Lord's celestial peace and poise. ||2||
Contemplating the Shabad, the tongue is imbued with joy; embracing His Love, it is dyed a deep crimson.
I have come to know the Name of the Pure Detached Lord; my mind is satisfied and comforted. ||3||
The Pandits, the religious scholars, read and study, and all the silent sages have grown weary; they have grown weary of wearing their religious robes and wandering all around.
By Guru's Grace, I have found the Immaculate Lord; I contemplate the True Word of the Shabad. ||4||
My coming and going in reincarnation is ended, and I am imbued with Truth; the True Word of the Shabad is pleasing to my mind.
Serving the True Guru, eternal peace is found, and self-conceit is eliminated from within. ||5||
Through the True Word of the Shabad, the celestial melody wells up, and the mind is lovingly focused on the True Lord.
The Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Inaccessible and Unfathomable Lord, abides in the mind of the Gurmukh. ||6||
The whole world is contained in the One Lord. How rare are those who understand the One Lord.
One who dies in the Shabad comes to know everything; night and day, he realizes the One Lord. ||7||
That humble being, upon whom the Lord casts His Glance of Grace, understands. Nothing else can be said.
O Nanak, those who are imbued with the Naam are forever detached from the world; they are lovingly attuned to the One Word of the Shabad. ||8||2||
Saarang, Third Mehl:
O my mind, the Speech of the Lord is unspoken.
That humble being who is blessed by the Lord's Glance of Grace, obtains it. How rare is that Gurmukh who understands. ||1||Pause||
The Lord is Deep, Profound and Unfathomable, the Ocean of Excellence; He is realized through the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Mortals do their deeds in all sorts of ways, in the love of duality; but without the Shabad, they are insane. ||1||
That humble being who bathes in the Lord's Name becomes immaculate; he never becomes polluted again.
Without the Name, the whole world is polluted; wandering in duality, it loses its honor. ||2||
What should I grasp? What should I gather up or leave behind? I do not know.
O Dear Lord, Your Name is the Help and Support of those whom You bless with Your kindness and compassion. ||3||
The True Lord is the True Giver, the Architect of Destiny; as He pleases, He links mortals to the Name.
He alone comes to understand, who enters the Guru's Gate, whom the Lord Himself instructs. ||4||
Even gazing upon the wonders of the Lord, this mind does not think of Him. The world comes and goes in reincarnation.
Serving the True Guru, the mortal comes to understand, and finds the Door of Salvation. ||5||
Those who understand the Lord's Court, never suffer separation from him. The True Guru has imparted this understanding.
They practice truth, self-restraint and good deeds; their comings and goings are ended. ||6||
In the Court of the True Lord, they practice Truth. The Gurmukhs take the Support of the True Lord.
