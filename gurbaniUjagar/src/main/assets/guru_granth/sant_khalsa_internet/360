One who has obtained the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Immaculate Lord - his body enjoys the pleasure of spiritual wisdom. ||1||Pause||
In the Lord's City, he sits in his Yogic posture, and he forsakes his desires and conflicts.
The sound of the horn ever rings out its beautiful melody, and day and night, he is filled with the sound current of the Naad. ||2||
My cup is reflective meditation, and spiritual wisdom is my walking stick; to dwell in the Lord's Presence is the ashes I apply to my body.
The Praise of the Lord is my occupation; and to live as Gurmukh is my pure religion. ||3||
My arm-rest is to see the Lord's Light in all, although their forms and colors are so numerous.
Says Nanak, listen, O Bharthari Yogi: love only the Supreme Lord God. ||4||3||37||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
Make spiritual wisdom your molasses, and meditation your scented flowers; let good deeds be the herbs.
Let devotional faith be the distilling fire, and your love the ceramic cup. Thus the sweet nectar of life is distilled. ||1||
O Baba, the mind is intoxicated with the Naam, drinking in its Nectar. It remains absorbed in the Lord's Love.
Night and day, remaining attached to the Love of the Lord, the celestial music of the Shabad resounds. ||1||Pause||
The Perfect Lord naturally gives the cup of Truth, to the one upon whom He casts His Glance of Grace.
One who trades in this Nectar - how could he ever love the wine of the world? ||2||
The Teachings of the Guru, the Ambrosial Bani - drinking them in, one becomes acceptable and renowned.
Unto the one who loves the Lord's Court, and the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, of what use is liberation or paradise? ||3||
Imbued with the Lord's Praises, one is forever a Bairaagee, a renunciate, and one's life is not lost in the gamble.
Says Nanak, listen, O Bharthari Yogi: drink in the intoxicating nectar of the Lord. ||4||4||38||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
Having attacked Khuraasaan, Baabar terrified Hindustan.
The Creator Himself does not take the blame, but has sent the Mogal as the messenger of death.
There was so much slaughter that the people screamed. Didn't You feel compassion, Lord? ||1||
O Creator Lord, You are the Master of all.
If some powerful man strikes out against another man, then no one feels any grief in their mind. ||1||Pause||
But if a powerful tiger attacks a flock of sheep and kills them, then its master must answer for it.
This priceless country has been laid waste and defiled by dogs, and no one pays any attention to the dead.
You Yourself unite, and You Yourself separate; I gaze upon Your Glorious Greatness. ||2||
One may give himself a great name, and revel in the pleasures of the mind,
but in the Eyes of the Lord and Master, he is just a worm, for all the corn that he eats.
Only one who dies to his ego while yet alive, obtains the blessings, O Nanak, by chanting the Lord's Name. ||3||5||39||
Raag Aasaa, Second House, Third Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan is obtained by great good fortune.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, true detachment is obtained.
The six systems of philosophy are pervasive,
but the Guru's system is profound and unequalled. ||1||
