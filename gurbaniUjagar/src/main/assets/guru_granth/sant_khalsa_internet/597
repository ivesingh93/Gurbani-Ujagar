My mind is imbued with You, day and night and morning, O Lord; my tongue chants Your Name, and my mind meditates on You. ||2||
You are True, and I am absorbed into You; through the mystery of the Shabad, I shall ultimately become True as well.
Those who are imbued with the Naam day and night are pure, while those who die to be reborn are impure. ||3||
I do not see any other like the Lord; who else should I praise? No one is equal to Him.
Prays Nanak, I am the slave of His slaves; by Guru's Instruction, I know Him. ||4||5||
Sorat'h, First Mehl:
He is unknowable, infinite, unapproachable and imperceptible. He is not subject to death or karma.
His caste is casteless; He is unborn, self-illumined, and free of doubt and desire. ||1||
I am a sacrifice to the Truest of the True.
He has no form, no color and no features; through the True Word of the Shabad, He reveals Himself. ||Pause||
He has no mother, father, sons or relatives; He is free of sexual desire; He has no wife.
He has no ancestry; He is immaculate. He is infinite and endless; O Lord, Your Light is pervading all. ||2||
Deep within each and every heart, God is hidden; His Light is in each and every heart.
The heavy doors are opened by Guru's Instructions; one becomes fearless, in the trance of deep meditation. ||3||
The Lord created all beings, and placed death over the heads of all; all the world is under His Power.
Serving the True Guru, the treasure is obtained; living the Word of the Shabad, one is emancipated. ||4||
In the pure vessel, the True Name is contained; how few are those who practice true conduct.
The individual soul is united with the Supreme Soul; Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary, Lord. ||5||6||
Sorat'h, First Mehl:
Like a fish without water is the faithless cynic, who dies of thirst.
So shall you die, O mind, without the Lord, as your breath goes in vain. ||1||
O mind, chant the Lord's Name, and praise Him.
Without the Guru, how will you obtain this juice? The Guru shall unite you with the Lord. ||Pause||
For the Gurmukh, meeting with the Society of the Saints is like making a pilgrimage to a sacred shrine.
The benefit of bathing at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage is obtained by the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan. ||2||
Like the Yogi without abstinence, and like penance without truth and contentment,
so is the body without the Lord's Name; death will slay it, because of the sin within. ||3||
The faithless cynic does not obtain the Lord's Love; the Lord's Love is obtained only through the True Guru.
One who meets with the Guru, the Giver of pleasure and pain, says Nanak, is absorbed in the Lord's Praise. ||4||7||
Sorat'h, First Mehl:
You, God, are the Giver of gifts, the Lord of perfect understanding; I am a mere beggar at Your Door.
What should I beg for? Nothing remains permanent; O Lord, please, bless me with Your Beloved Name. ||1||
In each and every heart, the Lord, the Lord of the forest, is permeating and pervading.
In the water, on the land, and in the sky, He is pervading but hidden; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, He is revealed. ||Pause||
In this world, in the nether regions of the underworld, and in the Akaashic Ethers, the Guru, the True Guru, has shown me the Lord; He has showered me with His Mercy.
He is the unborn Lord God; He is, and shall ever be. Deep within your heart, behold Him, the Destroyer of ego. ||2||
