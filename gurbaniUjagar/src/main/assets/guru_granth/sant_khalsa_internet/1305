Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
How may I obtain the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan? ||1||Pause||
I hope and thirst for Your wish-fulfilling image; my heart yearns and longs for You. ||1||
The meek and humble Saints are like thirsty fish; the Saints of the Lord are absorbed in Him.
I am the dust of the feet of the Lord's Saints.
I dedicate my heart to them.
God has become Merciful to me.
Renouncing pride and leaving behind emotional attachment, O Nanak, one meets with the Dear Lord. ||2||2||35||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
The Playful Lord imbues all with the Color of His Love.
From the ant to the elephant, He is permeating and pervading all. ||1||Pause||
Some go on fasts, make vows, and take pilgrimages to sacred shrines on the Ganges.
They stand naked in the water, enduring hunger and poverty.
They sit cross-legged, perform worship services and do good deeds.
They apply religious symbols to their bodies, and ceremonial marks to their limbs.
They read through the Shaastras, but they do not join the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. ||1||
They stubbornly practice ritualistic postures, standing on their heads.
They are afflicted with the disease of egotism, and their faults are not covered up.
They burn in the fire of sexual frustration, unresolved anger and compulsive desire.
He alone is liberated, O Nanak, whose True Guru is Good. ||2||3||36||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl, Seventh House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
My thirst has been quenched, meeting with the Holy.
The five thieves have run away, and I am in peace and poise; singing, singing, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, I obtain the Blessed Vision of my Beloved. ||1||Pause||
That which God has done for me - how can I do that for Him in return?
I make my heart a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice to You. ||1||
First, I fall at the feet of the Saints; I meditate, meditate, lovingly attuned to You.
O God, where is that Place, where You contemplate all Your beings?
Countless slaves sing Your Praises.
He alone meets You, who is pleasing to Your Will. Servant Nanak remains absorbed in his Lord and Master.
You, You, You alone, Lord. ||2||1||37||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl, Eighth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Give up your pride and your self-conceit; the Loving, Merciful Lord is watching over all. O mind, become the dust of His Feet. ||1||Pause||
Through the Mantra of the Lord's Saints, experience the spiritual wisdom and meditation of the Lord of the World. ||1||
Within your heart, sing the Praises of the Lord of the Universe, and be lovingly attuned to His Lotus Feet. He is the Fascinating Lord, Merciful to the meek and the humble.
O Merciful Lord, please bless me with Your Kindness and Compassion.
Nanak begs for the Gift of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
I have abandoned emotional attachment, doubt and all egotistical pride. ||2||1||38||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
Speaking of God, filth and pollution are burnt away; This comes by meeting with the Guru, and not by any other efforts. ||1||Pause||
