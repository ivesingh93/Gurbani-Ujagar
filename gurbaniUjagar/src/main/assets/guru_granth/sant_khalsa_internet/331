Who dies? Who inflicts pain? ||1||
The Lord is the thug, who has drugged and robbed the whole world.
I am separated from the Lord; how can I survive, O my mother? ||1||Pause||
Whose husband is he? Whose wife is she?
Contemplate this reality within your body. ||2||
Says Kabeer, my mind is pleased and satisfied with the thug.
The effects of the drug have vanished, since I recognized the thug. ||3||39||
Now, the Lord, my King, has become my help and support.
I have cut away birth and death, and attained the supreme status. ||1||Pause||
He has united me with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
He has rescued me from the five demons.
I chant with my tongue and meditate on the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord.
He has made me his own slave. ||1||
The True Guru has blessed me with His generosity.
He has lifted me up, out of the world-ocean.
I have fallen in love with His Lotus Feet.
The Lord of the Universe dwells continually within my consciousness. ||2||
The burning fire of Maya has been extinguished.
My mind is contented with the Support of the Naam.
God, the Lord and Master, is totally permeating the water and the land.
Wherever I look, there is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. ||3||
He Himself has implanted His devotional worship within me.
By pre-ordained destiny, one meets Him, O my Siblings of Destiny.
When He grants His Grace, one is perfectly fulfilled.
Kabeer's Lord and Master is the Cherisher of the poor. ||4||40||
There is pollution in the water, and pollution on the land; whatever is born is polluted.
There is pollution in birth, and more pollution in death; all beings are ruined by pollution. ||1||
Tell me, O Pandit, O religious scholar: who is clean and pure?
Meditate on such spiritual wisdom, O my friend. ||1||Pause||
There is pollution in the eyes, and pollution in speech; there is pollution in the ears as well.
Standing up and sitting down, one is polluted; one's kitchen is polluted as well. ||2||
Everyone knows how to be caught, but hardly anyone knows how to escape.
Says Kabeer, those who meditate on the Lord within their hearts, are not polluted. ||3||41||
Gauree:
Resolve this one conflict for me, O Lord,
if you require any work from Your humble servant. ||1||Pause||
Is this mind greater, or the One to whom the mind is attuned?
Is the Lord greater, or one who knows the Lord? ||1||
Is Brahma greater, or the One who created Him?
Are the Vedas greater, or the One from which they came? ||2||
Says Kabeer, I have become depressed;
is the sacred shrine of pilgrimage greater, or the slave of the Lord? ||3||42||
Raag Gauree Chaytee:
Behold, O Siblings of Destiny, the storm of spiritual wisdom has come.
It has totally blown away the thatched huts of doubt, and torn apart the bonds of Maya. ||1||Pause||
The two pillars of double-mindedness have fallen, and the beams of emotional attachment have come crashing down.
The thatched roof of greed has caved in, and the pitcher of evil-mindedness has been broken. ||1||
Your servant is drenched with the rain that has fallen in this storm.
