He is inside all, and outside of all; He is untouched by love or hate.
Slave Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of the Lord of the Universe; the Beloved Lord is the Support of the mind. ||3||
I searched and searched, and found the immovable, unchanging home of the Lord.
I have seen that everything is transitory and perishable, and so I have linked my consciousness to the Lotus Feet of the Lord.
God is eternal and unchanging, and I am just His hand-maiden; He does not die, or come and go in reincarnation.
He is overflowing with Dharmic faith, wealth and success; He fulfills the desires of the mind.
The Vedas and the Simritees sing the Praises of the Creator, while the Siddhas, seekers and silent sages meditate on Him.
Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of his Lord and Master, the treasure of mercy; by great good fortune, he sings the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har. ||4||1||11||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Vaar Of Soohee, With Shaloks Of The Third Mehl:
Shalok, Third Mehl:
In her red robes, the discarded bride goes out, seeking enjoyment with another's husband.
She leaves the husband of her own home, enticed by her love of duality.
She finds it sweet, and eats it up; her excessive sensuality only makes her disease worse.
She forsakes the Lord, her sublime Husband, and then later, she suffers the pain of separation from Him.
But she who becomes Gurmukh, turns away from corruption and adorns herself, attuned to the Love of the Lord.
She enjoys her celestial Husband Lord, and enshrines the Lord's Name within her heart.
She is humble and obedient; she is His virtuous bride forever; the Creator unites her with Himself.
O Nanak, she who has obtained the True Lord as her husband, is a happy soul-bride forever. ||1||
Third Mehl:
O meek, red-robed bride, keep your Husband Lord always in your thoughts.
O Nanak, your life shall be embellished, and your generations shall be saved along with you. ||2||
Pauree:
He Himself established His throne, in the Akaashic ethers and the nether worlds.
By the Hukam of His Command, He created the earth, the true home of Dharma.
He Himself created and destroys; He is the True Lord, merciful to the meek.
You give sustenance to all; how wonderful and unique is the Hukam of Your Command!
You Yourself are permeating and pervading; You Yourself are the Cherisher. ||1||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
The red-robed woman becomes a happy soul-bride, only when she accepts the True Name.
Become pleasing to your True Guru, and you shall be totally beautified; otherwise, there is no place of rest.
So decorate yourself with the decorations that will never stain, and love the Lord day and night.
O Nanak, what is the character of the happy soul-bride? Within her, is Truth; her face is bright and radiant, and she is absorbed in her Lord and Master. ||1||
Third Mehl:
O people: I am in red, dressed in a red robe.
But my Husband Lord is not obtained by any robes; I have tried and tried, and given up wearing robes.
O Nanak, they alone obtain their Husband Lord, who listen to the Guru's Teachings.
Whatever pleases Him, happens. In this way, the Husband Lord is met. ||2||
