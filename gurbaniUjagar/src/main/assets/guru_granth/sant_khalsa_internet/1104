Says Kabeer, whoever is absorbed in the Naam remains lovingly absorbed in the Primal, Absolute Lord. ||4||4||
If You keep me far away from You, then tell me, what is liberation?
The One has many forms, and is contained within all; how can I be fooled now? ||1||
O Lord, where will You take me, to save me?
Tell me where, and what sort of liberation shall You give me? By Your Grace, I have already obtained it. ||1||Pause||
People talk of salvation and being saved, as long as they do not understand the essence of reality.
I have now become pure within my heart, says Kabeer, and my mind is pleased and appeased. ||2||5||
Raawan made castles and fortresses of gold, but he had to abandon them when he left. ||1||
Why do you act only to please your mind?
When Death comes and grabs you by the hair, then only the Name of the Lord will save you. ||1||Pause||
Death, and deathlessness are the creations of our Lord and Master; this show, this expanse, is only an entanglement.
Says Kabeer, those who have the sublime essence of the Lord in their hearts - in the end, they are liberated. ||2||6||
The body is a village, and the soul is the owner and farmer; the five farm-hands live there.
The eyes, nose, ears, tongue and sensory organs of touch do not obey any order. ||1||
O father, now I shall not live in this village.
The accountants summoned Chitar and Gupat, the recording scribes of the conscious and the unconscious, to ask for an account of each and every moment. ||1||Pause||
When the Righteous Judge of Dharma calls for my account, there shall be a very heavy balance against me.
The five farm-hands shall then run away, and the bailiff shall arrest the soul. ||2||
Says Kabeer, listen, O Saints: settle your accounts in this farm.
O Lord, please forgive Your slave now, in this life, so that he may not have to return again to this terrifying world-ocean. ||3||7||
Raag Maaroo, The Word Of Kabeer Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
No one has seen the Fearless Lord, O renunciate.
Without the Fear of God, how can the Fearless Lord be obtained? ||1||
If one sees the Presence of his Husband Lord near at hand, then he feels the Fear of God, O renunciate.
If he realizes the Hukam of the Lord's Command, then he becomes fearless. ||2||
Don't practice hypocrisy with the Lord, O renunciate!
The whole world is filled with hypocrisy. ||3||
Thirst and desire do not just go away, O renunciate.
The body is burning in the fire of worldly love and attachment. ||4||
Anxiety is burned, and the body is burned, O renunciate,
only if one lets his mind become dead. ||5||
Without the True Guru, there can be no renunciation,
even though all the people may wish for it. ||6||
When God grants His Grace, one meets the True Guru, O renunciate,
and automatically, intuitively finds that Lord. ||7||
Says Kabeer, I offer this one prayer, O renunciate.
Carry me across the terrifying world-ocean. ||8||1||8||
