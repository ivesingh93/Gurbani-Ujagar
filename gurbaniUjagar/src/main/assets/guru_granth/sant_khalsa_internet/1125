Raag Bhairao, First Mehl, First House, Chau-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:
Without You, nothing happens.
You create the creatures, and gazing on them, you know them. ||1||
What can I say? I cannot say anything.
Whatever exists, is by Your Will. ||Pause||
Whatever is to be done, rests with You.
Unto whom should I offer my prayer? ||2||
I speak and hear the Bani of Your Word.
You Yourself know all Your Wondrous Play. ||3||
You Yourself act, and inspire all to act; only You Yourself know.
Says Nanak, You, Lord, see, establish and disestablish. ||4||1||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Raag Bhairao, First Mehl, Second House:
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, so many silent sages have been saved; Indra and Brahma have also been saved.
Sanak, Sanandan and many humble men of austerity, by Guru's Grace, have been carried across to the other side. ||1||
Without the Word of the Shabad, how can anyone cross over the terrifying world-ocean?
Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the world is entangled in the disease of duality, and is drowned, drowned, and dies. ||1||Pause||
The Guru is Divine; the Guru is Inscrutable and Mysterious. Serving the Guru, the three worlds are known and understood.
The Guru, the Giver, has Himself given me the Gift; I have obtained the Inscrutable, Mysterious Lord. ||2||
The mind is the king; the mind is appeased and satisfied through the mind itself, and desire is stilled in the mind.
The mind is the Yogi, the mind wastes away in separation from the Lord; singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, the mind is instructed and reformed. ||3||
How very rare are those in this world who, through the Guru, subdue their minds, and contemplate the Word of the Shabad.
O Nanak, our Lord and Master is All-pervading; through the True Word of the Shabad, we are emancipated. ||4||1||2||
Bhairao, First Mehl:
The eyes lose their sight, and the body withers away; old age overtakes the mortal, and death hangs over his head.
Beauty, loving attachment and the pleasures of life are not permanent. How can anyone escape from the noose of death? ||1||
O mortal, meditate on the Lord - your life is passing away!
