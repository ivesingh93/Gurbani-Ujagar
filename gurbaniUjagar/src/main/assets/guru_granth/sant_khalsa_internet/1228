Granting His Grace, He has made me His Own. The thirst for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan wells up within me.
Joining the Society of the Saints, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord; I have given up other hopes. ||1||
The Saint has pulled me out of the utterly desolate wilderness, and shown me the path.
Gazing upon His Darshan, all sins are taken away; Nanak is blessed with the jewel of the Lord. ||2||100||123||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
O mother, I am involved with the Love of the Lord;
I am intoxicated with it. My mind has such a longing and thirst for the Blessed Vision, the Darshan of my Beauteous Lord. No one can break this. ||1||Pause||
The Lord is my breath of life, honor, spouse, parent, child, relative, wealth - everything.
Cursed is this body of bones, this pile of maggots and manure, if it knows any other than the Lord. ||1||
The Destroyer of the pains of the poor has become merciful to me, by the power of the karma of my past actions.
Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of God, the Treasure, the Ocean of Mercy; my subservience to others is past. ||2||101||124||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
The Lord's melody is noble and sublime.
The Lotus Feet of my Lord and Master are incomparably beautiful. Meditating on them, one becomes Holy. ||1||Pause||
Just by thinking of the Darshan, the Blessed Vision of the Lord of the World, the dirty sins are washed away.
The Lord cuts down and weeds out the corruption of the cycle of birth and death. ||1||
How rare is that person who has such pre-ordained destiny, to find the Lord.
Chanting the Glorious Praises of the Creator, the Lord of the Universe - O Nanak, this is Truth. ||2||102||125||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
The intellect of one who dwells on the Name of the Lord is excellent.
One who forgets the Lord and becomes involved with some other - all his showy pretensions are false. ||1||Pause||
Meditate, vibrate on our Lord and Master in the Company of the Holy, and your sins shall be eradicated.
When the Lord's Lotus Feet abide within the heart, the mortal is never again caught in the cycle of death and birth. ||1||
He showers us with His kindness and compassion; He saves and protects those who take the Support of the Naam, the Name of the One Lord.
Meditating in remembrance on Him, day and night, O Nanak, your face shall be radiant in the Court of the Lord. ||2||103||126||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Honored - you shall be honored in the Court of the Lord.
Join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord; your egotistical pride will be totally dispelled. ||1||Pause||
Showering His kindness and compassion, He shall make you His Own. As Gurmukh, your spiritual wisdom shall be perfect.
All peace and all sorts of ecstasy are obtained, by meditating on the Darshan, the Blessed Vision of my Lord and Master. ||1||
She who dwells close to her Lord is always the pure, happy soul-bride; she is famous in the ten directions.
She is imbued with the Love of her Loving Beloved Lord; Nanak is a sacrifice to her. ||2||104||127||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
O Lord, I take the Support of Your Lotus Feet.
You are my Best Friend and Companion; I am with You. You are our Protector, O Lord of the Universe. ||1||Pause||
You are mine, and I am Yours; here and hereafter, You are my Saving Grace.
You are Endless and Infinite, O my Lord and Master; by Guru's Grace, a few understand. ||1||
Without being spoken, without being told, You know all, O Searcher of hearts.
One whom God unites with Himself, O Nanak, that humble being is honored in the Court of the Lord. ||2||105||128||
