You pulled me out of the deep, dark well onto the dry ground.
Showering Your Mercy, You blessed Your servant with Your Glance of Grace.
I sing the Glorious Praises of the Perfect, Immortal Lord. By speaking and hearing these Praises, they are not used up. ||4||
Here and hereafter, You are our Protector.
In the womb of the mother, You cherish and nurture the baby.
The fire of Maya does not affect those who are imbued with the Lord's Love; they sing His Glorious Praises. ||5||
What Praises of Yours can I chant and contemplate?
Deep within my mind and body, I behold Your Presence.
You are my Friend and Companion, my Lord and Master. Without You, I do not know any other at all. ||6||
O God, that one, unto whom You have given shelter,
is not touched by the hot winds.
O my Lord and Master, You are my Sanctuary, the Giver of peace. Chanting, meditating on You in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, You are revealed. ||7||
You are Exalted, Unfathomable, Infinite and Invaluable.
You are my True Lord and Master. I am Your servant and slave.
You are the King, Your Sovereign RÃ¼le is True. Nanak is a sacrifice, a sacrifice to You. ||8||3||37||
Maajh, Fifth Mehl, Second House:
Continually, continuously, remember the Merciful Lord.
Never forget Him from your mind. ||Pause||
Join the Society of the Saints,
and you shall not have to go down the path of Death.
Take the Provisions of the Lord's Name with you, and no stain shall attach itself to your family. ||1||
Those who meditate on the Master
shall not be thrown down into hell.
Even the hot winds shall not touch them. The Lord has come to dwell within their minds. ||2||
They alone are beautiful and attractive,
who abide in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
Those who have gathered in the wealth of the Lord's Name-they alone are deep and thoughtful and vast. ||3||
Drink in the Ambrosial Essence of the Name,
and live by beholding the face of the Lord's servant.
Let all your affairs be resolved, by continually worshipping the Feet of the Guru. ||4||
Whom the Lord has made His Own.
he alone meditates on the Lord of the World.
He alone is a warrior, and he alone is the chosen one, upon whose forehead good destiny is recorded. ||5||
Within my mind, I meditate on God.
For me, this is like the enjoyment of princely pleasures.
Evil does not well up within me, since I am saved, and dedicated to truthful actions. ||6||
I have enshrined the Creator within my mind;
I have obtained the fruits of life's rewards.
If your Husband Lord is pleasing to your mind, then your married life shall be eternal. ||7||
I have obtained everlasting wealth;
I have found the Sanctuary of the Dispeller of fear.
Grasping hold of the hem of the Lord's robe, Nanak is saved. He has won the incomparable life. ||8||4||38||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Maajh, Fifth Mehl, Third House:
Chanting and meditating on the Lord, the mind is held steady. ||1||Pause||
Meditating, meditating in remembrance on the Divine Guru, one's fears are erased and dispelled. ||1||
Entering the Sanctuary of the Supreme Lord God, how could anyone feel grief any longer? ||2||
