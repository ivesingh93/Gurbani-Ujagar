Become Gurmukh, and meditate forever on the Dear Lord, the One and Only Creator. ||1||Pause||
The faces of the Gurmukhs are radiant and bright; they reflect on the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
They obtain peace in this world and the next, chanting and meditating within their hearts on the Lord.
Within the home of their own inner being, they obtain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, reflecting on the Guru's Shabad. ||2||
Those who turn their faces away from the True Guru shall have their faces blackened.
Night and day, they suffer in pain; they see the noose of Death always hovering above them.
Even in their dreams, they find no peace; they are consumed by the fires of intense anxiety. ||3||
The One Lord is the Giver of all; He Himself bestows all blessings.
No one else has any say in this; He gives just as He pleases.
O Nanak, the Gurmukhs obtain Him; He Himself knows Himself. ||4||9||42||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Serve your True Lord and Master, and you shall be blessed with true greatness.
By Guru's Grace, He abides in the mind, and egotism is driven out.
This wandering mind comes to rest, when the Lord casts His Glance of Grace. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, become Gurmukh, and meditate on the Name of the Lord.
The Treasure of the Naam abides forever within the mind, and one's place of rest is found in the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. ||1||Pause||
The minds and bodies of the self-willed manmukhs are filled with darkness; they find no shelter, no place of rest.
Through countless incarnations they wander lost, like crows in a deserted house.
Through the Guru's Teachings, the heart is illuminated. Through the Shabad, the Name of the Lord is received. ||2||
In the corruption of the three qualities, there is blindness; in attachment to Maya, there is darkness.
The greedy people serve others, instead of the Lord, although they loudly announce their reading of scriptures.
They are burnt to death by their own corruption; they are not at home, on either this shore or the one beyond. ||3||
In attachment to Maya, they have forgotten the Father, the Cherisher of the World.
Without the Guru, all are unconscious; they are held in bondage by the Messenger of Death.
O Nanak, through the Guru's Teachings, you shall be saved, contemplating the True Name. ||4||10||43||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
The three qualities hold people in attachment to Maya. The Gurmukh attains the fourth state of higher consciousness.
Granting His Grace, God unites us with Himself. The Name of the Lord comes to abide within the mind.
Those who have the treasure of goodness join the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, follow the Guru's Teachings and dwell in truth.
Practice truth, and only truth, and merge in the True Word of the Shabad. ||1||Pause||
I am a sacrifice to those who recognize the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Renouncing selfishness, I fall at their feet, and walk in harmony with His Will.
Earning the Profit of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, I am intuitively absorbed in the Naam. ||2||
Without the Guru, the Mansion of the Lord's Presence is not found, and the Naam is not obtained.
Seek and find such a True Guru, who shall lead you to the True Lord.
Destroy your evil passions, and you shall dwell in peace. Whatever pleases the Lord comes to pass. ||3||
As one knows the True Guru, so is the peace obtained.
There is no doubt at all about this, but those who love Him are very rare.
O Nanak, the One Light has two forms; through the Shabad, union is attained. ||4||11||44||
