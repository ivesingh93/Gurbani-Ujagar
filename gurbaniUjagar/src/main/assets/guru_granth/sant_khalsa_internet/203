Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
O Brave and Powerful God, Ocean of Peace, I fell into the pit - please, take my hand. ||1||Pause||
My ears do not hear, and my eyes are not beautiful. I am in such pain; I am a poor cripple, crying at Your Door. ||1||
O Master of the poor and helpless, O Embodiment of Compassion, You are my Friend and Intimate, my Father and Mother.
Nanak holds tight to the Lord's Lotus Feet in his heart; thus the Saints cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||2||2||115||
Raag Gauree Bairaagan, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O Dear Lord God, my Best Friend, please, abide with me. ||1||Pause||
Without You, I cannot live, even for an instant, and my life in this world is cursed.
O Breath of Life of the soul, O Giver of peace, each and every instant I am a sacrifice to You. ||1||
Please, God, give me the Support of Your Hand; lift me up and pull me out of this pit, O Lord of the World.
I am worthless, with such a shallow intellect; You are always Merciful to the meek. ||2||
What comforts of Yours can I dwell upon? How can I contemplate You?
You lovingly absorb Your slaves into Your Sanctuary, O Lofty, Inaccessible and Infinite Lord. ||3||
All wealth, and the eight miraculous spiritual powers are in the supremely sublime essence of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Those humble beings, with whom the beautifully-haired Lord is thoroughly pleased, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||4||
You are my mother, father, son and relative; You are the Support of the breath of life.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, Nanak meditates on the Lord, and swims across the poisonous world-ocean. ||5||1||116||
Gauree Bairaagan, Chhants Of Rehoay, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Is there anyone who will sing of the Beloved Lord?
Surely, this will bring all pleasures and comforts. ||Pause||
The renunciate goes out into the woods, searching for Him.
But those who embrace love for the One Lord are very rare.
Those who find the Lord are very fortunate and blessed. ||1||
The Gods like Brahma and Sanak yearn for Him;
the Yogis, celibates and Siddhas yearn for the Lord.
One who is so blessed, sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||2||
I seek the Sanctuary of those who have not forgotten Him.
By great good fortune, one meets the Lord's Saint.
They are not subject to the cycle of birth and death. ||3||
Show Your Mercy, and lead me to meet You, O my Darling Beloved.
Hear my prayer, O Lofty and Infinite God;
Nanak begs for the Support of Your Name. ||4||1||117||
