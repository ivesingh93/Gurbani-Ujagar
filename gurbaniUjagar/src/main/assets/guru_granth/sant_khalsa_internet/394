My treasure-house is overflowing with rubies and jewels;
I meditate on the Formless Lord, and so they never run short.
How rare is that humble being, who drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Word of the Shabad.
O Nanak, he attains the state of highest dignity. ||2||41||92||
Aasaa, Seventh House, Fifth Mehl:
Meditate continually on the Name of the Lord within your heart.
Thus you shall save all your companions and associates. ||1||
My Guru is always with me, near at hand.
Meditating, meditating in remembrance on Him, I cherish Him forever. ||1||Pause||
Your actions seem so sweet to me.
Nanak begs for the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||42||93||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The world is saved by the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
The Name of the Lord is the Support of the mind. ||1||
The Saints worship and adore the Lotus Feet of the Divine Guru;
they love the Beloved Lord. ||1||Pause||
She who has such good destiny written upon her forehead,
says Nanak, is blessed with the eternal happy marriage with the Lord. ||2||43||94||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The Order of my Husband Lord seems so sweet to me.
My Husband Lord has driven out the one who was my rival.
My Beloved Husband has decorated me, His happy soul-bride.
He has quieted the burning thirst of my mind. ||1||
It is good that I submitted to the Will of my Beloved Lord.
I have realized celestial peace and poise within this home of mine. ||Pause||
I am the hand-maiden, the attendant of my Beloved Lord.
He is eternal and imperishable, inaccessible and infinite.
Holding the fan, sitting at His Feet, I wave it over my Beloved.
The five demons who tortured me have run away. ||2||
I am not from a noble family, and I am not beautiful.
What do I know? Why am I pleasing to my Beloved?
I am a poor orphan, destitute and dishonored.
My Husband took me in, and made me His queen. ||3||
When I saw my Beloved's face before me,
I became so happy and peaceful; my married life was blessed.
Says Nanak, my desires are fulfilled.
The True Guru has united me with God, the treasure of excellence. ||4||1||95||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
A frown creases her forehead, and her look is evil.
Her speech is bitter, and her tongue is rude.
She is always hungry, and she believes her Husband to be far away. ||1||
Such is Maya, the woman, which the One Lord has created.
She is devouring the whole world, but the Guru has saved me, O my Siblings of Destiny. ||Pause||
Administering her poisons, she has overcome the whole world.
She has bewitched Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.
Only those Gurmukhs who are attuned to the Naam are blessed. ||2||
Performing fasts, religious observances and atonements, the mortals have grown weary.
They wander over the entire planet, on pilgrimages to the banks of sacred rivers.
But they alone are saved, who seek the Sanctuary of the True Guru. ||3||
Attached to Maya, the whole world is in bondage.
The foolish self-willed manmukhs are consumed by their egotism.
Taking me by the arm, Guru Nanak has saved me. ||4||2||96||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Everything is painful, when one forgets the Lord Master.
Here and hereafter, such a mortal is useless. ||1||
The Saints are satisfied, meditating on the Lord, Har, Har.
