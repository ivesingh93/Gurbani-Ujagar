I serve the True Guru; the Word of His Shabad is beautiful.
Through it, the Name of the Lord comes to dwell within the mind.
The Pure Lord removes the filth of egotism, and we are honored in the True Court. ||2||
Without the Guru, the Naam cannot be obtained.
The Siddhas and the seekers lack it; they weep and wail.
Without serving the True Guru, peace is not obtained; through perfect destiny, the Guru is found. ||3||
This mind is a mirror; how rare are those who, as Gurmukh, see themselves in it.
RÃ¼st does not stick to those who burn their ego.
The Unstruck Melody of the Bani resounds through the Pure Word of the Shabad; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, we are absorbed into the True One. ||4||
Without the True Guru, the Lord cannot be seen.
Granting His Grace, He Himself has allowed me to see Him.
All by Himself, He Himself is permeating and pervading; He is intuitively absorbed in celestial peace. ||5||
One who becomes Gurmukh embraces love for the One.
Doubt and duality are burned away by the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Within his body, he deals and trades, and obtains the Treasure of the True Name. ||6||
The life-style of the Gurmukh is sublime; he sings the Praises of the Lord.
The Gurmukh finds the gate of salvation.
Night and day, he is imbued with the Lord's Love. He sings the Lord's Glorious Praises, and he is called to the Mansion of His Presence. ||7||
The True Guru, the Giver, is met when the Lord leads us to meet Him.
Through perfect destiny, the Shabad is enshrined in the mind.
O Nanak, the greatness of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is obtained by chanting the Glorious Praises of the True Lord. ||8||9||10||
Maajh, Third Mehl:
Those who lose their own selves obtain everything.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they enshrine Love for the True one.
They trade in Truth, they gather in Truth, and they deal only in Truth. ||1||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, night and day.
I am Yours, You are my Lord and Master. You bestow greatness through the Word of Your Shabad. ||1||Pause||
That time, that moment is totally beautiful,
when the True One becomes pleasing to my mind.
Serving the True One, true greatness is obtained. By Guru's Grace, the True One is obtained. ||2||
The food of spiritual love is obtained when the True Guru is pleased.
Other essences are forgotten, when the Lord's Essence comes to dwell in the mind.
Truth, contentment and intuitive peace and poise are obtained from the Bani, the Word of the Perfect Guru. ||3||
The blind and ignorant fools do not serve the True Guru;
how will they find the gate of salvation?
They die and die, over and over again, only to be reborn, over and over again. They are struck down at Death's Door. ||4||
Those who know the essence of the Shabad, understand their own selves.
Immaculate is the speech of those who chant the Word of the Shabad.
Serving the True One, they find a lasting peace; they enshrine the nine treasures of the Naam within their minds. ||5||
Beautiful is that place, which is pleasing to the Lord's Mind.
There, sitting in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, the Glorious Praises of the Lord are sung.
Night and day, the True One is praised; the Immaculate Sound-current of the Naad resounds there. ||6||
