The more one feels hunger for other tastes and pleasures, the more this hunger persists.
Those unto whom the Lord Himself shows mercy, sell their head to the Guru.
Servant Nanak is satisfied by the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. He shall never feel hungry again. ||4||4||10||48||
Gauree Bairaagan, Fourth Mehl:
Within my conscious mind is the constant longing for the Lord. How can I behold the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, Lord?
One who loves the Lord knows this; the Lord is very dear to my conscious mind.
I am a sacrifice to my Guru, who has re-united me with my Creator Lord; I was separated from Him for such a long time! ||1||
O my Lord, I am a sinner; I have come to Your Sanctuary, and fallen at Your Door, Lord.
My intellect is worthless; I am filthy and polluted. Please shower me with Your Mercy sometime. ||1||Pause||
My demerits are so many and numerous. I have sinned so many times, over and over again. O Lord, they cannot be counted.
You, Lord, are the Merciful Treasure of Virtue. When it pleases You, Lord, You forgive me.
I am a sinner, saved only by the Company of the Guru. He has bestowed the Teachings of the Lord's Name, which saves me. ||2||
What Glorious Virtues of Yours can I describe, O my True Guru? When the Guru speaks, I am transfixed with wonder.
Can anyone else save a sinner like me? The True Guru has protected and saved me.
O Guru, You are my father. O Guru, You are my mother. O Guru, You are my relative, companion and friend. ||3||
My condition, O my True Guru - that condition, O Lord, is known only to You.
I was rolling around in the dirt, and no one cared for me at all. In the Company of the Guru, the True Guru, I, the worm, have been raised up and exalted.
Blessed, blessed is the Guru of servant Nanak; meeting Him, all my sorrows and troubles have come to an end. ||4||5||11||49||
Gauree Bairaagan, Fourth Mehl:
The soul of the man is lured by gold and women; emotional attachment to Maya is so sweet to him.
The mind has become attached to the pleasures of houses, palaces, horses and other enjoyments.
The Lord God does not even enter his thoughts; how can he be saved, O my Lord King? ||1||
O my Lord, these are my lowly actions, O my Lord.
O Lord, Har, Har, Treasure of Virtue, Merciful Lord: please bless me with Your Grace and forgive me for all my mistakes. ||1||Pause||
I have no beauty, no social status, no manners.
With what face am I to speak? I have no virtue at all; I have not chanted Your Name.
I am a sinner, saved only by the Company of the Guru. This is the generous blessing of the True Guru. ||2||
He gave all beings souls, bodies, mouths, noses and water to drink.
He gave them corn to eat, clothes to wear, and other pleasures to enjoy.
But they do not remember the One who gave them all this. The animals think that they made themselves! ||3||
You made them all; You are all-pervading. You are the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.
What can these wretched creatures do? This whole drama is Yours, O Lord and Master.
Servant Nanak was purchased in the slave-market. He is the slave of the Lord's slaves. ||4||6||12||50||
