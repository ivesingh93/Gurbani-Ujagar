The mind is overflowing with the greasy dirt of egotistical pride.
With the dust of the feet of the Holy, it is scrubbed clean. ||1||
The body may be washed with loads of water,
and yet its filth is not removed, and it does not become clean. ||2||
I have met the True Guru, who is merciful forever.
Meditating, meditating in remembrance on the Lord, I am rid of the fear of death. ||3||
Liberation, pleasures and worldly success are all in the Lord's Name.
With loving devotional worship, O Nanak, sing His Glorious Praises. ||4||100||169||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
The Lord's slaves attain the highest status of life.
Meeting them, the soul is enlightened. ||1||
Those who listen with their mind and ears to the Lord's meditative remembrance,
are blessed with peace at the Lord's Gate, O mortal. ||1||Pause||
Twenty-four hours a day, meditate on the Sustainer of the World.
O Nanak, gazing on the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, I am enraptured. ||2||101||170||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Peace and tranquility have come; the Guru, the Lord of the Universe, has brought it.
The burning sins have departed, O my Siblings of Destiny. ||1||Pause||
With your tongue, continually chant the Lord's Name.
Disease shall depart, and you shall be saved. ||1||
Contemplate the Glorious Virtues of the Unfathomable Supreme Lord God.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, you shall be emancipated. ||2||
Sing the Glories of God each and every day;
your afflictions shall be dispelled, and you shall be saved, my humble friend. ||3||
In thought, word and deed, I meditate on my God.
Slave Nanak has come to Your Sanctuary. ||4||102||171||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
The Divine Guru has opened his eyes.
Doubt has been dispelled; my service has been successful. ||1||Pause||
The Giver of joy has saved him from smallpox.
The Supreme Lord God has granted His Grace. ||1||
O Nanak, he alone lives, who chants the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, drink deeply of the Lord's Ambrosial Nectar. ||2||103||172||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Blessed is that forehead, and blessed are those eyes;
blessed are those devotees who are in love with You. ||1||
Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, how anyone find peace?
With your tongue, chant the Praises of the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Nanak is a sacrifice to those
who meditate on the Lord of Nirvaanaa. ||2||104||173||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
You are my Advisor; You are always with me.
You preserve, protect and care for me. ||1||
Such is the Lord, our Help and Support in this world and the next.
He protects the honor of His slave, O my Sibling of Destiny. ||1||Pause||
He alone exists hereafter; this place is in His Power.
Twenty-four hours a day, O my mind, chant and meditate on the Lord. ||2||
His honor is acknowledged, and he bears the True Insignia;
the Lord Himself issues His Royal Command. ||3||
He Himself is the Giver; He Himself is the Cherisher.
Continually, continuously, O Nanak, dwell upon the Name of the Lord. ||4||105||174||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
When the Perfect True Guru becomes merciful,
the Lord of the World abides in the heart forever. ||1||
Meditating on the Lord, I have found eternal peace.
