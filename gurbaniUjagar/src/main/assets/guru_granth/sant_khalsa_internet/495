Goojaree, Fifth Mehl, Chau-Padas, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Why, O mind, do you contrive your schemes, when the Dear Lord Himself provides for your care?
From rocks and stones, He created the living beings, and He places before them their sustenance. ||1||
O my Dear Lord of Souls, one who meets with the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, is saved.
By Guru's Grace, he obtains the supreme status, and the dry branch blossoms forth in greenery. ||1||Pause||
Mother, father, friends, children, and spouse - no one is the support of any other.
For each and every individual, the Lord and Master provides sustenance; why do you fear, O my mind? ||2||
The flamingoes fly hundreds of miles, leaving their young ones behind.
Who feeds them, and who teaches them to feed themselves? Have you ever thought of this in your mind? ||3||
All treasures and the eighteen supernatural spiritual powers of the Siddhas are held by the Lord and Master in the palm of His hand.
Servant Nanak is devoted, dedicated, and forever a sacrifice to You - Your vast expanse has no limit. ||4||1||
Goojaree, Fifth Mehl, Chau-Padas, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
They perform the four rituals and six religious rites; the world is engrossed in these.
They are not cleansed of the filth of their ego within; without the Guru, they lose the game of life. ||1||
O my Lord and Master, please, grant Your Grace and preserve me.
Out of millions, hardly anyone is a servant of the Lord. All the others are mere traders. ||1||Pause||
I have searched all the Shaastras, the Vedas and the Simritees, and they all affirm one thing:
without the Guru, no one obtains liberation; see, and reflect upon this in your mind. ||2||
Even if one takes cleansing baths at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage, and wanders over the whole planet,
and performs all the rituals of purification day and night, still, without the True Guru, there is only darkness. ||3||
Roaming and wandering around, I have travelled over the whole world, and now, I have arrived at the Lord's Door.
The Lord has eliminated my evil-mindedness, and enlightened my intellect; O servant Nanak, the Gurmukhs are saved. ||4||1||2||
Goojaree, Fifth Mehl:
The wealth of the Lord is my chanting, the wealth of the Lord is my deep meditation; the wealth of the Lord is the food I enjoy.
I do not forget the Lord, Har, Har, from my mind, even for an instant; I have found Him in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||1||
O mother, your son has returned home with a profit:
the wealth of the Lord while walking, the wealth of the Lord while sitting, and the wealth of the Lord while waking and sleeping. ||1||Pause||
The wealth of the Lord is my cleansing bath, the wealth of the Lord is my wisdom; I center my meditation on the Lord.
The wealth of the Lord is my raft, the wealth of the Lord is my boat; the Lord, Har, Har, is the ship to carry me across. ||2||
