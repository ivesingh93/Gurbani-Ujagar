Aasaa, Third Mehl:
Those who recognize their own selves, enjoy the sweet flavor, O Siblings of Destiny.
Those who drink in the sublime essence of the Lord are emancipated; they love the Truth. ||1||
The Beloved Lord is the purest of the pure; He comes to dwell in the pure mind.
Praising the Lord, through the Guru's Teachings, one remains unaffected by corruption. ||1||Pause||
Without the Word of the Shabad, they do not understand themselves -they are totally blind, O Siblings of Destiny.
Through the Guru's Teachings, the heart is illuminated, and in the end, only the Naam shall be your companion. ||2||
They are occupied with the Naam, and only the Naam; they deal only in the Naam.
Deep within their hearts is the Naam; upon their lips is the Naam; they contemplate the Word of God, and the Naam. ||3||
They listen to the Naam, believe in the Naam, and through the Naam, they obtain glory.
They praise the Naam, forever and ever, and through the Naam, they obtain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. ||4||
Through the Naam, their hearts are illumined, and through the Naam, they obtain honor.
Through the Naam, peace wells up; I seek the Sanctuary of the Naam. ||5||
Without the Naam, no one is accepted; the self-willed manmukhs lose their honor.
In the City of Death, they are tied down and beaten, and they lose their lives in vain. ||6||
Those Gurmukhs who realize the Naam, all serve the Naam.
So believe in the Naam, and only the Naam; through the Naam, glorious greatness is obtained. ||7||
He alone receives it, unto whom it is given. Through the Guru's Teachings, the Naam is realized.
O Nanak, everything is under the influence of the Naam; by perfect good destiny, a few obtain it. ||8||7||29||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
The deserted brides do not obtain the Mansion of their Husband's Presence, nor do they know His taste.
They speak harsh words, and do not bow to Him; they are in love with another. ||1||
How can this mind come under control?
By Guru's Grace, it is held in check; instructed in spiritual wisdom, it returns to its home. ||1||Pause||
He Himself adorns the happy soul-brides; they bear Him love and affection.
They live in harmony with the Sweet Will of the True Guru, naturally adorned with the Naam. ||2||
They enjoy their Beloved forever, and their bed is decorated with Truth.
They are fascinated with the Love of their Husband Lord; meeting their Beloved, they obtain peace. ||3||
Spiritual wisdom is the incomparable decoration of the happy soul-bride.
She is so beautiful - she is the queen of all; she enjoys the love and affection of her Husband Lord. ||4||
The True Lord, the Unseen, the Infinite, has infused His Love among the happy soul-brides.
They serve their True Guru, with true love and affection. ||5||
The happy soul-bride has adorned herself with the necklace of virtue.
She applies the perfume of love to her body, and within her mind is the jewel of reflective meditation. ||6||
Those who are imbued with devotional worship are the most exalted. Their social standing and honor come from the Word of the Shabad.
Without the Naam, all are low class, like maggots in manure. ||7||
Everyone proclaims, "Me, me!"; but without the Shabad, the ego does not depart.
O Nanak, those who are imbued with the Naam lose their ego; they remain absorbed in the True Lord. ||8||8||30||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
Those who are imbued with the True Lord are spotless and pure; their reputation is forever true.
Here, they are known in each and every home, and hereafter, they are famous throughout the ages. ||1||
