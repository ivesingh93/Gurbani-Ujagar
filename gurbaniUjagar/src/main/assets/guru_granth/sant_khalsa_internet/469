Their subjects are blind, and without wisdom, they try to please the will of the dead.
The spiritually wise dance and play their musical instruments, adorning themselves with beautiful decorations.
They shout out loud, and sing epic poems and heroic stories.
The fools call themselves spiritual scholars, and by their clever tricks, they love to gather wealth.
The righteous waste their righteousness, by asking for the door of salvation.
They call themselves celibate, and abandon their homes, but they do not know the true way of life.
Everyone calls himself perfect; none call themselves imperfect.
If the weight of honor is placed on the scale, then, O Nanak, one sees his true weight. ||2||
First Mehl:
Evil actions become publicly known; O Nanak, the True Lord sees everything.
Everyone makes the attempt, but that alone happens which the Creator Lord does.
In the world hereafter, social status and power mean nothing; hereafter, the soul is new.
Those few, whose honor is confirmed, are good. ||3||
Pauree:
Only those whose karma You have pre-ordained from the very beginning, O Lord, meditate on You.
Nothing is in the power of these beings; You created the various worlds.
Some, You unite with Yourself, and some, You lead astray.
By Guru's Grace You are known; through Him, You reveal Yourself.
We are easily absorbed in You. ||11||
Shalok, First Mehl:
Suffering is the medicine, and pleasure the disease, because where there is pleasure, there is no desire for God.
You are the Creator Lord; I can do nothing. Even if I try, nothing happens. ||1||
I am a sacrifice to Your almighty creative power which is pervading everywhere.
Your limits cannot be known. ||1||Pause||
Your Light is in Your creatures, and Your creatures are in Your Light; Your almighty power is pervading everywhere.
You are the True Lord and Master; Your Praise is so beautiful. One who sings it, is carried across.
Nanak speaks the stories of the Creator Lord; whatever He is to do, He does. ||2||
Second Mehl:
The Way of Yoga is the Way of spiritual wisdom; the Vedas are the Way of the Brahmins.
The Way of the Khshatriya is the Way of bravery; the Way of the Shudras is service to others.
One who knows this secret that the Way of all is the Way of the One;
Nanak is a slave to him, he himself is the Immaculate Divine Lord. ||3||
Second Mehl:
The One Lord Krishna is the Divine Lord of all; He is the Divinity of the individual soul.
One who understands the mystery of all-pervading Lord;
Nanak is a slave to him; he himself is the Immaculate Divine Lord. ||4||
First Mehl:
Water remains confined within the pitcher, but without water, the pitcher could not have been formed;
just so, the mind is restrained by spiritual wisdom, but without the Guru, there is no spiritual wisdom. ||5||
Pauree:
If an educated person is a sinner, then the illiterate holy man is not to be punished.
As are the deeds done, so is the reputation one acquires.
So do not play such a game, which will bring you to ruin at the Court of the Lord.
The accounts of the educated and the illiterate shall be judged in the world hereafter.
One who stubbornly follows his own mind shall suffer in the world hereafter. ||12||
