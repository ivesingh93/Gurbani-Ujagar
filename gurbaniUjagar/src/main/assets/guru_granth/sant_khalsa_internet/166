O my Lord, I am so foolish; save me, O my Lord God!
Your servant's praise is Your Own Glorious Greatness. ||1||Pause||
Those whose minds are pleased by the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har, are joyful in the palaces of their own homes.
Their mouths savor all the sweet delicacies when they sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
The Lord's humble servants are the saviors of their families; they save their families for twenty-one generations - they save the entire world! ||2||
Whatever has been done, has been done by the Lord; it is the Glorious Greatness of the Lord.
O Lord, in Your creatures, You are pervading; You inspire them to worship You.
The Lord leads us to the treasure of devotional worship; He Himself bestows it. ||3||
I am a slave, purchased in Your market; what clever tricks do I have?
If the Lord were to set me upon a throne, I would still be His slave. If I were a grass-cutter, I would still chant the Lord's Name.

Gauree Bairaagan, Fourth Mehl:
The farmers love to work their farms;
they plow and work the fields, so that their sons and daughters may eat.
In just the same way, the Lord's humble servants chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and in the end, the Lord shall save them. ||1||
I am foolish - save me, O my Lord!
O Lord, enjoin me to work and serve the Guru, the True Guru. ||1||Pause||
The traders buy horses, planning to trade them.
They hope to earn wealth; their attachment to Maya increases.
In just the same way, the Lord's humble servants chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; chanting the Lord's Name, they find peace. ||2||
The shop-keepers collect poison, sitting in their shops, carrying on their business.
Their love is false, their displays are false, and they are engrossed in falsehood.
In just the same way, the Lord's humble servants gather the wealth of the Lord's Name; they take the Lord's Name as their supplies. ||3||
This emotional attachment to Maya and family, and the love of duality, is a noose around the neck.
Following the Guru's Teachings, the humble servants are carried across; they become the slaves of the Lord's slaves.
Servant Nanak meditates on the Naam; the Gurmukh is enlightened. ||4||3||9||47||
Gauree Bairaagan, Fourth Mehl:
Continuously, day and night, they are gripped by greed and deluded by doubt.
The slaves labor in slavery, carrying the loads upon their heads.
That humble being who serves the Guru is put to work by the Lord in His Home. ||1||
O my Lord, please break these bonds of Maya, and put me to work in Your Home.
I continuously sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord; I am absorbed in the Lord's Name. ||1||Pause||
Mortal men work for kings, all for the sake of wealth and Maya.
But the king either imprisons them, or fines them, or else dies himself.
Blessed, rewarding and fruitful is the service of the True Guru; through it, I chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and I have found peace. ||2||
Everyday, people carry on their business, with all sorts of devices to earn interest, for the sake of Maya.
If they earn a profit, they are pleased, but their hearts are broken by losses.
One who is worthy, becomes a partner with the Guru, and finds a lasting peace forever. ||3||
