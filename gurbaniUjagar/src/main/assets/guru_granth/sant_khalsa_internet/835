I praise the Lord, day and night, moving my feet to the beat of the drum. ||5||
Imbued with the Lord's Love, my mind sings His Praise, joyfully chanting the Shabad, the source of nectar and bliss.
The stream of immaculate purity flows through the home of the self within; one who drinks it in, finds peace. ||6||
The stubborn-minded, egotistical, proud-minded person performs rituals, but these are like sand castles built by children.
When the waves of the ocean come in, they crumble and dissolve in an instant. ||7||
The Lord is the pool, and the Lord Himself is the ocean; this world is all a play which He has staged.
As the waves of water merge into the water again, O Nanak, so does He merge into Himself. ||8||3||6||
Bilaaval, Fourth Mehl:
My mind wears the ear-rings of the True Guru's acquaintance; I apply the ashes of the Word of the Guru's Shabad to my body.
By body has become immortal, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. Both birth and death have come to an end for me. ||1||
O my mind, remain united with the Saadh Sangat.
Be merciful to me, O Lord; each and every instant, let me wash the Feet of the Holy. ||1||Pause||
Forsaking family life, he wanders in the forest, but his mind does not remain at rest, even for an instant.
The wandering mind returns home, only when it seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord's Holy people. ||2||
The Sannyaasi renounces his daughters and sons, but his mind still conjures up all sorts of hopes and desires.
With these hopes and desires, he still does not understand, that only through the Word of the Guru's Shabad does one become free of desires, and find peace. ||3||
When detachment from the world wells up within, he become a naked hermit, but still, his mind roams, wanders and rambles in the ten directions.
He wanders around, but his desires are not satisfied; joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, he finds the house of kindness and compassion. ||4||
The Siddhas learn many Yogis postures, but their minds still yearn for riches, miraculous powers and energy.
Satisfaction, contentment and tranquility do not come to their minds; but meeting the Holy Saints, they are satisfied, and through the Name of the Lord, spiritual perfection is attained. ||5||
Life is born from the egg, from the womb, from sweat and from the earth; God created the beings and creatures of all colors and forms.
One who seeks the Sanctuary of the Holy is saved, whether he is a Kshatriya, a Brahmin, a Soodra, a Vaisya or the most untouchable of the untouchables. ||6||
Naam Dayv, Jai Dayv, Kabeer, Trilochan and Ravi Daas the low-caste leather-worker,
blessed Dhanna and Sain; all those who joined the humble Saadh Sangat, met the Merciful Lord. ||7||
The Lord protects the honor of His humble servants; He is the Lover of His devotees - He makes them His own.
Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of the Lord, the Life of the world, who has showered His Mercy upon him, and saved him. ||8||||4||7||
Bilaaval, Fourth Mehl:
The thirst for God has welled up deep within me; hearing the Word of the Guru's Teachings, my mind is pierced by His arrow.
