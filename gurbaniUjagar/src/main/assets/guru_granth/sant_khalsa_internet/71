But still, if you do not come to remember the Supreme Lord God, then you shall be taken and consigned to the most hideous hell! ||7||
You may have a body free of disease and deformity, and have no worries or grief at all;
you may be unmindful of death, and night and day revel in pleasures;
you may take everything as your own, and have no fear in your mind at all;
but still, if you do not come to remember the Supreme Lord God, you shall fall under the power of the Messenger of Death. ||8||
The Supreme Lord showers His Mercy, and we find the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
The more time we spend there, the more we come to love the Lord.
The Lord is the Master of both worlds; there is no other place of rest.
When the True Guru is pleased and satisfied, O Nanak, the True Name is obtained. ||9||1||26||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl, Fifth House:
I do not know what pleases my Lord.
O mind, seek out the way! ||1||Pause||
The meditatives practice meditation,
and the wise practice spiritual wisdom,
but how rare are those who know God! ||1||
The worshipper of Bhagaauti practices self-discipline,
the Yogi speaks of liberation,
and the ascetic is absorbed in asceticism. ||2||
The men of silence observe silence,
the Sanyaasees observe celibacy,
and the Udaasees abide in detachment. ||3||
There are nine forms of devotional worship.
The Pandits recite the Vedas.
The householders assert their faith in family life. ||4||
Those who utter only One Word, those who take many forms, the naked renunciates,
the wearers of patched coats, the magicians, those who remain always awake,
and those who bathe at holy places of pilgrimage-||5||
Those who go without food, those who never touch others,
the hermits who never show themselves,
and those who are wise in their own minds-||6||
Of these, no one admits to any deficiency;
all say that they have found the Lord.
But he alone is a devotee, whom the Lord has united with Himself. ||7||
All devices and contrivances,
I have abondened and sought His Sanctuary.
Nanak has fallen at the Feet of the Guru. ||8||2||27||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Siree Raag, First Mehl, Third House:
Among Yogis, You are the Yogi;
among pleasure seekers, You are the Pleasure Seeker.
Your limits are not known to any of the beings in the heavens, in this world, or in the nether regions of the underworld. ||1||
I am devoted, dedicated, a sacrifice to Your Name. ||1||Pause||
You created the world,
and assigned tasks to one and all.
You watch over Your Creation, and through Your All-powerful Creative Potency, You cast the dice. ||2||
You are manifest in the Expanse of Your Workshop.
Everyone longs for Your Name,
but without the Guru, no one finds You. All are enticed and trapped by Maya. ||3||
I am a sacrifice to the True Guru.
Meeting Him, the supreme status is obtained.
