He alone is attached to the hem of the Lord's robe, whom the Lord Himself attaches.
Asleep for countless incarnations, he now awakens. ||3||
Your devotees belong to You, and You belong to Your devotees.
You Yourself inspire them to chant Your Praises.
All beings and creatures are in Your Hands.
Nanak's God is always with him. ||4||16||29||
Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the Inner-knower of my heart.
The Naam is so useful to me.
The Lord's Name permeates each and every hair of mine.
The Perfect True Guru has given me this gift. ||1||
The Jewel of the Naam is my treasure.
It is inaccessible, priceless, infinite and incomparable. ||1||Pause||
The Naam is my unmoving, unchanging Lord and Master.
The glory of the Naam spreads over the whole world.
The Naam is my perfect master of wealth.
The Naam is my independence. ||2||
The Naam is my food and love.
The Naam is the objective of my mind.
By the Grace of the Saints, I never forget the Naam.
Repeating the Naam, the Unstruck Sound-current of the Naad resounds. ||3||
By God's Grace, I have obtained the nine treasures of the Naam.
By Guru's Grace, I am tuned in to the Naam.
They alone are wealthy and supreme,
O Nanak, who have the treasure of the Naam. ||4||17||30||
Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
You are my Father, and You are my Mother.
You are my Soul, my Breath of Life, the Giver of Peace.
You are my Lord and Master; I am Your slave.
Without You, I have no one at all. ||1||
Please bless me with Your Mercy, God, and give me this gift,
that I may sing Your Praises, day and night. ||1||Pause||
I am Your musical instrument, and You are the Musician.
I am Your beggar; please bless me with Your charity, O Great Giver.
By Your Grace, I enjoy love and pleasures.
You are deep within each and every heart. ||2||
By Your Grace, I chant the Name.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I sing Your Glorious Praises.
In Your Mercy, You take away our pains.
By Your Mercy, the heart-lotus blossoms forth. ||3||
I am a sacrifice to the Divine Guru.
The Blessed Vision of His Darshan is fruitful and rewarding; His service is immaculate and pure.
Be Merciful to me, O my Lord God and Master,
that Nanak may continually sing Your Glorious Praises. ||4||18||31||
Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
His Regal Court is the highest of all.
I humbly bow to Him, forever and ever.
His place is the highest of the high.
Millions of sins are erased by the Name of the Lord. ||1||
In His Sanctuary, we find eternal peace.
He Mercifully unites us with Himself. ||1||Pause||
His wondrous actions cannot even be described.
All hearts rest their faith and hope in Him.
He is manifest in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
The devotees lovingly worship and adore Him night and day. ||2||
He gives, but His treasures are never exhausted.
In an instant, He establishes and disestablishes.
No one can erase the Hukam of His Command.
The True Lord is above the heads of kings. ||3||
He is my Anchor and Support; I place my hopes in Him.
