They are destroyed by Death's demons, and they must go to the City of Death. ||2||
The Gurmukhs are lovingly attached to the Lord, Har, Har, Har.
Their pains of both birth and death are taken away. ||3||
The Lord showers His Mercy on His humble devotees.
Guru Nanak has shown mercy to me; I have met the Lord, the Lord of the forest. ||4||2||
Basant Hindol, Fourth Mehl, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The Lord's Name is a jewel, hidden in a chamber of the palace of the body-fortress.
When one meets the True Guru, then he searches and finds it, and his light merges with the Divine Light. ||1||
O Lord, lead me to meet with the Holy Person, the Guru.
Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, all my sins are erased, and I obtain the supreme, sublime, sanctified status. ||1||Pause||
The five thieves join together and plunder the body-village, stealing the wealth of the Lord's Name.
But through the Guru's Teachings, they are traced and caught, and this wealth is recovered intact. ||2||
Practicing hypocrisy and superstition, people have grown weary of the effort, but still, deep within their hearts, they yearn for Maya, Maya.
By the Grace of the Holy Person, I have met with the Lord, the Primal Being, and the darkness of ignorance is dispelled. ||3||
The Lord, the Lord of the Earth, the Lord of the Universe, in His Mercy, leads me to meet the Holy Person, the Guru.
O Nanak, peace then comes to abide deep within my mind, and I constantly sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord within my heart. ||4||1||3||
Basant, Fourth Mehl, Hindol:
You are the Great Supreme Being, the Vast and Inaccessible Lord of the World; I am a mere insect, a worm created by You.
O Lord, Merciful to the meek, please grant Your Grace; O God, I long for the feet of the Guru, the True Guru. ||1||
O Dear Lord of the Universe, please be merciful and unite me with the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation.
I was overflowing with the filthy sins of countless past lives. But joining the Sangat, God made me pure again. ||1||Pause||
Your humble servant, whether of high class or low class, O Lord - by meditating on You, the sinner becomes pure.
The Lord exalts and elevates him above the whole world, and the Lord God blesses him with the Lord's Glory. ||2||
Anyone who meditates on God, whether of high class or low class, will have all of his hopes and desires fulfilled.
Those humble servants of the Lord who enshrine the Lord within their hearts, are blessed, and are made great and totally perfect. ||3||
I am so low, I am an utterly heavy lump of clay. Please shower Your Mercy on me, Lord, and unite me with Yourself.
The Lord, in His Mercy, has led servant Nanak to find the Guru; I was a sinner, and now I have become immaculate and pure. ||||4||2||4||
Basant Hindol, Fourth Mehl:
My mind cannot survive, even for an instant, without the Lord. I drink in continually the sublime essence of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
It is like a baby, who joyfully sucks at his mother's breast; when the breast is withdrawn, he weeps and cries. ||1||
O Dear Lord of the Universe, my mind and body are pierced through by the Name of the Lord.
By great good fortune, I have found the Guru, the True Guru, and in the body-village, the Lord has revealed Himself. ||1||Pause||
