when the True Guru shows His Kindness. ||2||
The house of ignorance, doubt and pain is destroyed,
for those within whose hearts the Guru's Feet abide. ||3||
In the Saadh Sangat, lovingly meditate on God.
Says Nanak, you shall obtain the Perfect Lord. ||4||4||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
Devotion is the natural quality of God's devotees.
Their bodies and minds are blended with their Lord and Master; He unites them with Himself. ||1||Pause||
The singer sings the songs,
but she alone is saved, within whose consciousness the Lord abides. ||1||
The one who sets the table sees the food,
but only one who eats the food is satisfied. ||2||
People disguise themselves with all sorts of costumes,
but in the end, they are seen as they truly are. ||3||
Speaking and talking are all just entanglements.
O slave Nanak, the true way of life is excellent. ||4||5||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
Your humble servant listens to Your Praises with delight. ||1||Pause||
My mind is enlightened, gazing upon the Glory of God. Wherever I look, there He is. ||1||
You are the farthest of all, the highest of the far, profound, unfathomable and unreachable. ||2||
You are united with Your devotees, through and through; You have removed Your veil for Your humble servants. ||3||
By Guru's Grace, Nanak sings Your Glorious Praises; he is intuitively absorbed in Samaadhi. ||4||6||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
I have come to the Saints to save myself. ||1||Pause||
Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of their Darshan, I am sanctified; they have implanted the Mantra of the Lord, Har, Har, within me. ||1||
The disease has been eradicated, and my mind has become immaculate. I have taken the healing medicine of the Lord, Har, Har. ||2||
I have become steady and stable, and I dwell in the home of peace. I shall never again wander anywhere. ||3||
By the Grace of the Saints, the people and all their generations are saved; O Nanak, they are not engrossed in Maya. ||4||7||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
I have totally forgotten my jealousy of others,
since I found the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||1||Pause||
No one is my enemy, and no one is a stranger. I get along with everyone. ||1||
Whatever God does, I accept that as good. This is the sublime wisdom I have obtained from the Holy. ||2||
The One God is pervading in all. Gazing upon Him, beholding Him, Nanak blossoms forth in happiness. ||3||8||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
O my Dear Lord and Master, You alone are my Support.
You are my Honor and Glory; I seek Your Support, and Your Sanctuary. ||1||Pause||
You are my Hope, and You are my Faith. I take Your Name and enshrine it within my heart.
You are my Power; associating with You, I am embellished and exalted. I do whatever You say. ||1||
Through Your Kindness and Compassion, I find peace; when You are Merciful, I cross over the terrifying world-ocean.
Through the Name of the Lord, I obtain the gift of fearlessness; Nanak places his head on the feet of the Saints. ||2||9||
