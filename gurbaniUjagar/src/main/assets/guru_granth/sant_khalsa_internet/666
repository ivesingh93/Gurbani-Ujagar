O Nanak, the Lord Himself sees all; He Himself links us to the Truth. ||4||7||
Dhanaasaree, Third Mehl:
The value and worth of the Lord's Name cannot be described.
Blessed are those humble beings, who lovingly focus their minds on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
True are the Guru's Teachings, and True is contemplative meditation.
God Himself forgives, and bestows contemplative meditation. ||1||
The Lord's Name is wonderful! God Himself imparts it.
In the Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Gurmukhs obtain it. ||1||Pause||
We are ignorant; ignorance fills our minds.
We do all our deeds in ego.
By Guru's Grace, egotism is eradicated.
Forgiving us, the Lord blends us with Himself. ||2||
Poisonous wealth gives rise to great arrogance.
Drowning in egotism, no one is honored.
Forsaking self-conceit, one finds lasting peace.
Under Guru's Instruction, he praises the True Lord. ||3||
The Creator Lord Himself fashions all.
Without Him, there is no other at all.
He alone is attached to Truth, whom the Lord Himself so attaches.
O Nanak, through the Naam, lasting peace is attained in the hereafter. ||4||8||
Raag Dhanaasaree, Third Mehl, Fourth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
I am just a poor beggar of Yours; You are Your Own Lord Master, You are the Great Giver.
Be Merciful, and bless me, a humble beggar, with Your Name, so that I may forever remain imbued with Your Love. ||1||
I am a sacrifice to Your Name, O True Lord.
The One Lord is the Cause of causes; there is no other at all. ||1||Pause||
I was wretched; I wandered through so many cycles of reincarnation. Now, Lord, please bless me with Your Grace.
Be merciful, and grant me the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan; please grant me such a gift. ||2||
Prays Nanak, the shutters of doubt have been opened wide; by Guru's Grace, I have come to know the Lord.
I am filled to overflowing with true love; my mind is pleased and appeased by the True Guru. ||3||1||9||
Dhanaasaree, Fourth Mehl, First House, Chau-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Those Saints and devotees who serve the Lord have all their sins washed away.
Have Mercy on me, O Lord and Master, and keep me in the Sangat, the Congregation that You love. ||1||
I cannot even speak the Praises of the Lord, the Gardener of the world.
We are sinners, sinking like stones in water; grant Your Grace, and carry us stones across. ||Pause||
The rust of poison and corruption from countless incarnations sticks to us; joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, it is cleaned away.
It is just like gold, which is heated in the fire, to remove the impurities from it. ||2||
I chant the chant of the Name of the Lord, day and night; I chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har, and enshrine it within my heart.
The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har, is the most perfect medicine in this world; chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, I have conquered my ego. ||3||
