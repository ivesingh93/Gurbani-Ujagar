Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, I live.
My karma is perfect, O my God. ||1||
Please, listen to this prayer, O my God.
Please bless me with Your Name, and make me Your chaylaa, Your disciple. ||1||Pause||
Please keep me under Your Protection, O God, O Great Giver.
By Guru's Grace, a few people understand this. ||2||
Please hear my prayer, O God, my Friend.
May Your Lotus Feet abide within my consciousness. ||3||
Nanak makes one prayer:
may I never forget You, O perfect treasure of virtue. ||4||18||24||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
He is my friend, companion, child, relative and sibling.
Wherever I look, I see the Lord as my companion and helper. ||1||
The Lord's Name is my social status, my honor and wealth.
He is my pleasure, poise, bliss and peace. ||1||Pause||
I have strapped on the armor of meditation on the Supreme Lord God.
It cannot be pierced, even by millions of weapons. ||2||
The Sanctuary of the Lord's Feet is my fortress and battlement.
The Messenger of Death, the torturer, cannot demolish it. ||3||
Slave Nanak is forever a sacrifice
to the selfless servants and Saints of the Sovereign Lord, the Destroyer of ego. ||4||19||25||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
Where the Glorious Praises of God, the Lord of the world are continually sung,
there is bliss, joy, happiness and peace. ||1||
Come, O my companions - let us go and enjoy God.
Let us fall at the feet of the holy, humble beings. ||1||Pause||
I pray for the dust of the feet of the humble.
It shall wash away the sins of countless incarnations. ||2||
I dedicate my mind, body, breath of life and soul to God.
Remembering the Lord in meditation, I have eradicated pride and emotional attachment. ||3||
O Lord, O Merciful to the meek, please give me faith and confidence,
so that slave Nanak may remain absorbed in Your Sanctuary. ||4||20||26||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
The city of heaven is where the Saints dwell.
They enshrine the Lotus Feet of God within their hearts. ||1||
Listen, O my mind and body, and let me show you the way to find peace,
so that you may eat and enjoy the various delicacies of the Lord||1||Pause||
Taste the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within your mind.
Its taste is wondrous - it cannot be described. ||2||
Your greed shall die, and your thirst shall be quenched.
The humble beings seek the Sanctuary of the Supreme Lord God. ||3||
The Lord dispels the fears and attachments of countless incarnations.
God has showered His Mercy and Grace upon slave Nanak. ||4||21||27||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
God covers the many shortcomings of His slaves.
Granting His Mercy, God makes them His own. ||1||
You emancipate Your humble servant,
and rescue him from the noose of the world, which is just a dream. ||1||Pause||
Even huge mountains of sin and corruption
are removed in an instant by the Merciful Lord. ||2||
Sorrow, disease and the most terrible calamities
are removed by meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||3||
Bestowing His Glance of Grace, He attaches us to the hem of His robe.
