He himself is drowning in the four Vedas; he drowns his disciples as well. ||104||
Kabeer, whatever sins the mortal has committed, he tries to keep hidden under cover.
But in the end, they shall all be revealed, when the Righteous Judge of Dharma investigates. ||105||
Kabeer, you have given up meditating on the Lord, and you have raised a large family.
You continue to involve yourself in worldly affairs, but none of your brothers and relatives remain. ||106||
Kabeer, those who give up meditation on the Lord, and get up at night to wake the spirits of the dead,
shall be reincarnated as snakes, and eat their own offspring. ||107||
Kabeer, the woman who gives up meditation on the Lord, and observes the ritual fast of Ahoi,
shall be reincarnated as a donkey, to carry heavy burdens. ||108||
Kabeer, it is the most clever wisdom, to chant and meditate on the Lord in the heart.
It is like playing on a pig; if you fall off, you will find no place of rest. ||109||
Kabeer, blessed is that mouth, which utters the Lord's Name.
It purifies the body, and the whole village as well. ||110||
Kabeer, that family is good, in which the Lord's slave is born.
But that family in which the Lord's slave is not born is as useless as weeds. ||111||
Kabeer, some have lots of horses, elephants and carriages, and thousands of banners waving.
But begging is better than these comforts, if one spends his days meditating in remembrance on the Lord. ||112||
Kabeer, I have wandered all over the world, carrying the drum on my shoulder.
No one belongs to anyone else; I have looked and carefully studied it. ||113||
The pearls are scattered on the road; the blind man comes along.
Without the Light of the Lord of the Universe, the world just passes them by. ||114||
My family is drowned, O Kabeer, since the birth of my son Kamaal.
He has given up meditating on the Lord, in order to bring home wealth. ||115||
Kabeer, go out to meet the holy man; do not take anyone else with you.
Do not turn back - keep on going. Whatever will be, will be. ||116||
Kabeer, do not bind yourself with that chain, which binds the whole world.
As the salt is lost in the flour, so shall your golden body be lost. ||117||
Kabeer, the soul-swan is flying away, and the body is being buried, and still he makes gestures.
Even then, the mortal does not give up the cruel look in his eyes. ||118||
Kabeer: with my eyes, I see You, Lord; with my ears, I hear Your Name.
With my tongue I chant Your Name; I enshrine Your Lotus Feet within my heart. ||119||
Kabeer, I have been spared from heaven and hell, by the Grace of the True Guru.
From beginning to end, I abide in the joy of the Lord's Lotus Feet. ||120||
Kabeer, how can I even describe the extent of the joy of the Lord's Lotus Feet?
I cannot describe its sublime glory; it has to be seen to be appreciated. ||121||
Kabeer, how can I describe what I have seen? No one will believe my words.
The Lord is just as He is. I dwell in delight, singing His Glorious Praises. ||122||
