Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
One who forgets the Lord's Name, suffers in pain.
Those who join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and dwell upon the Lord, find the Ocean of virtue. ||1||Pause||
Those Gurmukhs whose hearts are filled with wisdom,
hold the nine treasures, and the miraculous spiritual powers of the Siddhas in the palms of their hands. ||1||
Those who know the Lord God as their Master,
do not lack anything. ||2||
Those who realize the Creator Lord,
enjoy all peace and pleasure. ||3||
Those whose inner homes are filled with the Lord's wealth -
says Nanak, in their company, pain departs. ||4||9||147||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Your pride is so great, but what about your origins?
You cannot remain, no matter how much you try to hold on. ||1||Pause||
That which is forbidden by the Vedas and the Saints - with that, you are in love.
Like the gambler losing the game of chance, you are held in the power of sensory desires. ||1||
The One who is All-powerful to empty out and fill up - you have no love for His Lotus Feet.
O Nanak, I have been saved, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. I have been blessed by the Treasure of Mercy. ||2||10||148||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
I am the slave of my Lord and Master.
I eat whatever God gives me. ||1||Pause||
Such is my Lord and Master.
In an instant, He creates and embellishes. ||1||
I do that work which pleases my Lord and Master.
I sing the songs of God's glory, and His wondrous play. ||2||
I seek the Sanctuary of the Lord's Prime Minister;
beholding Him, my mind is comforted and consoled. ||3||
The One Lord is my support, the One is my steady anchor.
Servant Nanak is engaged in the Lord's work. ||4||11||149||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Is there anyone, who can shatter his ego,
and turn his mind away from this sweet Maya? ||1||Pause||
Humanity is in spiritual ignorance; people see things that do not exist.
The night is dark and gloomy; how will the morning dawn? ||1||
Wandering, wandering all around, I have grown weary; trying all sorts of things, I have been searching.
Says Nanak, He has shown mercy to me; I have found the treasure of the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||2||12||150||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
He is the Wish-fulfilling Jewel, the Embodiment of Mercy. ||1||Pause||
The Supreme Lord God is Merciful to the meek;
meditating in remembrance on Him, peace is obtained. ||1||
The Wisdom of the Undying Primal Being is beyond comprehension.
Hearing His Praises, millions of sins are erased. ||2||
O God, Treasure of Mercy, please bless Your kindness,
on Nanak, that he may repeat the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||3||13||151||
Gauree Poorbee, Fifth Mehl:
O my mind, in the Sanctuary of God, peace is found.
That day, when the Giver of life and peace is forgotten - that day passes uselessly. ||1||Pause||
You have come as a guest for one short night, and yet you hope to live for many ages.
Households, mansions and wealth - whatever is seen, is like the shade of a tree. ||1||
My body, wealth, and all my gardens and property shall all pass away.
You have forgotten your Lord and Master, the Great Giver. In an instant, these shall belong to somebody else. ||2||
