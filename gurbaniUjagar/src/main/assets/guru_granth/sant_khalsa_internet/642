His mind's desires may lead him to go and dwell at sacred places of pilgrimage, and offer his head to be sawn off;
but this will not cause the filth of his mind to depart, even though he may make thousands of efforts. ||3||
He may give gifts of all sorts - gold, women, horses and elephants.
He may make offerings of corn, clothes and land in abundance, but this will not lead him to the Lord's Door. ||4||
He may remain devoted to worship and adoration, bowing his forehead to the floor, practicing the six religious rituals.
He indulges in egotism and pride, and falls into entanglements, but he does not meet the Lord by these devices. ||5||
He practices the eighty-four postures of Yoga, and acquires the supernatural powers of the Siddhas, but he gets tired of practicing these.
He lives a long life, but is reincarnated again and again; he has not met with the Lord. ||6||
He may enjoy princely pleasures, and regal pomp and ceremony, and issue unchallenged commands.
He may lIE on beautiful beds, perfumed with sandalwood oil, but this will led him only to the gates of the most horrible hell. ||7||
Singing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is the highest of all actions.
Says Nanak, he alone obtains it, who is pre-destined to receive it. ||8||
Your slave is intoxicated with this Love of Yours.
The Destroyer of the pains of the poor has become merciful to me, and this mind is imbued with the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har. ||Second. Pause||1||3||
Vaar Of Raag Sorat'h, Fourth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Shalok, First Mehl:
Sorat'h is always beautiful, if it brings the True Lord to dwell in the mind of the soul-bride.
Her teeth are clean and her mind is not split by duality; the Name of the True Lord is on her tongue.
Here and hereafter, she abides in the Fear of God, and serves the True Guru without hesitation.
Discarding worldly adornments, she meets her Husband Lord, and she celebrates joyfully with Him.
She is adorned forever with the Name in her mind, and she does not have even an iota of filth.
Her husband's younger and elder brothers, the corrupt desires, have died, suffering in pain; and now, who fears Maya, the mother-in-law?
If she becomes pleasing to her Husband Lord, O Nanak, she bears the jewel of good karma upon her forehead, and everything is Truth to her. ||1||
Fourth Mehl:
Sorat'h is beautiful only when it leads the soul-bride to seek the Lord's Name.
She pleases her Guru and God; under Guru's Instruction, she speaks the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
She is attracted to the Lord's Name, day and night, and her body is drenched in the color of the Love of the Lord, Har, Har.
No other being like the Lord God can be found; I have looked and searched over the whole world.
The Guru, the True Guru, has implanted the Naam within me; my mind does not waver any more.
Servant Nanak is the Lord's slave, the slave of the slaves of the Guru, the True Guru. ||2||
Pauree:
You Yourself are the Creator, the Fashioner of the world.
You Yourself have arranged the play, and You Yourself arrange it.
You Yourself are the Giver and the Creator; You Yourself are the Enjoyer.
The Word of Your Shabad is pervading everywhere, O Creator Lord.
As Gurmukh, I ever praise the Lord; I am a sacrifice to the Guru. ||1||
