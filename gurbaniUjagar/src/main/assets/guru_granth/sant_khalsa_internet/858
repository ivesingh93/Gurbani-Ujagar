My pain is forgotten, and I have found peace deep within myself. ||1||
The Guru has blessed me with the ointment of spiritual wisdom.
Without the Lord's Name, life is mindless. ||1||Pause||
Meditating in remembrance, Naam Dayv has come to know the Lord.
His soul is blended with the Lord, the Life of the World. ||2||1||
Bilaaval, The Word Of Devotee Ravi Daas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Seeing my poverty, everyone laughed. Such was my condition.
Now, I hold the eighteen miraculous spiritual powers in the palm of my hand; everything is by Your Grace. ||1||
You know, and I am nothing, O Lord, Destroyer of fear.
All beings seek Your Sanctuary, O God, Fulfiller, Resolver of our affairs. ||1||Pause||
Whoever enters Your Sanctuary, is relieved of his burden of sin.
You have saved the high and the low from the shameless world. ||2||
Says Ravi Daas, what more can be said about the Unspoken Speech?
Whatever You are, You are, O Lord; how can anything compare with Your Praises? ||3||1||
Bilaaval:
That family, into which a holy person is born,
whether of high or low social class, whether rich or poor, shall have its pure fragrance spread all over the world. ||1||Pause||
Whether he is a Brahmin, a Vaisya, a Soodra, or a Kshatriya; whether he is a poet, an outcaste, or a filthy-minded person,
he becomes pure, by meditating on the Lord God. He saves himself, and the families of both his parents. ||1||
Blessed is that village, and blessed is the place of his birth; blessed is his pure family, throughout all the worlds.
One who drinks in the sublime essence abandons other tastes; intoxicated with this divine essence, he discards sin and corruption. ||2||
Among the religious scholars, warriors and kings, there is no other equal to the Lord's devotee.
As the leaves of the water lily float free in the water, says Ravi Daas, so is their life in the world. ||3||2||
The Word Of Sadhana, Raag Bilaaval:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
For a king's daughter, a man disguised himself as Vishnu.
He did it for sexual exploitation, and for selfish motives, but the Lord protected his honor. ||1||
What is Your value, O Guru of the world, if You will not erase the karma of my past actions?
Why seek safety from a lion, if one is to be eaten by a jackal? ||1||Pause||
For the sake of a single rain-drop, the rainbird suffers in pain.
When its breath of life is gone, even an ocean is of no use to it. ||2||
Now, my life has grown weary, and I shall not last much longer; how can I be patient?
If I drown and die, and then a boat comes along, tell me, how shall I climb aboard? ||3||
I am nothing, I have nothing, and nothing belongs to me.
Now, protect my honor; Sadhana is Your humble servant. ||4||1||
