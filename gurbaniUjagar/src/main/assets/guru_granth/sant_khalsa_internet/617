Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl, Second House, Du-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Fire is contained in all firewood, and butter is contained in all milk.
God's Light is contained in the high and the low; the Lord is in the hearts of all beings. ||1||
O Saints, He is pervading and permeating each and every heart.
The Perfect Lord is completely permeating everyone, everywhere; He is diffused in the water and the land. ||1||Pause||
Nanak sings the Praises of the Lord, the treasure of excellence; the True Guru has dispelled his doubt.
The Lord is pervading everywhere, permeating all, and yet, He is unattached from all. ||2||1||29||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
Meditating on Him, one is in ecstasy; the pains of birth and death and fear are removed.
The four cardinal blessings, and the nine treasures are received; you shall never feel hunger or thirst again. ||1||
Chanting His Name, you shall be at peace.
With each and every breath, meditate on the Lord and Master, O my soul, with mind, body and mouth. ||1||Pause||
You shall find peace, and your mind shall be soothed and cooled; the fire of desire shall not burn within you.
The Guru has revealed God to Nanak, in the three worlds, in the water, the earth and the woods. ||2||2||30||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
Sexual desire, anger, greed, falsehood and slander - please, save me from these, O Lord.
Please eradicate these from within me, and call me to come close to You. ||1||
You alone teach me Your Ways.
With the Lord's humble servants, I sing His Praises. ||1||Pause||
May I never forget the Lord within my heart; please, instill such understanding within my mind.
By great good fortune, servant Nanak has met with the Perfect Guru, and now, he will not go anywhere else. ||2||3||31||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
Meditating in remembrance on Him, all things are obtained, and one's efforts shall not be in vain.
Forsaking God, why do you attach yourself to another? He is contained in everything. ||1||
O Saints, meditate in remembrance on the World-Lord, Har, Har.
Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; your efforts shall be rewarded. ||1||Pause||
He ever preserves and cherishes His servant; with Love, He hugs him close.
Says Nanak, forgetting You, O God, how can the world find life? ||2||4||32||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
He is imperishable, the Giver of all beings; meditating on Him, all filth is removed.
He is the treasure of excellence, the object of His devotees, but rare are those who find Him. ||1||
O my mind, meditate on the Guru, and God, the Cherisher of the world.
Seeking His Sanctuary, one finds peace, and he shall not suffer in pain again. ||1||Pause||
By great good fortune, one obtains the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. Meeting them, evil-mindedness is eliminated.
