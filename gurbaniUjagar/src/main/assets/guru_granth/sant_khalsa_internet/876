Raamkalee, First Mehl, First House, Chau-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:
Some read the Sanskrit scriptures, and some read the Puraanas.
Some meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and chant it on their malas, focusing on it in meditation.
I know nothing, now or ever; I recognize only Your One Name, Lord. ||1||
I do not know, Lord, what my condition shall be.
I am foolish and ignorant; I seek Your Sanctuary, God. Please, save my honor and my self-respect. ||1||Pause||
Sometimes, the soul soars high in the heavens, and sometimes it falls to the depths of the nether regions.
The greedy soul does not remain stable; it searches in the four directions. ||2||
With death pre-ordained, the soul comes into the world, gathering the riches of life.
I see that some have already gone, O my Lord and Master; the burning fire is coming closer! ||3||
No one has any friend, and no one has any brother; no one has any father or mother.
Prays Nanak, if You bless me with Your Name, it shall be my help and support in the end. ||4||1||
Raamkalee, First Mehl:
Your Light is prevailing everywhere.
Wherever I look, there I see the Lord. ||1||
Please rid me of the desire to live, O my Lord and Master.
My mind is entangled in the deep dark pit of Maya. How can I cross over, O Lord and Master? ||1||Pause||
He dwells deep within, inside the heart; how can He not be outside as well?
Our Lord and Master always takes care of us, and keeps us in His thoughts. ||2||
He Himself is near at hand, and He is far away.
He Himself is all-pervading, permeating everywhere.
Meeting the True Guru, the darkness is dispelled.
