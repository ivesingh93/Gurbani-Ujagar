Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, search this cave.
The Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides deep within the self.
Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and decorate yourself with the Shabad. Meeting with your Beloved, you shall find peace. ||4||
The Messenger of Death imposes his tax on those who are attached to duality.
He inflicts punishment on those who forget the Name.
They are called to account for each instant and each moment. Every grain, every particle, is weighed and counted. ||5||
One who does not remember her Husband Lord in this world,
is being cheated by duality; she shall weep bitterly in the end.
She is from an evil family; she is ugly and vile. Even in her dreams, she does not meet her Husband Lord. ||6||
She who enshrines her Husband Lord in her mind in this world -
His Presence is revealed to her by the Perfect Guru.
That soul-bride keeps her Husband Lord clasped tightly to her heart, and through the Word of the Shabad, she enjoys her Husband Lord upon His Beautiful Bed. ||7||
The Lord Himself sends out the call, and He summons us to His Presence.
He enshrines His Name within our minds.
O Nanak, one who receives the greatness of the Naam night and day, constantly sings His Glorious Praises. ||8||28||29||
Maajh, Third Mehl:
Sublime is their birth, and the place where they dwell.
Those who serve the True Guru remain detached in the home of their own being.
They abide in the Lord's Love, and constantly imbued with His Love, their minds are satisfied and fulfilled with the Lord's Essence. ||1||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who read of the Lord, who understand and enshrine Him within their minds.
The Gurmukhs read and praise the Lord's Name; they are honored in the True Court. ||1||Pause||
The Unseen and Inscrutable Lord is permeating and pervading everywhere.
He cannot be obtained by any effort.
If the Lord grants His Grace, then we come to meet the True Guru. By His Kindness, we are united in His Union. ||2||
One who reads, while attached to duality, does not understand.
He yearns for the three-phased Maya.
The bonds of the three-phased Maya are broken by the Word of the Guru's Shabad. Through the Guru's Shabad, liberation is achieved. ||3||
This unstable mind cannot be held steady.
Attached to duality, it wanders in the ten directions.
It is a poisonous worm, drenched with poison, and in poison it rots away. ||4||
Practicing egotism and selfishness, they try to impress others by showing off.
They perform all sorts of rituals, but they gain no acceptance.
Without You, Lord, nothing happens at all. You forgive those who are adorned with the Word of Your Shabad. ||5||
They are born, and they die, but they do not understand the Lord.
Night and day, they wander, in love with duality.
The lives of the self-willed manmukhs are useless; in the end, they die, regretting and repenting. ||6||
The Husband is away, and the wife is getting dressed up.
This is what the blind, self-willed manmukhs are doing.
They are not honored in this world, and they shall find no shelter in the world hereafter. They are wasting their lives in vain. ||7||
How rare are those who know the Name of the Lord!
Through the Shabad, the Word of the Perfect Guru, the Lord is realized.
Night and day, they perform the Lord's devotional service; day and night, they find intuitive peace. ||8||
That One Lord is pervading in all.
Only a few, as Gurmukh, understand this.
O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Naam are beautiful. Granting His Grace, God unites them with Himself. ||9||29||30||
