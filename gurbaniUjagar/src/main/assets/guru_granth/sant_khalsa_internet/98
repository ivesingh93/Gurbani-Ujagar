Her marriage is eternal; her Husband is Inaccessible and Incomprehensible. O Servant Nanak, His Love is her only Support. ||4||4||11||
Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
I have searched and searched, seeking the Blessed Vision of His Darshan.
I traveled through all sorts of woods and forests.
My Lord, Har, Har, is both absolute and related, unmanifest and manifest; is there anyone who can come and unite me with Him? ||1||
People recite from memory the wisdom of the six schools of philosophy;
they perform worship services, wear ceremonial religious marks on their foreheads, and take ritual cleansing baths at sacred shrines of pilgrimage.
They perform the inner cleansing practice with water and adopt the eighty-four Yogic postures; but still, they find no peace in any of these. ||2||
They chant and meditate, practicing austere self-discipline for years and years;
they wander on journeys all over the earth;
and yet, their hearts are not at peace, even for an instant. The Yogi rises up and goes out, over and over again. ||3||
By His Mercy, I have met the Holy Saint.
My mind and body have been cooled and soothed; I have been blessed with patience and composure.
The Immortal Lord God has come to dwell within my heart. Nanak sings the songs of joy to the Lord. ||4||5||12||
Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
The Supreme Lord God is Infinite and Divine;
He is Inaccessible, Incomprehensible, Invisible and Inscrutable.
Merciful to the meek, Sustainer of the World, Lord of the Universe-meditating on the Lord, the Gurmukhs find salvation. ||1||
The Gurmukhs are emancipated by the Lord.
The Lord Krishna becomes the Gurmukh's Companion.
The Gurmukh finds the Merciful Lord. He is not found any other way. ||2||
He does not need to eat; His Hair is Wondrous and Beautiful; He is free of hate.
Millions of people worship His Feet.
He alone is a devotee, who becomes Gurmukh, whose heart is filled with the Lord, Har, Har. ||3||
Forever fruitful is the Blessed Vision of His Darshan; He is Infinite and Incomparable.
He is Awesome and All-powerful; He is forever the Great Giver.
As Gurmukh, chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and you shall be carried across. O Nanak, rare are those who know this state! ||4||6||13||
Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
As You command, I obey; as You give, I receive.
You are the Pride of the meek and the poor.
You are everything; You are my Beloved. I am a sacrifice to Your Creative Power. ||1||
By Your Will, we wander in the wilderness; by Your Will, we find the path.
By Your Will, we become Gurmukh and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
By Your Will, we wander in doubt through countless lifetimes. Everything happens by Your Will. ||2||
No one is foolish, and no one is clever.
Your Will determines everything;
You are Inaccessible, Incomprehensible, Infinite and Unfathomable. Your Value cannot be expressed. ||3||
Please bless me with the dust of the Saints, O my Beloved.
I have come and fallen at Your Door, O Lord.
Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, my mind is fulfilled. O Nanak, with natural ease, I merge into Him. ||4||7||14||
Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
They forget the Lord, and they suffer in pain.
Afflicted with hunger, they run around in all directions.
Meditating in remembrance on the Naam, they are happy forever. The Lord, Merciful to the meek, bestows it upon them. ||1||
My True Guru is absolutely All-powerful.
