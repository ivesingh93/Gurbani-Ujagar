Know the state of your inner being; meet with the Guru and get rid of your skepticism.
To reach your True Home after you die, you must conquer death while you are still alive.
The beautiful, Unstruck Sound of the Shabad is obtained, contemplating the Guru. ||2||
The Unstruck Melody of Gurbani is obtained, and egotism is eliminated.
I am forever a sacrifice to those who serve their True Guru.
They are dressed in robes of honor in the Court of the Lord; the Name of the Lord is on their lips. ||3||
Wherever I look, I see the Lord pervading there, in the union of Shiva and Shakti, of consciousness and matter.
The three qualities hold the body in bondage; whoever comes into the world is subject to their play.
Those who separate themselves from the Lord wander lost in misery. The self-willed manmukhs do not attain union with Him. ||4||
If the mind becomes balanced and detached, and comes to dwell in its own true home, imbued with the Fear of God,
then it enjoys the essence of supreme spiritual wisdom; it shall never feel hunger again.
O Nanak, conquer and subdue this mind; meet with the Lord, and you shall never again suffer in pain. ||5||18||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
This foolish mind is greedy; through greed, it becomes even more attached to greed.
The evil-minded shaaktas, the faithless cynics, are not attuned to the Shabad; they come and go in reincarnation.
One who meets with the Holy True Guru finds the Treasure of Excellence. ||1||
O mind, renounce your egotistical pride.
Serve the Lord, the Guru, the Sacred Pool, and you shall be honored in the Court of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Chant the Name of the Lord day and night; become Gurmukh, and know the Wealth of the Lord.
All comforts and peace, and the Essence of the Lord, are enjoyed by acquiring spiritual wisdom in the Society of the Saints.
Day and night, continually serve the Lord God; the True Guru has given the Naam. ||2||
Those who practice falsehood are dogs; those who slander the Guru shall burn in their own fire.
They wander lost and confused, deceived by doubt, suffering in terrible pain. The Messenger of Death shall beat them to a pulp.
The self-willed manmukhs find no peace, while the Gurmukhs are wondrously joyful. ||3||
In this world, people are engrossed in false pursuits, but in the world hereafter, only the account of your true actions is accepted.
The Guru serves the Lord, His Intimate Friend. The Guru's actions are supremely exalted.
O Nanak, never forget the Naam, the Name of the Lord; the True Lord shall bless you with His Mark of Grace. ||4||19||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
Forgetting the Beloved, even for a moment, the mind is afflicted with terrible diseases.
How can honor be attained in His Court, if the Lord does not dwell in the mind?
Meeting with the Guru, peace is found. The fire is extinguished in His Glorious Praises. ||1||
O mind, enshrine the Praises of the Lord, day and night.
One who does not forget the Naam, for a moment or even an instant-how rare is such a person in this world! ||1||Pause||
When one's light merges into the Light, and one's intuitive consciousness is joined with the Intuitive Consciousness,
then one's cruel and violent instincts and egotism depart, and skepticism and sorrow are taken away.
The Lord abides within the mind of the Gurmukh, who merges in the Lord's Union, through the Guru. ||2||
If I surrender my body like a bride, the Enjoyer will enjoy me.
Do not make love with one who is just a passing show.
The Gurmukh is ravished like the pure and happy bride on the Bed of God, her Husband. ||3||
