Raag Kaydaaraa, The Word Of Kabeer Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Those who ignore both praise and slander, who reject egotistical pride and conceit,
who look alike upon iron and gold - they are the very image of the Lord God. ||1||
Hardly anyone is a humble servant of Yours, O Lord.
Ignoring sexual desire, anger, greed and attachment, such a person becomes aware of the Lord's Feet. ||1||Pause||
Raajas, the quality of energy and activity; Taamas, the quality of darkness and inertia; and Satvas, the quality of purity and light, are all called the creations of Maya, Your illusion.
That man who realizes the fourth state - he alone obtains the supreme state. ||2||
Amidst pilgrimages, fasting, rituals, purification and self-discipline, he remains always without thought of reward.
Thirst and desire for Maya and doubt depart, remembering the Lord, the Supreme Soul. ||3||
When the temple is illuminated by the lamp, its darkness is dispelled.
The Fearless Lord is All-pervading. Doubt has run away, says Kabeer, the Lord's humble slave. ||4||1||
Some deal in bronze and copper, some in cloves and betel nuts.
The Saints deal in the Naam, the Name of the Lord of the Universe. Such is my merchandise as well. ||1||
I am a trader in the Name of the Lord.
The priceless diamond has come into my hands. I have left the world behind. ||1||Pause||
When the True Lord attached me, then I was attached to Truth. I am a trader of the True Lord.
I have loaded the commodity of Truth; It has reached the Lord, the Treasurer. ||2||
He Himself is the pearl, the jewel, the ruby; He Himself is the jeweler.
He Himself spreads out in the ten directions. The Merchant is Eternal and Unchanging. ||3||
My mind is the bull, and meditation is the road; I have filled my packs with spiritual wisdom, and loaded them on the bull.
Says Kabeer, listen, O Saints: my merchandise has reached its destination! ||4||2||
You barbaric brute, with your primitive intellect - reverse your breath and turn it inward.
Let your mind be intoxicated with the stream of Ambrosial Nectar which trickles down from the furnace of the Tenth Gate. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, call on the Lord.
O Saints, drink in this wine forever; it is so difficult to obtain, and it quenches your thirst so easily. ||1||Pause||
In the Fear of God, is the Love of God. Only those few who understand His Love obtain the sublime essence of the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny.
As many hearts as there are - in all of them, is His Ambrosial Nectar; as He pleases, He causes them to drink it in. ||2||
There are nine gates to the one city of the body; restrain your mind from escaping through them.
When the knot of the three qualities is untied, then the Tenth Gate opens up, and the mind is intoxicated, O Siblings of Destiny. ||3||
When the mortal fully realizes the state of fearless dignity, then his sufferings vanish; so says Kabeer after careful deliberation.
Turning away from the world, I have obtained this wine, and I am intoxicated with it. ||4||3||
You are engrossed with unsatisfied sexual desire and unresolved anger; you do not know the State of the One Lord.
Your eyes are blinded, and you see nothing at all. You drown and dIE without water. ||1||
