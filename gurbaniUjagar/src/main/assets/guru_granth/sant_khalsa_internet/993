Raag Maaroo, First Mehl, Fifth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Day and night, he remains awake and aware; he never sleeps or dreams.
He alone knows this, who feels the pain of separation from God.
My body is pierced through with the arrow of love. How can any physician know the cure? ||1||
Whom the True Lord links to His Praise,
that rare one, as Gurmukh, understands.
He alone appreciates the value of the Ambrosial Nectar, who deals in this Ambrosia. ||1||Pause||
The soul-bride is in love with her Husband Lord;
the focuses her consciousness on the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
The soul-bride is joyously embellished with intuitive ease; her hunger and thirst are taken away. ||2||
Tear down skepticism and dispel your doubt;
with your intuition, draw the bow of the Praise of the Lord.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, conquer and subdue your mind; take the support of Yoga - Union with the beautiful Lord. ||3||
Burnt by egotism, one forgets the Lord from his mind.
In the City of Death, he is attacked with massive swords.
Then, even if he asks for it, he will not receive the Lord's Name; O soul, you shall suffer terrible punishment. ||4||
You are distracted by thoughts of Maya and worldly attachment.
In the City of Death, you will be caught by the noose of the Messenger of Death.
You cannot break free from the bondage of loving attachment, and so the Messenger of Death will torture you. ||5||
I have done nothing; I am doing nothing now.
The True Guru has blessed me with the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam.
What other efforts can anyone make, when You bestow Your blessing? Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary. ||6||1||12||
Maaroo, Third Mehl, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Wherever You seat me, there I sit, O my Lord and Master; wherever You send me, there I go.
In the entire village, there is only One King; all places are sacred. ||1||
O Baba, while I dwell in this body, let me sing Your True Praises,
that I may intuitively merge with You. ||1||Pause||
He thinks that good and bad deeds come from himself; this is the source of all evil.
Whatever happens in this world is only by the Order of our Lord and Master. ||2||
Sexual desires are so strong and compelling; where has this sexual desire come from?
The Creator Himself stages all the plays; how rare are those who realize this. ||3||
By Guru's Grace, one is lovingly focused on the One Lord, and then, duality is ended.
Whatever is in harmony with His Will, he accepts as True; the noose of Death is loosened from around his neck. ||4||
Prays Nanak, who can call him to account, when the egotistical pride of his mind has been silenced?
Even the Righteous Judge of Dharma is intimidated and afraid of him; he has entered the Sanctuary of the True Lord. ||5||1||
Maaroo, Third Mehl:
Coming and going in reincarnation no longer exist, when one dwells in the home of the self within.
He bestowed the Blessing of His treasure of truth; only He Himself knows. ||1||
