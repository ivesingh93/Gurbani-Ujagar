He comes when the Lord sends him; when the Lord calls him back, he goes.
Whatever he does, the Lord is doing. The Forgiving Lord forgives him. ||10||
I seek to be with those who have tasted this sublime essence of the Lord.
Wealth, miraculous spiritual powers, wisdom and spiritual knowledge, are obtained from the Guru. The treasure of liberation is obtained in His Sanctuary. ||11||
The Gurmukh looks upon pain and pleasure as one and the same; he remains untouched by joy and sorrow.
Conquering his self-conceit, the Gurmukh finds the Lord; O Nanak, he intuitively merges into the Lord. ||12||7||
Raamkalee, Dakhanee, First Mehl:
Abstinence, chastity, self-control and truthfulness have been implanted within me; I am imbued with the sublime essence of the True Word of the Shabad. ||1||
My Merciful Guru remains forever imbued with the Lord's Love.
Day and night, He remains lovingly focused on the One Lord; gazing upon the True Lord, He is pleased. ||1||Pause||
He abides in the Tenth Gate, and looks equally upon all; He is imbued with the unstruck sound current of the Shabad. ||2||
Wearing the loin-cloth of chastity, He remains absorbed in the all-pervading Lord; His tongue enjoys the taste of God's Love. ||3||
The One who created the creation has met the True Guru; contemplating the Guru's lifestyle, He is pleased. ||4||
All are in the One, and the One is in all. This is what the True Guru has shown me. ||5||
He who created the worlds, solar systems and galaxies - that God cannot be known. ||6||
From the lamp of God, the lamp within is lit; the Divine Light illuminates the three worlds. ||7||
The Guru sits on the true throne in the true mansion; He is attuned, absorbed in the Fearless Lord. ||8||
The Guru, the detached Yogi, has enticed the hearts of all; He plays His harp in each and every heart. ||9||
O Nanak, in God's Sanctuary, one is emancipated; the True Guru becomes our true help and support. ||10||8||
Raamkalee, First Mehl:
He has made His home in the monastery of the heart; He has infused His power into the earth and the sky. ||1||
Through the Word of the Shabad, the Gurmukhs have saved so very many, O Saints. ||1||Pause||
He conquers attachment, and eradicates egotism, and sees Your Divine Light pervading the three worlds, Lord. ||2||
He conquers desire, and enshrines the Lord within his mind; he contemplates the Word of the True Guru's Shabad. ||3||
The horn of consciousness vibrates the unstruck sound current; Your Light illuminates each and every heart, Lord. ||4||
He plays the flute of the universe in his mind, and lights the fire of God. ||5||
Bringing together the five elements, day and night, the Lord's lamp shines with the Immaculate Light of the Infinite. ||6||
The right and left nostrils, the sun and the moon channels, are the strings of the body-harp; they vibrate the wondrous melody of the Shabad. ||7||
The true hermit obtains a seat in the City of God, the invisible, inaccessible, infinite. ||8||
The mind is the king of the city of the body; the five sources of knowledge dwell within it. ||9||
Seated in his home, this king chants the Shabad; he administers justice and virtue. ||10||
What can poor death or birth say to him? Conquering his mind, he remains dead while yet alive. ||11||
