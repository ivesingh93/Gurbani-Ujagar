The power of Maya is pervading everywhere.
Her secret is known only by Guru's Grace - no one else knows it. ||1||Pause||
Conquering and conquering, she has conquered everywhere, and she clings to the whole world.
Says Nanak, she surrenders to the Holy Saint; becoming his servant, she falls at his feet. ||2||5||14||
Goojaree, Fifth Mehl:
With my palms pressed together, I offer my prayer, meditating on my Lord and Master.
Giving me His hand, the Transcendent Lord has saved me, and erased all my sins. ||1||
The Lord and Master Himself has become merciful.
I have been emancipated, the embodiment of bliss; I am the child of the Lord of the Universe - He has carried me across. ||1||Pause||
Meeting her Husband, the soul-bride sings the songs of joy, and celebrates her Lord and Master.
Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to the Guru, who has emancipated everyone. ||2||6||15||
Goojaree, Fifth Mehl:
Mother, father, siblings, children and relatives - their power is insignificant.
I have seen the many pleasures of Maya, but none goes with them in the end. ||1||
O Lord Master, other than You, no one is mine.
I am a worthless orphan, devoid of merit; I long for Your Support. ||1||Pause||
I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice to Your lotus feet; here and hereafter, Yours is the only power.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, Nanak has obtained the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan; my obligations to all others are annulled. ||2||7||16||
Goojaree, Fifth Mehl:
He rids us of entanglements, doubt and emotional attachment, and leads us to love God.
He implants this instruction in our minds, for us to sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, in peace and poise. ||1||
O friend, the Saintly Guru is such a helper.
Meeting Him, the bonds of Maya are released, and one never forgets the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Practicing, practicing various actions in so many ways, I came to recognize this as the best way.
Joining the Company of the Holy, Nanak sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and crosses over the terrifying world-ocean. ||2||8||17||
Goojaree, Fifth Mehl:
In an instant, He establishes and disestablishes; His value cannot be described.
He turns the king into a beggar in an instant, and He infuses splendor into the lowly. ||1||
Meditate forever on Your Lord.
Why should I feel worry or anxiety, when I am here for only a short time. ||1||Pause||
You are my support, O my Perfect True Guru; my mind has taken to the protection of Your Sanctuary.
Nanak, I am a foolish and ignorant child; reach out to me with Your hand, Lord, and save me. ||2||9||18||
Goojaree, Fifth Mehl:
You are the Giver of all beings; please, come to dwell within my mind.
That heart, within which Your lotus feet are enshrined, suffers no darkness or doubt. ||1||
O Lord Master, wherever I remember You, there I find You.
Show Mercy to me, O God, Cherisher of all, that I may sing Your Praises forever. ||1||Pause||
With each and every breath, I contemplate Your Name; O God, I long for You alone.
O Nanak, my support is the Creator Lord; I have renounced all other hopes. ||2||10||19||
