I am a sacrifice to one who sees, and inspires others to see Him.
By Guru's Grace, I have obtained the supreme status. ||1||
Whose Name should I chant, and meditate on, except the Lord of the Universe?
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Mansion of the Lord's Presence is revealed within the home of one's own heart. ||1||Pause||
The Second Day: Those who are in love with another, come to regret and repent.
The are tied up at Death's door, and continue coming and going.
What have they brought, and what will they take with them when they go?
The Messenger of Death looms over their heads, and they endure his beating.
Without the Word of the Guru's Shabad, no one finds release.
Practicing hypocrisy, no one finds liberation. ||2||
The True Lord Himself created the universe, joining the elements together.
Breaking the cosmic egg, He united, and separated.
He made the earth and the sky into places to live.
He created day and night, fear and love.
The One who created the Creation, also watches over it.
There is no other Creator Lord. ||3||
The Third Day: He created Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva,
the gods, goddesses and various manifestations.
The lights and forms cannot be counted.
The One who fashioned them, knows their value.
He evaluates them, and totally pervades them.
Who is close, and who is far away? ||4||
The Fourth Day: He created the four Vedas,
the four sources of creation, and distinct forms of speech.
He created the eighteen Puraanas, the six Shaastras and the three qualities.
He alone understands, whom the Lord causes to understand.
One who overcomes the three qualities, dwells in the fourth state.
Prays Nanak, I am his slave. ||5||
The Fifth Day: The five elements are demons.
The Lord Himself is unfathomable and detached.
Some are gripped by doubt, hunger, emotional attachment and desire.
Some taste the sublime essence of the Shabad, and are satisfied.
Some are imbued with the Lord's Love, while some die, and are reduced to dust.
Some attain the Court and the Mansion of the True Lord, and behold Him, ever-present. ||6||
The false one has no honor or fame;
like the black crow, he never becomes pure.
He is like the bird, imprisoned in a cage;
he paces back and forth behind the bars, but he is not released.
He alone is emancipated, whom the Lord and Master emancipates.
He follows the Guru's Teachings, and enshrines devotional worship. ||7||
The Sixth Day: God organized the six systems of Yoga.
The unstruck sound current of the Shabad vibrates of itself.
If God wills it so, then one is summoned to the Mansion of His Presence.
One who is pierced through by the Shabad, obtains honor.
Those who wear religious robes burn, and are ruined.
Through Truth, the truthful ones merge into the True Lord. ||8||
The Seventh Day: When the body is imbued with Truth and contentment,
the seven seas within are filled with the Immaculate Water.
Bathing in good conduct, and contemplating the True Lord within the heart,
one obtains the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and carries everyone across.
With the True Lord in the mind, and the True Lord lovingly on one's lips,
one is blessed with the banner of Truth, and meets with no obstructions. ||9||
The Eighth Day: The eight miraculous powers come when one subdues his own mind,
and contemplates the True Lord through pure actions.
Forget the three qualities of wind, water and fire,
and concentrate on the pure True Name.
That human who remains lovingly focused on the Lord,
prays Nanak, shall not be consumed by death. ||10||
The Ninth Day: the nine masters of Yoga, the nine realms of the earth,
and each and every heart, the Name is the supreme almighty Master.
