Why do you walk in that crooked, zigzag way?
You are nothing more than a bundle of bones, wrapped in skin, filled with manure; you give off such a rotten smell! ||1||Pause||
You do not meditate on the Lord. What doubts have confused and deluded you? Death is not far away from you!
Making all sorts of efforts, you manage to preserve this body, but it shall only survive until its time is up. ||2||
By one's own efforts, nothing is done. What can the mere mortal accomplish?
When it pleases the Lord, the mortal meets the True Guru, and chants the Name of the One Lord. ||3||
You live in a house of sand, but you still puff up your body - you ignorant fool!
Says Kabeer, those who do not remember the Lord may be very clever, but they still drown. ||4||4||
Your turban is crooked, and you walk crooked; and now you have started chewing betel leaves.
You have no use at all for loving devotional worship; you say you have business in court. ||1||
In your egotistical pride, you have forgotten the Lord.
Gazing upon your gold, and your very beautiful wife, you believe that they are permanent. ||1||Pause||
You are engrossed in greed, falsehood, corruption and great arrogance. Your life is passing away.
Says Kabeer, at the very last moment, death will come and seize you, you fool! ||2||5||
The mortal beats the drum for a few days, and then he must depart.
With so much wealth and cash and buried treasure, still, he cannot take anything with him. ||1||Pause||
Sitting on the threshold, his wife weeps and wails; his mother accompanies him to the outer gate.
All the people and relatives together go to the crematorium, but the swan-soul must go home all alone. ||1||
Those children, that wealth, that city and town - he shall not come to see them again.
Says Kabeer, why do you not meditate on the Lord? Your life is uselessly slipping away! ||2||6||
Raag Kaydaaraa, The Word Of Ravi Daas Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
One who performs the six religious rituals and comes from a good family, but who does not have devotion to the Lord in his heart,
one who does not appreciate talk of the Lord's Lotus Feet, is just like an outcaste, a pariah. ||1||
Be conscious, be conscious, be conscious, O my unconscious mind.
Why do you not look at Baalmeek?
From such a low social status, what a high status he obtained! Devotional worship to the Lord is sublime! ||1||Pause||
The killer of dogs, the lowest of all, was lovingly embraced by Krishna.
See how the poor people praise him! His praise extends throughout the three worlds. ||2||
Ajaamal, Pingulaa, Lodhia and the elephant went to the Lord.
Even such evil-minded beings were emancipated. Why should you not also be saved, O Ravi Daas? ||3||1||
