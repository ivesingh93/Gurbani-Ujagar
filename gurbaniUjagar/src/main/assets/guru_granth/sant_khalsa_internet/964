Pauree:
When I forget You, I endure all pains and afflictions.
Making thousands of efforts, they are still not eliminated.
One who forgets the Name, is known as a poor person.
One who forgets the Name, wanders in reincarnation.
One who does not remember his Lord and Master, is punished by the Messenger of Death.
One who does not remember his Lord and Master, is judged to be a sick person.
One who does not remember his Lord and Master, is egotistical and proud.
One who forgets the Name is miserable in this world. ||14||

Fifth Mehl:
Beautiful are those feet which walk towards You; beautiful is that head which falls at Your Feet.

Pauree:
Meeting the Lord's brides, in the True Congregation, I sing the songs of joy.
The home of my heart is now held steady, and I shall not go out wandering again.
Evil-mindedness has been dispelled, along with sin and my bad reputation.

Inwardly and outwardly, the One and only Lord is my way.
My mind is thirsty for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. I am a slave at His feet.
I am glorified and embellished, when my Lord and Master enjoys me.
I meet Him through my blessed destiny, when it is pleasing to His Will. ||15||
Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
All virtues are Yours, Dear Lord; You bestow them upon us. I am unworthy - what can I achieve, O Nanak?
There is no other Giver as great as You. I am a beggar; I beg from You forever. ||1||

My body was wasting away, and I was depressed. The Guru, my Friend, has encouraged and consoled me.
I sleep in total peace and comfort; I have conquered the whole world. ||2||
Pauree:
The Darbaar of Your Court is glorious and great. Your holy throne is True.
You are the Emperor over the heads of kings. Your canopy and chauree (fly-brush) are permanent and unchanging.
That alone is true justice, which is pleasing to the Will of the Supreme Lord God.
Even the homeless receive a home, when it is pleasing to the Will of the Supreme Lord God.
Whatever the Creator Lord does, is a good thing.
Those who recognize their Lord and Master, are seated in the Court of the Lord.
True is Your Command; no one can challenge it.
O Merciful Lord, Cause of causes, Your creative power is all-powerful. ||16||

I have found the jewel within my heart.
I was not charged for it; the True Guru gave it to me.
My search has ended, and I have become stable.
O Nanak, I have conquered this priceless human life. ||2||

One who has such good karma inscribed upon his forehead, is committed to the Lord's service.
One whose heart lotus blossoms forth upon meeting the Guru, remains awake and aware, night and day.
All doubt and fear run away from one who is in love with the Lord's lotus feet.
