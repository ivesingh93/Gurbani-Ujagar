Is there any such Saint, who would meet with me, take away my anxiety, and lead me to enshrine love for my Lord and Master. ||2||
I have read all the Vedas, and yet the sense of separation in my mind still has not been removed; the five thieves of my house are not quieted, even for an instant.
Is there any devotee, who is unattached to Maya, who may irrigate my mind with the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the One Lord? ||3||
In spite of the many places of pilgrimage for people to bathe in, their minds are still stained by their stubborn ego; the Lord Master is not pleased by this at all.
When will I find the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy? There, I shall be always in the ecstasy of the Lord, Har, Har, and my mind shall take its cleansing bath in the healing ointment of spiritual wisdom. ||4||
I have followed the four stages of life, but my mind is not satisfied; I wash my body, but it is totally lacking in understanding.
If only I could meet some devotee of the Supreme Lord God, imbued with the Lord's Love, who could eradicate the filthy evil-mindedness from my mind. ||5||
One who is attached to religious rituals, does not love the Lord, even for an instant; he is filled with pride, and he is of no account.
One who meets with the rewarding personality of the Guru, continually sings the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises. By Guru's Grace, such a rare one beholds the Lord with his eyes. ||6||
One who acts through stubbornness is of no account at all; like a crane, he pretends to meditate, but he is still stuck in Maya.
Is there any such Giver of peace, who can recite to me the sermon of God? Meeting him, I would be emancipated. ||7||
When the Lord, my King, is totally pleased with me, He will break the bonds of Maya for me; my mind is imbued with the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
I am in ecstasy, forever and ever, meeting the Fearless Lord, the Lord of the Universe. Falling at the Lord's Feet, Nanak has found peace. ||8||
My Yatra, my life pilgrimage, has become fruitful, fruitful, fruitful.
My comings and goings have ended, since I met the Holy Saint. ||1||Second. Pause||1||3||
Dhanaasaree, First Mehl, Chhant:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Why should I bathe at sacred shrines of pilgrimage? The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the sacred shrine of pilgrimage.
My sacred shrine of pilgrimage is spiritual wisdom within, and contemplation on the Word of the Shabad.
The spiritual wisdom given by the Guru is the True sacred shrine of pilgrimage, where the ten festivals are always observed.
I constantly beg for the Name of the Lord; grant it to me, O God, Sustainer of the world.
The world is sick, and the Naam is the medicine to cure it; without the True Lord, filth sticks to it.
The Guru's Word is immaculate and pure; it radiates a steady Light. Constantly bathe in such a true shrine of pilgrimage. ||1||
Filth does not stick to the true ones; what filth do they have to wash off?
If one strings a garland of virtues for oneself, what is there to cry for?
One who conquers his own self through contemplation is saved, and saves others as well; he does not come to be born again.
The supreme meditator is Himself the philosopher's stone, which transforms lead into gold. The true man is pleasing to the True Lord.
He is in ecstasy, truly happy, night and day; his sorrows and sins are taken away.
He finds the True Name, and beholds the Guru; with the True Name in his mind, no filth sticks to him. ||2||
O friend, association with the Holy is the perfect cleansing bath.
