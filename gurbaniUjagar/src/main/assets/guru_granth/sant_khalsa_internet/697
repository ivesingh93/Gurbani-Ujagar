Jaitsree, Fourth Mehl:
I am Your child; I know nothing about Your state and extent; I am foolish, idiotic and ignorant.
O Lord, shower me with Your Mercy; bless me with an enlightened intellect; I am foolish - make me clever. ||1||
My mind is lazy and sleepy.
The Lord, Har, Har, has led me to meet the Holy Guru; meeting the Holy, the shutters have been opened wide. ||Pause||
O Guru, each and every instant, fill my heart with love; the Name of my Beloved is my breath of life.
Without the Name, I would die; the Name of my Lord and Master is to me like the drug to the addict. ||2||
Those who enshrine love for the Lord within their minds fulfill their pre-ordained destiny.
I worship their feet, each and every instant; the Lord seems very sweet to them. ||3||
My Lord and Master, Har, Har, has showered His Mercy upon His humble servant; separated for so long, he is now re-united with the Lord.
Blessed, blessed is the True Guru, who has implanted the Naam, the Name of the Lord within me; servant Nanak is a sacrifice to Him. ||4||3||
Jaitsree, Fourth Mehl:
I have found the True Guru, my Friend, the Greatest Being. Love and affection for the Lord has blossomed forth.
Maya, the snake, has seized the mortal; through the Word of the Guru, the Lord neutralizes the venom. ||1||
My mind is attached to the sublime essence of the Lord's Name.
The Lord has purified the sinners, uniting them with the Holy Guru; now, they taste the Lord's Name, and the sublime essence of the Lord. ||Pause||
Blessed, blessed is the good fortune of those who meet the Holy Guru; meeting with the Holy, they lovingly center themselves in the state of absolute absorption.
The fire of desire within them is quenched, and they find peace; they sing the Glorious Praises of the Immaculate Lord. ||2||
Those who do not obtain the Blessed Vision of the True Guru's Darshan, have misfortune pre-ordained for them.
In the love of duality, they are consigned to reincarnation through the womb, and they pass their lives totally uselessly. ||3||
O Lord, please, bless me with pure understanding, that I may serve the Feet of the Holy Guru; the Lord seems sweet to me.
Servant Nanak begs for the dust of the feet of the Holy; O Lord, be Merciful, and bless me with it. ||4||4||
Jaitsree, Fourth Mehl:
The Lord's Name does not abide within their hearts - their mothers should have been sterile.
These bodies wander around, forlorn and abandoned, without the Name; their lives waste away, and they die, crying out in pain. ||1||
O my mind, chant the Name of the Lord, the Lord within you.
The Merciful Lord God, Har, Har, has showered me with His Mercy; the Guru has imparted spiritual wisdom to me, and my mind has been instructed. ||Pause||
In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Kirtan of the Lord's Praise brings the most noble and exalted status; the Lord is found through the True Guru.
I am a sacrifice to my True Guru, who has revealed the Lord's hidden Name to me. ||2||
By great good fortune, I obtained the Blessed Vision of the Darshan of the Holy; it removes all stains of sin.
I have found the True Guru, the great, all-knowing King; He has shared with me the many Glorious Virtues of the Lord. ||3||
