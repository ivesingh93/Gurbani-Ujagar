When my Beloved came to live in my house, I began to sing the songs of bliss.
My friends and companions are happy; God leads me to meet the Perfect Guru. ||3||
My friends and companions are in ecstasy; the Guru has completed all my projects.
Says Nanak, I have met my Husband, the Giver of peace; He shall never leave me and go away. ||4||3||
Malaar, Fifth Mehl:
From a king to a worm, and from a worm to the lord of gods, they engage in evil to fill their bellies.
They renounce the Lord, the Ocean of Mercy, and worship some other; they are thieves and killers of the soul. ||1||
Forgetting the Lord, they suffer in sorrow and die.
They wander lost in reincarnation through all sorts of species; they do not find shelter anywhere. ||1||Pause||
Those who abandon their Lord and Master and think of some other, are foolish, stupid, idiotic donkeys.
How can they cross over the ocean in a paper boat? Their egotistical boasts that they will cross over are meaningless. ||2||
Shiva, Brahma, angels and demons, all burn in the fire of death.
Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord's Lotus Feet; O God, Creator, please do not send me into exile. ||3||4||
Raag Malaar, Fifth Mehl, Du-Padas, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
My God is detached and free of desire.
I cannot survive without Him, even for an instant. I am so in love with Him. ||1||Pause||
Associating with the Saints, God has come into my consciousness. By their Grace, I have been awakened.
Hearing the Teachings, my mind has become immaculate. Imbued with the Lord's Love, I sing His Glorious Praises. ||1||
Dedicating this mind, I have made friends with the Saints. They have become merciful to me; I am very fortunate.
I have found absolute peace - I cannot describe it. Nanak has obtained the dust of the feet of the humble. ||2||1||5||
Malaar, Fifth Mehl:
O mother, please lead me to union with my Beloved.
All my friends and companions sleep totally in peace; their Beloved Lord has come into the homes of their hearts. ||1||Pause||
I am worthless; God is forever Merciful. I am unworthy; what clever tricks could I try?
I claim to be on a par with those who are imbued with the Love of their Beloved. This is my stubborn egotism. ||1||
I am dishonored - I seek the Sanctuary of the One, the Guru, the True Guru, the Primal Being, the Giver of peace.
In an instant, all my pains have been taken away; Nanak passes the night of his life in peace. ||2||2||6||
Malaar, Fifth Mehl:
Rain down, O cloud; do not delay.
O beloved cloud, O support of the mind, you bring lasting bliss and joy to the mind. ||1||Pause||
I take to Your Support, O my Lord and Master; how could You forget me?
