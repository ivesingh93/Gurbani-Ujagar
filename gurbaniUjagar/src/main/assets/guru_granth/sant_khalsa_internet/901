Raag Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl, Second House, Du-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Sing the songs of Praise of the Lord.
Chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, total peace is obtained; coming and going is ended, my friend. ||1||Pause||
Singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, one is enlightened,
and comes to dwell in His lotus feet. ||1||
In the Society of the Saints, one is saved.
O Nanak, he crosses over the terrifying world-ocean. ||2||1||57||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
My Guru is perfect, my Guru is perfect.
Chanting the Lord's Name, I am always at peace; all my illness and fraud is dispelled. ||1||Pause||
Worship and adore that One Lord alone.
In His Sanctuary, eternal peace is obtained. ||1||
One who feels hunger for the Naam sleeps in peace.
Meditating in remembrance on the Lord, all pains are dispelled. ||2||
Enjoy celestial bliss, O my Siblings of Destiny.
The Perfect Guru has eradicated all anxiety. ||3||
Twenty-four hours a day, chant God's Chant.
O Nanak, He Himself shall save you. ||4||2||58||
Raag Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl, Partaal, Third House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
I humbly bow to the Lord, the Supreme Being.
The One, the One and Only Creator Lord permeates the water, the land, the earth and the sky. ||1||Pause||
Over and over again, the Creator Lord destroys, sustains and creates.
He has no home; He needs no nourishment. ||1||
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is deep and profound, strong, poised, lofty, exalted and infinite.
He stages His plays; His Virtues are priceless. Nanak is a sacrifice to Him. ||2||1||59||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
You must abandon your beauty, pleasures, fragrances and enjoyments; beguiled by gold and sexual desire, you must still leave Maya behind. ||1||Pause||
You gaze upon billions and trillions of treasures and riches, which delight and comfort your mind,
but these will not go along with you. ||1||
Entangled with children, spouse, siblings and friends, you are enticed and fooled; these pass like the shadow of a tree.
Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of His lotus feet; He has found peace in the faith of the Saints. ||2||2||60||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Raag Raamkalee, Ninth Mehl, Ti-Padas:
O mind, take the sheltering support of the Lord's Name.
Remembering Him in meditation, evil-mindedness is dispelled, and the state of Nirvaanaa is obtained. ||1||Pause||
Know that one who sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord is very fortunate.
The sins of countless incarnations are washed off, and he attains the heavenly realm. ||1||
