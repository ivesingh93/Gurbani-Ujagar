Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the whole world is just ashes. ||1||
Your Creative Power is marvelous, and Your Lotus Feet are admirable.
Your Praise is priceless, O True King. ||2||
God is the Support of the unsupported.
Meditate day and night on the Cherisher of the meek and humble. ||3||
God has been merciful to Nanak.
May I never forget God; He is my heart, my soul, my breath of life. ||4||10||
Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
As Gurmukh, obtain the true wealth.
Accept the Will of God as True. ||1||
Live, live, live forever.
Rise early each day, and drink in the Nectar of the Lord.
With your tongue, chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har. ||1||Pause||
In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the One Name alone shall save you.
Nanak speaks the wisdom of God. ||2||11||
Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
Serving the True Guru, all fruits and rewards are obtained.
The filth of so many lifetimes is washed away. ||1||
Your Name, God, is the Purifier of sinners.
Because of the karma of my past deeds, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I am saved.
I am blessed with honor in God's Court. ||2||
Serving at God's Feet, all comforts are obtained.
All the angels and demi-gods long for the dust of the feet of such beings. ||3||
Nanak has obtained the treasure of the Naam.

Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
God hugs His slave close in His Embrace.
He throws the slanderer into the fire. ||1||
The Lord saves His servants from the sinners.
No one can save the sinner. The sinner is destroyed by his own actions. ||1||Pause||

Raag Bhairao, Fifth Mehl, Chaupadas, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The Fascinating Lord, the Creator of all, the Formless Lord, is the Giver of Peace.
You have abandoned this Lord, and you serve another. Why are you intoxicated with the pleasures of corruption? ||1||
O my mind, meditate on the Lord of the Universe.
I have seen all other sorts of efforts; whatever you can think of, will only bring failure. ||1||Pause||
The blind, ignorant, self-willed manmukhs forsake their Lord and Master, and dwell on His slave Maya.
They slander those who worship their Lord; they are like beasts, without a Guru. ||2||
Soul, life, body and wealth all belong to God, but the faithless cynics claim that they own them.
