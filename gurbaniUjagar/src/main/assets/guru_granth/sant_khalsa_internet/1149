but without roots, how can there be any branches? ||1||
O my mind, meditate on the Guru, the Lord of the Universe.
The filth of countless incarnations shall be washed away. Breaking your bonds, you shall be united with the Lord. ||1||Pause||
How can a stone be purified by bathing at a sacred shrine of pilgrimage?
The filth of egotism clings to the mind.
Millions of rituals and actions taken are the root of entanglements.
Without meditating and vibrating on the Lord, the mortal gathers only worthless bundles of straw. ||2||
Without eating, hunger is not satisfied.
When the disease is cured, then the pain goes away.
The mortal is engrossed in sexual desire, anger, greed and attachment.
He does not meditate on God, that God who created him. ||3||
Blessed, blessed is the Holy Saint, and blessed is the Name of the Lord.
Twenty-four hours a day, sing the Kirtan, the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
Blessed is the devotee of the Lord, and blessed is the Creator Lord.
Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of God, the Primal, the Infinite. ||4||32||45||
Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
When the Guru was totally pleased, my fear was taken away.
I enshrine the Name of the Immaculate Lord within my mind.
He is Merciful to the meek, forever Compassionate.
All my entanglements are finished. ||1||
I have found peace, poise, and myriads of pleasures.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, fear and doubt are dispelled. My tongue chants the Ambrosial Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||Pause||
I have fallen in love with the Lord's Lotus Feet.
In an instant, the terrible demons are destroyed.
Twenty-four hours a day, I meditate and chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
The Guru is Himself the Savior Lord, the Lord of the Universe. ||2||
He Himself cherishes His servant forever.
He watches over every breath of His humble devotee.
Tell me, what is the nature of human beings?
The Lord extends His Hand, and saves them from the Messenger of Death. ||3||
Immaculate is the Glory, and Immaculate is the way of life,
of those who remember the Supreme Lord God in their minds.
The Guru, in His Mercy, has granted this Gift.
Nanak has obtained the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||33||46||
Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
My Guru is the All-powerful Lord, the Creator, the Cause of causes.
He is the Soul, the Breath of Life, the Giver of Peace, always near.
He is the Destroyer of fear, the Eternal, Unchanging, Sovereign Lord King.
Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, all fear is dispelled. ||1||
Wherever I look, is the Protection of Your Sanctuary.
I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to the Feet of the True Guru. ||1||Pause||
My tasks are perfectly accomplished, meeting the Divine Guru.
He is the Giver of all rewards. Serving Him, I am immaculate.
He reaches out with His Hand to His slaves.
The Name of the Lord abides in their hearts. ||2||
They are forever in bliss, and do not suffer at all.
No pain, sorrow or disease afflicts them.
Everything is Yours, O Creator Lord.
The Guru is the Supreme Lord God, the Inaccessible and Infinite. ||3||
His Glorious Grandeur is immaculate, and the Bani of His Word is wonderful!
The Perfect Supreme Lord God is pleasing to my mind.
He is permeating the waters, the lands and the skies.
O Nanak, everything comes from God. ||4||34||47||
Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
My mind and body are imbued with the Love of the Lord's Feet.
