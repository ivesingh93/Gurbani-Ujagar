The Treasure of Virtue, the Enticer of the mind, my Beloved is the Giver of peace to all.
Guru Nanak has led me to You, O God. Join with me, O my Best Friend, and hold me close in Your Embrace. ||2||5||28||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Now my mind is pleased and appeased by my Lord and Master.
The Holy Saint has become kind and compassionate to me, and has destroyed this demon of duality. ||1||Pause||
You are so beautiful, and You are so wise; You are elegant and all-knowing.
All the Yogis, spiritual teachers and meditators do not know even a bit of Your value. ||1||
You are the Master, You are the Lord under the royal canopy; You are the perfectly pervading Lord God.
Please bless me with the gift of service to the Saints; O Nanak, I am a sacrifice to the Lord. ||2||6||29||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
The Love of my Beloved comes into my conscious mind.
I have forgotten the entangling affairs of Maya, and I spend my life-night fighting with evil. ||1||Pause||
I serve the Lord; the Lord abides within my heart. I have found my Lord in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation.
So I have met with my enticingly beautiful Beloved; I have obtained the peace which I asked for. ||1||
The Guru has brought my Beloved under my control, and I enjoy Him with unrestrained pleasure.
I have become fearless; O Nanak, my fears have been eradicated. Chanting the Word, I have found the Lord. ||2||7||30||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
I am a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision, the Darshan of my Dear Lord.
The Naad, the Sound-current of His Word fills my ears; my body has settled gently into the Lap of my Beloved. ||1||Pause||
I was a discarded bride, and the Guru has made me a happy soul-bride. I have found the Elegant and All-knowing Lord.
That home, in which I was not even allowed to sit - I have found that place in which I can dwell. ||1||
God, the Love of His devotees, has come under the control of those who protect the honor of His Saints.
Says Nanak, my mid is pleased and appeased with the Lord, and my subservience to other people has come to an end. ||2||8||31||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Now my association with the five thieves has come to an end.
Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, my mind is in ecstasy; by Guru's Grace, I am released. ||1||Pause||
The impregnable place is guarded by countless ramparts and warriors.
This impregnable fortress cannot be touched, but with the assistance of the Saints, I have entered and robbed it. ||1||
I have found such a great treasure, a priceless, inexhaustible supply of jewels.
O servant Nanak, when God showered His Mercy on me, my mind drank in the sublime essence of the Lord. ||2||9||32||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Now my mind is absorbed in my Lord and Master.
The Perfect Guru has blessed me with the gift of the breath of life. I am involved with the Lord, like the fish with the water. ||1||Pause||
I have cast out sexual desire, anger, greed, egotism and envy; I have offered all this as a gift.
The Guru has implanted the medicine of the Lord's Mantra within me, and I have met with the All-knowing Lord God. ||1||
My household belongs to You, O my Lord and Master; the Guru has blessed me with God, and rid me of egotism.
