True is the tongue which is imbued with Truth, and true are the mind and body.
By praising any other than the True Lord, one's whole life is wasted. ||2||
Let Truth be the farm, Truth the seed, and Truth the merchandise you trade.
Night and day, you shall earn the profit of the Lord's Name; you shall have the treasure overflowing with the wealth of devotional worship. ||3||
Let Truth be your food, and let Truth be your clothes; let your True Support be the Name of the Lord.
One who is so blessed by the Lord, obtains a seat in the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. ||4||
In Truth we come, and in Truth we go, and then, we are not consigned to reincarnation again.
The Gurmukhs are hailed as True in the True Court; they merge in the True Lord. ||5||
Deep within they are True, and their minds are True; they sing the Glorious Praises of the True Lord.
In the true place, they praise the True Lord; I am a sacrifice to the True Guru. ||6||
True is the time, and true is the moment, when one falls in love with the True Lord.
Then, he sees Truth, and speaks the Truth; he realizes the True Lord pervading the entire Universe. ||7||
O Nanak, one merges with the True Lord, when He merges with Himself.
As it pleases Him, He preserves us; He Himself ordains His Will. ||8||1||
Wadahans, Third Mehl:
His mind wanders in the ten directions - how can he sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord?
The sensory organs are totally engrossed in sensuality; sexual desire and anger constantly afflict him. ||1||
Waaho! Waaho! Hail! Hail! Chant His Glorious Praises.
The Lord's Name is so difficult to obtain in this age; under Guru's Instruction, drink in the subtle essence of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Remembering the Word of the Shabad, the mind becomes immaculately pure, and then, one sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
Under Guru's Instruction, one comes to understand his own self, and then, he comes to dwell in the home of his inner self. ||2||
O my mind, be imbued forever with the Lord's Love, and sing forever the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
The Immaculate Lord is forever the Giver of peace; from Him, one receives the fruits of his heart's desires. ||3||
I am lowly, but I have been exalted, entering the Sanctuary of the Lord.
He has lifted up the sinking stone; True is His glorious greatness. ||4||
From poison, I have been transformed into Ambrosial Nectar; under Guru's Instruction, I have obtained wisdom.
From bitter herbs, I have been transformed into sandalwood; this fragrance permeates me deep within. ||5||
This human birth is so precious; one must earn the right to come into the world.
By perfect destiny, I met the True Guru, and I meditate on the Lord's Name. ||6||
The self-willed manmukhs are deluded; attached to corruption, they waste away their lives in vain.
The Name of the Lord is forever an ocean of peace, but the manmukhs do not love the Word of the Shabad. ||7||
Everyone can chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har with their mouths, but only a few enshrine it within their hearts.
O Nanak, those who enshrine the Lord within their hearts, attain liberation and emancipation. ||8||2||
Wadahans, First Mehl, Chhant:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Why bother to wash the body, polluted by falsehood?
One's cleansing bath is only approved, if he practices Truth.
When there is Truth within the heart, then one becomes True, and obtains the True Lord.
