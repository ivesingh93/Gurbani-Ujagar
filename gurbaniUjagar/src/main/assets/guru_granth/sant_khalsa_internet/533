One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Dayv-Gandhaaree, Fifth Mehl:
I offer my prayer to my True Guru.
The Destroyer of distress has become kind and merciful, and all my anxiety is over. ||Pause||
I am a sinner, hypocritical and greedy, but still, He puts up with all of my merits and demerits.
Placing His hand on my forehead, He has exalted me. The wicked ones who wanted to destroy me have been killed. ||1||
He is generous and benevolent, the beautifier of all, the embodiment of peace; the Blessed Vision of His Darshan is so fruitful!
Says Nanak, He is the Giver to the unworthy; I enshrine His Lotus Feet within my heart. ||2||24||
Dayv-Gandhaaree, Fifth Mehl:
My God is the Master of the masterless.
I have come to the Sanctuary of the Savior Lord. ||Pause||
Protect me on all sides, O Lord;
protect me in the future, in the past, and at the very last moment. ||1||
Whenever something comes to mind, it is You.
Contemplating Your virtues, my mind is sanctified. ||2||
I hear and sing the Hymns of the Guru's Word.
I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of the Darshan of the Holy. ||3||
Within my mind, I have the Support of the One Lord alone.
O Nanak, my God is the Creator of all. ||4||25||
Dayv-Gandhaaree, Fifth Mehl:
God, this is my heart's desire:
O treasure of kindness, O Merciful Lord, please make me the slave of your Saints. ||Pause||
In the early hours of the morning, I fall at the feet of Your humble servants; night and day, I obtain the Blessed Vision of their Darshan.
Dedicating my body and mind, I serve the humble servant of the Lord; with my tongue, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||
With each and every breath, I meditate in remembrance on my God; I live continually in the Society of the Saints.
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is my only support and wealth; O Nanak, from this, I obtain bliss. ||2||26||
Raag Dayv-Gandhaaree, Fifth Mehl, Third House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O friend, such is the Dear Lord whom I have obtained.
He does not leave me, and He always keeps me company. Meeting the Guru, night and day, I sing His Praises. ||1||Pause||
I met the Fascinating Lord, who has blessed me with all comforts; He does not leave me to go anywhere else.
I have seen the mortals of many and various types, but they are not equal to even a hair of my Beloved. ||1||
His palace is so beautiful! His gate is so wonderful! The celestial melody of the sound current resounds there.
Says Nanak, I enjoy eternal bliss; I have obtained a permanent place in the home of my Beloved. ||2||1||27||
Dayv-Gandhaaree, Fifth Mehl:
My mind longs for the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, and His Name.
I have wandered everywhere, and now I have come to follow the Saint. ||1||Pause||
Whom should I serve? Whom should I worship in adoration? Whoever I see shall pass away.
