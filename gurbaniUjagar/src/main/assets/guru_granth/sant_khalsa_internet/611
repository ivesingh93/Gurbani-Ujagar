O my mind, emancipation is attained in the Sanctuary of the Holy Saints.
Without the Perfect Guru, births and deaths do not cease, and one comes and goes, over and over again. ||Pause||
The whole world is entangled in what is called the delusion of doubt.
The perfect devotee of the Primal Lord God remains detached from everything. ||2||
Don't indulge in slander for any reason, for everything is the creation of the Lord and Master.
One who is blessed with the Mercy of my God, dwells on the Name in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||3||
The Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent Lord, the True Guru, saves all.
Says Nanak, without the Guru, no one crosses over; this is the perfect essence of all contemplation. ||4||9||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
I have searched and searched and searched, and found that the Lord's Name is the most sublime reality.
Contemplating it for even an instant, sins are erased; the Gurmukh is carried across and saved. ||1||
Drink in the sublime essence of the Lord's Name, O man of spiritual wisdom.
Listening to the Ambrosial Words of the Holy Saints, the mind finds absolute fulfillment and satisfaction. ||Pause||
Liberation, pleasures, and the true way of life are obtained from the Lord, the Giver of all peace.
The Perfect Lord, the Architect of Destiny, blesses His slave with the gift of devotional worship. ||2||
Hear with your ears, and sing with your tongue, and meditate within your heart on Him.
The Lord and Master is all-powerful, the Cause of causes; without Him, there is nothing at all. ||3||
By great good fortune, I have obtained the jewel of human life; have mercy on me, O Merciful Lord.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, Nanak sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and contemplates Him forever in meditation. ||4||10||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
After taking your cleansing bath, remember your God in meditation, and your mind and body shall be free of disease.
Millions of obstacles are removed, in the Sanctuary of God, and good fortune dawns. ||1||
The Word of God's Bani, and His Shabad, are the best utterances.
So constantly sing them, listen to them, and read them, O Siblings of Destiny, and the Perfect Guru shall save you. ||Pause||
The glorious greatness of the True Lord is immeasurable; the Merciful Lord is the Lover of His devotees.
He has preserved the honor of His Saints; from the very beginning of time, His Nature is to cherish them. ||2||
So eat the Ambrosial Name of the Lord as your food; put it into your mouth at all times.
The pains of old age and death shall all depart, when you constantly sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe. ||3||
My Lord and Master has heard my prayer, and all my affairs have been resolved.
The glorious greatness of Guru Nanak is manifest, throughout all the ages. ||4||11||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl, Second House, Chau-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The One God is our father; we are the children of the One God. You are our Guru.
Listen, friends: my soul is a sacrifice, a sacrifice to You; O Lord, reveal to me the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. ||1||
