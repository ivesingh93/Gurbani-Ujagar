Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
The Name of the Lord is cooling and soothing.
Searching, searching the Vedas, the Puraanas and the Simritees, the Holy Saints have realized this. ||1||Pause||
In the worlds of Shiva, Brahma and Indra, I wandered around, burning up with envy.
Meditating, meditating in remembrance on my Lord and Master, I became cool and calm; my pains, sorrows and doubts are gone. ||1||
Whoever has been saved in the past or the present, was saved through loving devotional worship of the Divine Lord.
This is Nanak's prayer: O Dear God, please let me serve the humble Saints. ||2||52||75||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl;
O my tongue, sing the Ambrosial Praises of the Lord.
Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, listen to the Lord's Sermon, and chant God's Name. ||1||Pause||
So gather in the jewel, the wealth of the Lord's Name; love God with your mind and body.
You must realize that all other wealth is false; this alone is the true purpose of life. ||1||
He is the Giver of the soul, the breath of life and liberation; lovingly tune in to the One and Only Lord.
Says Nanak, I have entered His Sanctuary; He gives sustenance to all. ||2||53||76||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
I cannot do anything else.
I have taken this Support, meeting the Saints; I have entered the Sanctuary of the One Lord of the World. ||1||Pause||
The five wicked enemies are within this body; they lead the mortal to practice evil and corruption.
He has infinite hope, but his days are numbered, and old age is sapping his strength. ||1||
He is the Help of the helpless, the Merciful Lord, the Ocean of Peace, the Destroyer of all pains and fears.
Slave Nanak longs for this blessing, that he may live, gazing upon the Feet of God. ||2||54||77||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Without the Lord's Name, flavors are tasteless and insipid.
Sing the Sweet Ambrosial Praises of the Lord's Kirtan; day and night, the Sound-current of the Naad will resonate and resound. ||1||Pause||
Meditating in remembrance on the Lord, total peace and bliss are obtained, and all sorrows are taken away.
The profit of the Lord, Har, Har, is found in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; so load it and bring it on home. ||1||
He is the Highest of all, the Highest of the high; His celestial economy has no limit.
Nanak cannot even express His Glorious Grandeur; gazing upon Him, he is wonder-struck. ||2||55||78||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
The mortal came to hear and chant the Word of the Guru's Bani.
But he has forgotten the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and he has become attached to other temptations. His life is totally worthless! ||1||Pause||
O my unconscious mind, become conscious and figure it out; the Saints speak the Unspoken Speech of the Lord.
So gather in your profits - worship and adore the Lord within your heart; your coming and going in reincarnation shall end. ||1||
Efforts, powers and clever tricks are Yours; if You bless me with them, I repeat Your Name.
They alone are devotees, and they alone are attached to devotional worship, O Nanak, who are pleasing to God. ||2||56||79||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Those who deal in the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are wealthy.
So become a partner with them, and earn the wealth of the Naam. Contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||1||Pause||
