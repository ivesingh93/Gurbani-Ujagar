Engrossed in sexual desire, anger and egotism, he wanders around insane.
When the Messenger of Death hits him on the head with his club, then he regrets and repents.
Without the Perfect, Divine Guru, he roams around like Satan. ||9||
Shalok:
Power is fraudulent, beauty is fraudulent, and wealth is fraudulent, as is pride of ancestry.
One may gather poison through deception and fraud, O Nanak, but without the Lord, nothing shall go along with him in the end. ||1||
Beholding the bitter melon, he is deceived, since it appears so pretty
But it is not worth even a shell, O Nanak; the riches of Maya will not go along with anyone. ||2||
Pauree:
It shall not go along with you when you depart - why do you bother to collect it?
Tell me, why do you try so hard to acquire that which you must leave behind in the end?
Forgetting the Lord, how can you be satisfied? Your mind cannot be pleased.
One who forsakes God, and attaches himself to another, shall be immersed in hell.
Be kind and compassionate to Nanak, O Lord, and dispel his fear. ||10||
Shalok:
Princely pleasures are not sweet; sensual enjoyments are not sweet; the pleasures of Maya are not sweet.
The Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is sweet, O slave Nanak; the Blessed Vision of God's Darshan is sweet. ||1||
I have enshrined that love which drenches my soul.
I have been pierced by the Truth, O Nanak; the Master seems so sweet to me. ||2||
Pauree:
Nothing seems sweet to His devotees, except the Lord.
All other tastes are bland and insipid; I have tested them and seen them.
Ignorance, doubt and suffering are dispelled, when the Guru becomes one's advocate.
The Lord's lotus feet have pierced my mind, and I am dyed in the deep crimson color of His Love.
My soul, breath of life, body and mind belong to God; all falsehood has left me. ||11||
Shalok:
Leaving the water, the fish cannot live; the rainbird cannot live without the raindrops from the clouds.
The deer is enticed by the sound of the hunter's bell, and shot through with the arrow; the bumble bee is entangled in the fragrance of the flowers.
The Saints are entranced by the Lord's lotus feet; O Nanak, they desire nothing else. ||1||
Show me Your face, for even an instant, Lord, and I will not give my consciousness to any other.
My life is with the Lord Master, O Nanak, the Friend of the Saints. ||2||
Pauree:
How can the fish live without water?
Without the raindrops, how can the rainbird be satisfied?
The deer, entranced by the sound of the hunter's bell, runs straight to him;
the bumble bee is greedy for the flower's fragrance; finding it, he traps himself in it.
Just so, the humble Saints love the Lord; beholding the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, they are satisfied and satiated. ||12||
Shalok:
They contemplate the Lord's lotus feet; they worship and adore Him with each and every breath.
They do not forget the Name of the imperishable Lord; O Nanak, the Transcendent Lord fulfills their hopes. ||1||
He is woven into the fabric of my mind; He is not outside of it, even for an instant.
O Nanak, the True Lord and Master fulfills my hopes, and always watches over me. ||2||
Pauree:
My hopes rest in You, O Lord of the universe; please, fulfill them.
Meeting with the Lord of the world, the Lord of the universe, I shall never grieve.
Grant me the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, the desire of my mind, and my worries shall be over.
