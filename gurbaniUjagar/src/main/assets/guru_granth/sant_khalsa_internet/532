Be Merciful to me, O my Lord and Master, that I might never forsake them from my mind. ||1||Pause||
Applying the dust of the feet of the Holy to my face and forehead, I burn away the poison of sexual desire and anger.
I judge myself to be the lowest of all; in this way, I instill peace within my mind. ||1||
I sing the Glorious Praises of the Imperishable Lord and Master, and I shake off all my sins.
I have found the gift of the treasure of the Naam, O Nanak; I hug it close, and enshrine it in my heart. ||2||19||
Dayv-Gandhaaree, Fifth Mehl:
Dear God, I long to behold the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.
I cherish this beautiful meditation day and night; You are dearer to me than my soul, dearer than life itself. ||1||Pause||
I have studied and contemplated the essence of the Shaastras, the Vedas and the Puraanas.
Protector of the meek, Lord of the breath of life, O Perfect One, carry us across the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||
Since the very beginning, and throughout the ages, the humble devotees have been Your servants; in the midst of the world of corruption, You are their Support.
Nanak longs for the dust of the feet of such humble beings; the Transcendent Lord is the Giver of all. ||2||20||
Dayv-Gandhaaree, Fifth Mehl:
Your humble servant, O Lord, is intoxicated with Your sublime essence.
One who obtains the treasure of the Nectar of Your Love, does not renounce it to go somewhere else. ||1||Pause||
While sitting, he repeats the Lord's Name, Har, Har; while sleeping, he repeats the Lord's Name, Har, Har; he eats the Nectar of the Lord's Name as his food.
Bathing in the dust of the feet of the Holy is equal to taking cleansing baths at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage. ||1||
How fruitful is the birth of the Lord's humble servant; the Creator is his Father.
O Nanak, one who recognizes the Perfect Lord God, takes all with him, and saves everyone. ||2||21||
Dayv-Gandhaaree, Fifth Mehl:
O mother, without the Guru, spiritual wisdom is not obtained.
They wander around, weeping and crying out in various ways, but the Lord of the World does not meet them. ||1||Pause||
The body is tied up with emotional attachment, disease and sorrow, and so it is lured into countless reincarnations.
He finds no place of rest without the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; to whom should he go and cry? ||1||
When my Lord and Master shows His Mercy, we lovingly focus our consciousness on the feet of the Holy.
The most horrible agonies are dispelled in an instant, O Nanak, and we merge in the Blessed Vision of the Lord. ||2||22||
Dayv-Gandhaaree, Fifth Mehl:
The Lord and Master Himself has become Merciful.
I have been emancipated, and I have become the embodiment of bliss; I am the Lord's child - He has saved me. ||Pause||
With my palms pressed together, I offer my prayer; within my mind, I meditate on the Supreme Lord God.
Giving me His hand, the Transcendent Lord has eradicated all my sins. ||1||
Husband and wife join together in rejoicing, celebrating the Victory of the Lord Master.
Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to the humble servant of the Lord, who emancipates everyone. ||2||23||
