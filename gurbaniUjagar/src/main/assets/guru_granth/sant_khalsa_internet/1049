In love and attachment to Maya, he has no understanding at all.
The blind, self-willed manmukh sees nothing; through the Guru's Teachings, the Naam is gloriously revealed. ||14||
The manmukhs are asleep in egotism and Maya.
They do not watch over their own homes, and are ruined in the end.
They slander others, and burn in great anxiety; they dwell in pain and suffering. ||15||
The Creator Himself has created the creation.
He blesses the Gurmukh with understanding.
O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Naam - their minds become immaculate; they dwell in the Naam, and only the Naam. ||16||5||
Maaroo, Third Mehl:
I serve the One Lord, who is eternal, stable and True.
Attached to duality, the whole world is false.
Following the Guru's Teachings, I praise the True Lord forever, pleased with the Truest of the True. ||1||
Your Glorious Virtues are so many, Lord; I do not know even one.
The Life of the world, the Great Giver, attaches us to himself.
He Himself forgives, and bestows glorious greatness. Following the Guru's Teachings, this mind is delighted. ||2||
The Word of the Shabad has subdued the waves of Maya.
Egotism has been conquered, and this mind has become immaculate.
I intuitively sing His Glorious Praises, imbued with the Lord's Love. My tongue chants and savors the Lord's Name. ||3||
Crying out, "Mine, mine!" he spends his life.
The self-willed manmukh does not understand; he wanders around in ignorance.
The Messenger of Death watches over him every moment, every instant; night and day, his life is wasting away. ||4||
He practices greed within, and does not understand.
He does not see the Messenger of Death hovering over his head.
Whatever one does in this world, will come to face him in the hereafter; what can he do at that very last moment? ||5||
Those who are attached to the Truth are true.
The self-willed manmukhs, attached to duality, weep and wail.
He is the Lord and Master of both worlds; He Himself delights in virtue. ||6||
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, His humble servant is exalted forever.
This mind is enticed by the Naam, the source of nectar.
It is not stained at all by the dirt of attachment to Maya; through the Guru's Teachings, it is pleased and saturated with the Lord's Name. ||7||
The One Lord is contained within all.
By Guru's Grace, He is revealed.
One who subdues his ego, finds lasting peace; he drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar of the True Name. ||8||
God is the Destroyer of sin and pain.
The Gurmukh serves Him, and contemplates the Word of the Shabad.
He Himself is pervading everything. The Gurmukh's body and mind are saturated and pleased. ||9||
The world is burning in the fire of Maya.
The Gurmukh extinguishes this fire, by contemplating the Shabad.
Deep within are peace and tranquility, and lasting peace is obtained. Following the Guru's Teachings, one is blessed with the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||10||
Even Indra, seated upon his throne, is caught in the fear of death.
The Messenger of Death will not spare them, even though they try all sorts of things.
When one meets with the True Guru, one is liberated, drinking in and savoring the sublime essence of the Lord, Har, Har. ||11||
There is no devotion within the self-willed manmukh.
Through devotional worship, the Gurmukh obtains peace and tranquility.
Forever pure and sanctified is the Word of the Guru's Bani; following the Guru's Teachings, one's inner being is drenched in it. ||12||
I have considered Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.
They are bound by the three qualities - the three gunas; they are far away from liberation.
