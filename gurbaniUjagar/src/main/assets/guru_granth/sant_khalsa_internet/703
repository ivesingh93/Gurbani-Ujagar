The Jewel of the Lord is deep within my heart, but I do not have any knowledge of Him.
O servant Nanak, without vibrating, meditating on the Lord God, human life is uselessly wasted and lost. ||2||1||
Jaitsree, Ninth Mehl:
O Dear Lord, please, save my honor!
The fear of death has entered my heart; I cling to the Protection of Your Sanctuary, O Lord, ocean of mercy. ||1||Pause||
I am a great sinner, foolish and greedy; but now, at last, I have grown weary of committing sins.
I cannot forget the fear of dying; this anxiety is consuming my body. ||1||
I have been trying to liberate myself, running around in the ten directions.
The pure, immaculate Lord abides deep within my heart, but I do not understand the secret of His mystery. ||2||
I have no merit, and I know nothing about meditation or austerities; what should I do now?
O Nanak, I am exhausted; I seek the shelter of Your Sanctuary; O God, please bless me with the gift of fearlessness. ||3||2||
Jaitsree, Ninth Mehl:
O mind, embrace true contemplation.
Without the Lord's Name, know that this whole world is false. ||1||Pause||
The Yogis are tired of searching for Him, but they have not found His limit.
You must understand that the Lord and Master is near at hand, but He has no form or feature. ||1||
The Naam, the Name of the Lord is purifying in the world, and yet you never remember it.
Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of the One, before whom the whole world bows down; please, preserve and protect me, by Your innate nature. ||2||3||
Jaitsree, Fifth Mehl, Chhant, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Shalok:
I am thirsty for the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, day and night; I yearn for Him constantly, night and day.
Opening the door, O Nanak, the Guru has led me to meet with the Lord, my Friend. ||1||
Chhant:
Listen, O my intimate friend - I have just one prayer to make.
I have been wandering around, searching for that enticing, sweet Beloved.
Whoever leads me to my Beloved - I would cut off my head and offer it to him, even if I were granted the Blessed Vision of His Darshan for just an instant.
My eyes are drenched with the Love of my Beloved; without Him, I do not have even a moment's peace.
My mind is attached to the Lord, like the fish to the water, and the rainbird, thirsty for the raindrops.
Servant Nanak has found the Perfect Guru; his thirst is totally quenched. ||1||
O intimate friend, my Beloved has all these loving companions; I cannot compare to any of them.
O intimate friend, each of them is more beautiful than the others; who could consider me?
Each of them is more beautiful than the others; countless are His lovers, constantly enjoying bliss with Him.
Beholding them, desire wells up in my mind; when will I obtain the Lord, the treasure of virtue?
I dedicate my mind to those who please and attract my Beloved.
Says Nanak, hear my prayer, O happy soul-brides; tell me, what does my Husband Lord look like? ||2||
O intimate friend, my Husband Lord does whatever He pleases; He is not dependent on anyone.
