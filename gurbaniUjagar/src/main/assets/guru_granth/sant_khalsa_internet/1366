Let those who die, die such a death, that they shall never have to die again. ||29||
Kabeer, it is so difficult to obtain this human body; it does not just come over and over again.
It is like the ripe fruit on the tree; when it falls to the ground, it cannot be re-attached to the branch. ||30||
Kabeer, you are Kabeer; your name means great.
O Lord, You are Kabeer. The Jewel of the Lord is obtained, when the mortal first gives up his body. ||31||
Kabeer, do not struggle in stubborn pride; nothing happens just because you say so.
No one can erase the actions of the Merciful Lord. ||32||
Kabeer, no one who is false can withstand the Touchstone of the Lord.
He alone can pass the test of the Lord's Touchstone, who remains dead while yet alive. ||33||
Kabeer, some wear gaudy robes, and chew betel leaves and betel nuts.
Without the Name of the One Lord, they are bound and gagged and taken to the City of Death. ||34||
Kabeer, the boat is old, and it has thousands of holes.
Those who are light get across, while those who carry the weight of their sins on their heads are drowned. ||35||
Kabeer, the bones burn like wood, and the hair burns like straw.
Seeing the world burning like this, Kabeer has become sad. ||36||
Kabeer, do not be so proud of your bones wrapped up in skin.
Those who were on their horses and under their canopies, were eventually buried under the ground. ||37||
Kabeer, do not be so proud of your tall mansions.
Today or tomorrow, you shall lIE beneath the ground, and the grass shall grow above you. ||38||
Kabeer, do not be so proud, and do not laugh at the poor.
Your boat is still out at sea; who knows what will happen? ||39||
Kabeer, do not be so proud, looking at your beautiful body.
Today or tomorrow, you will have to leave it behind, like the snake shedding its skin. ||40||
Kabeer, if you must rob and plunder, then plunder the plunder of the Lord's Name.
Otherwise, in the world hereafter, you will regret and repent, when the breath of life leaves the body. ||41||
Kabeer, there is no one born, who burns his own home,
and burning his five sons, remains lovingly attuned to the Lord. ||42||
Kabeer, how rare are those who sell their son and sell their daughter
and, entering into partnership with Kabeer, deal with the Lord. ||43||
Kabeer, let me remind you of this. Do not be skeptical or cynical.
Those pleasures which you enjoyed so much in the past - now you must eat their fruits. ||44||
Kabeer, at first, I thought learning was good; then I thought Yoga was better.
I shall never abandon devotional worship of the Lord, even though people may slander me. ||45||
Kabeer, how can the wretched people slander me? They have no wisdom or intelligence.
Kabeer continues to dwell upon the Lord's Name; I have abandoned all other affairs. ||46||
Kabeer, the robe of the stranger-soul has caught fire on all four sides.
The cloth of the body has been burnt and reduced to charcoal, but the fire did not touch the thread of the soul. ||47||
Kabeer, the cloth has been burnt and reduced to charcoal, and the begging bowl is shattered into pieces.
The poor Yogi has played out his game; only ashes remain on his seat. ||48||
