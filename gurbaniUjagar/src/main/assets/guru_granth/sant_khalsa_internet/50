The True Guru is the Deep and Profound Ocean of Peace, the Destroyer of sin.
For those who serve their Guru, there is no punishment at the hands of the Messenger of Death.
There is none to compare with the Guru; I have searched and looked throughout the entire universe.
The True Guru has bestowed the Treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. O Nanak, the mind is filled with peace. ||4||20||90||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
People eat what they believe to be sweet, but it turns out to be bitter in taste.
They attach their affections to brothers and friends, uselessly engrossed in corruption.
They vanish without a moment's delay; without God's Name, they are stunned and amazed. ||1||
O my mind, attach yourself to the service of the True Guru.
Whatever is seen, shall pass away. Abandon the intellectualizations of your mind. ||1||Pause||
Like the mad dog running around in all directions,
the greedy person, unaware, consumes everything, edible and non-edible alike.
Engrossed in the intoxication of sexual desire and anger, people wander through reincarnation over and over again. ||2||
Maya has spread out her net, and in it, she has placed the bait.
The bird of desire is caught, and cannot find any escape, O my mother.
One who does not know the Lord who created him, comes and goes in reincarnation over and over again. ||3||
By various devices, and in so many ways, this world is enticed.
They alone are saved, whom the All-powerful, Infinite Lord protects.
The servants of the Lord are saved by the Love of the Lord. O Nanak, I am forever a sacrifice to them. ||4||21||91||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl, Second House:
The herdsman comes to the pasture lands-what good are his ostentatious displays here?
When your allotted time is up, you must go. Take care of your real hearth and home. ||1||
O mind, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and serve the True Guru with love.
Why do you take pride in trivial matters? ||1||Pause||
Like an overnight guest, you shall arise and depart in the morning.
Why are you so attached to your household? It is all like flowers in the garden. ||2||
Why do you say, "Mine, mine?" Look to God, who has given it to you.
It is certain that you must arise and depart, and leave behind your hundreds of thousands and millions. ||3||
Through 8.4 million incarnations you have wandered, to obtain this rare and precious human life.
O Nanak, remember the Naam, the Name of the Lord; the day of departure is drawing near! ||4||22||92||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
As long as the soul-companion is with the body, it dwells in happiness.
But when the companion arises and departs, then the body-bride mingles with dust. ||1||
My mind has become detached from the world; it longs to see the Vision of God's Darshan.
Blessed is Your Place. ||1||Pause||
As long as the soul-husband dwells in the body-house, everyone greets you with respect.
But when the soul-husband arises and departs, then no one cares for you at all. ||2||
In this world of your parents' home, serve your Husband Lord; in the world beyond, in your in-laws' home, you shall dwell in peace.
Meeting with the Guru, be a sincere student of proper conduct, and suffering shall never touch you. ||3||
Everyone shall go to their Husband Lord. Everyone shall be given their ceremonial send-off after their marriage.
