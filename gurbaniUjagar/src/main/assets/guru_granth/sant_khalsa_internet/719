Raag Bairaaree, Fourth Mehl, First House, Du-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Listen, O mind, to the Unspoken Speech of the Lord's Name.
Riches, wisdom, supernatural spiritual powers and peace are obtained, by vibrating, meditating on the Lord God, under Guru's Instruction. ||1||Pause||
Numerous legends, the Puraanas, and the six Shaastras, sing the sublime Praises of the Lord.
Shiva and the three hundred thirty million gods meditate on the Lord, but they do not know the secret of His mystery. ||1||
The angelic and divine beings, and the celestial singers sing His Praises; all Creation sings of Him.
O Nanak, those whom the Lord blesses with His Kind Mercy, become the good Saints of the Lord God. ||2||1||
Bairaaree, Fourth Mehl:
O mind, those who meet the Lord's humble servants, sing His Praises.
They are blessed with the gift of the jewel of the Lord, Har, Har, the sublime jewel of the Lord, by the Guru, the True Guru. ||1||Pause||
I offer my mind, body and everything to that humble being who recites the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
I offer my wealth, the riches of Maya and my property to that one who leads me to meet the Lord, my friend. ||1||
When the Lord of the world bestowed just a tiny bit of His Mercy, for just an instant, then I meditated on the Praise of the Lord, Har, Har, Har.
The Lord and Master has met servant Nanak, and the pain of the sickness of egotism has been eliminated. ||2||2||
Bairaaree, Fourth Mehl:
The Lord's humble servant sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord's Name.
Even if someone slanders the Lord's humble servant, he does not give up his own goodness. ||1||Pause||
Whatever the Lord and Master does, He does by Himself; the Lord Himself does the deeds.
The Lord and Master Himself imparts understanding; the Lord Himself inspires us to speak. ||1||
