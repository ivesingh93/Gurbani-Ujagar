Wearing blue robes, they seek the approval of the Muslim rulers.
Accepting bread from the Muslim rulers, they still worship the Puraanas.
They eat the meat of the goats, killed after the Muslim prayers are read over them,
but they do not allow anyone else to enter their kitchen areas.
They draw lines around them, plastering the ground with cow-dung.
The false come and sit within them.
They cry out, "Do not touch our food,
this food of ours will be polluted!
But with their polluted bodies, they commit evil deeds.
With filthy minds, they try to cleanse their mouths.
Says Nanak, meditate on the True Lord.
If you are pure, you will obtain the True Lord. ||2||
Pauree:
All are within Your mind; You see and move them under Your Glance of Grace, O Lord.
You Yourself grant them glory, and You Yourself cause them to act.
The Lord is the greatest of the great; great is His world. He enjoins all to their tasks.
If he should cast an angry glance, He can transform kings into blades of grass.
Even though they may beg from door to door, no one will give them charity. ||16||
Shalok, First Mehl:
The thief robs a house, and offers the stolen goods to his ancestors.
In the world hereafter, this is recognized, and his ancestors are considered thieves as well.
The hands of the go-between are cut off; this is the Lord's justice.
O Nanak, in the world hereafter, that alone is received, which one gives to the needy from his own earnings and labor. ||1||
First Mehl:
As a woman has her periods, month after month,
so does falsehood dwell in the mouth of the false; they suffer forever, again and again.
They are not called pure, who sit down after merely washing their bodies.
Only they are pure, O Nanak, within whose minds the Lord abides. ||2||
Pauree:
With saddled horses, as fast as the wind, and harems decorated in every way;
in houses and pavilions and lofty mansions, they dwell, making ostentatious shows.
They act out their minds' desires, but they do not understand the Lord, and so they are ruined.
Asserting their authority, they eat, and beholding their mansions, they forget about death.
But old age comes, and youth is lost. ||17||
Shalok, First Mehl:
If one accepts the concept of impurity, then there is impurity everywhere.
In cow-dung and wood there are worms.
As many as are the grains of corn, none is without life.
First, there is life in the water, by which everything else is made green.
How can it be protected from impurity? It touches our own kitchen.
O Nanak, impurity cannot be removed in this way; it is washed away only by spiritual wisdom. ||1||
First Mehl:
The impurity of the mind is greed, and the impurity of the tongue is falsehood.
The impurity of the eyes is to gaze upon the beauty of another man's wife, and his wealth.
The impurity of the ears is to listen to the slander of others.
O Nanak, the mortal's soul goes, bound and gagged to the city of Death. ||2||
First Mehl:
All impurity comes from doubt and attachment to duality.
Birth and death are subject to the Command of the Lord's Will; through His Will we come and go.
Eating and drinking are pure, since the Lord gives nourishment to all.
O Nanak, the Gurmukhs, who understand the Lord, are not stained by impurity. ||3||
