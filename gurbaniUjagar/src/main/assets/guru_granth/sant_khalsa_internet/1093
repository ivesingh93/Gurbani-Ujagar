O spiritual teachers, understand this: the Unspoken Speech is in the mind.
Without the Guru, the essence of reality is not found; the Invisible Lord dwells everywhere.
One meets the True Guru, and then the Lord is known, when the Word of the Shabad comes to dwell in the mind.
When self-conceit departs, doubt and fear also depart, and the pain of birth and death is removed.
Following the Guru's Teachings, the Unseen Lord is seen; the intellect is exalted, and one is carried across.
O Nanak, chant the chant of 'Sohang hansaa' - 'He is me, and I am Him.' The three worlds are absorbed in Him. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Some assay their mind-jewel, and contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Only a few of those humble beings are known in this world, in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga.
One's self remains blended with the Lord's Self, when egotism and duality are conquered.
O Nanak, those who are imbued with the Naam cross over the difficult, treacherous and terrifying world-ocean. ||2||
Pauree:
The self-willed manmukhs do not search within their own selves; they are deluded by their egotistical pride.
Wandering in the four directions, they grow weary, tormented by burning desire within.
They do not study the Simritees and the Shaastras; the manmukhs waste away and are lost.
Without the Guru, no one finds the Naam, the Name of the True Lord.
One who contemplates the essence of spiritual wisdom and meditates on the Lord is saved. ||19||
Shalok, Second Mehl:
He Himself knows, He Himself acts, and He Himself does it right.
So stand before Him, O Nanak, and offer your prayers. ||1||
First Mehl:
He who created the creation, watches over it; He Himself knows.
Unto whom should I speak, O Nanak, when everything is contained within the home of the heart? ||2||
Pauree:
Forget everything, and be friends with the One Lord alone.
Your mind and body shall be enraptured, and the Lord shall burn away your sins.
Your comings and goings in reincarnation shall cease; you shall not be reborn and dIE again.
The True Name shall be your Support, and you shall not burn in sorrow and attachment.
O Nanak, gather in the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within your mind. ||20||
Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
You do not forget Maya from your mind; you beg for it with each and every breath.
You do not even think of that God; O Nanak, it is not in your karma. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
Maya and its wealth shall not go along with you, so why do you cling to it - are you blind?
Meditate on the Guru's Feet, and the bonds of Maya shall be cut away from you. ||2||
Pauree:
By the Pleasure of His Will, the Lord inspires us to obey the Hukam of His Command; by the Pleasure of His Will, we find peace.
By the Pleasure of His Will, He leads us to meet the True Guru; by the Pleasure of His Will, we meditate on the Truth.
There is no other gift as great as the Pleasure of His Will; this Truth is spoken and proclaimed.
Those who have such pre-ordained destiny, practice and live the Truth.
Nanak has entered His Sanctuary; He created the world. ||21||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Those who do not have spiritual wisdom within, do not have even an iota of the Fear of God.
O Nanak, why kill those who are already dead? The Lord of the Universe Himself has killed them. ||1||
Third Mehl:
To read the horoscope of the mind, is the most sublime joyful peace.
He alone is called a good Brahmin, who understands God in contemplative meditation.
He praises the Lord, and reads of the Lord, and contemplates the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
