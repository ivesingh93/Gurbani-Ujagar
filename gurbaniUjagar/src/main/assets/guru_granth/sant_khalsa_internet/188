Nanak: my honor and glory are Yours, God. ||4||40||109||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Those who have You on their side, O All-powerful Lord -
no black stain can stick to them. ||1||
O Lord of wealth, those who place their hopes in You, -
nothing of the world can touch them at all. ||1||Pause||
Those whose hearts are filled with their Lord and Master -
no anxiety can affect them. ||2||
Those, unto whom You give Your consolation, God -
pain does not even approach them. ||3||
Says Nanak, I have found that Guru,
who has shown me the Perfect, Supreme Lord God. ||4||41||110||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
This human body is so difficult to obtain; it is only obtained by great good fortune.
Those who do not meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are murderers of the soul. ||1||
Those who forget the Lord might just as well die.
Without the Naam, of what use are their lives? ||1||Pause||
Eating, drinking, playing, laughing and showing off -
what use are the ostentatious displays of the dead? ||2||
Those who do not listen to the Praises of the Lord of supreme bliss,
are worse off than beasts, birds or creeping creatures. ||3||
Says Nanak, the GurMantra has been implanted within me;
the Name alone is contained within my heart. ||4||42||111||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Whose mother is this? Whose father is this?
They are relatives in name only- they are all false. ||1||
Why are you screaming and shouting, you fool?
By good destiny and the Lord's Order, you have come into the world. ||1||Pause||
There is the one dust, the one light,
the one praanic wind. Why are you crying? For whom do you cry? ||2||
People weep and cry out, "Mine, mine!
This soul is not perishable. ||3||
Says Nanak, the Guru has opened my shutters;
I am liberated, and my doubts have been dispelled. ||4||43||112||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Those who seem to be great and powerful,
are afflicted by the disease of anxiety. ||1||
Who is great by the greatness of Maya?
They alone are great, who are lovingly attached to the Lord. ||1||Pause||
The landlord fights over his land each day.
He shall have to leave it in the end, and yet his desire is still not satisfied. ||2||
Says Nanak, this is the essence of Truth:
without the Lord's meditation, there is no salvation. ||3||44||113||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Perfect is the path; perfect is the cleansing bath.
Everything is perfect, if the Naam is in the heart. ||1||
One's honor remains perfect, when the Perfect Lord preserves it.
His servant takes to the Sanctuary of the Supreme Lord God. ||1||Pause||
Perfect is the peace; perfect is the contentment.
Perfect is the penance; perfect is the Raja Yoga, the Yoga of meditation and success. ||2||
On the Lord's Path, sinners are purified.
Perfect is their glory; perfect is their humanity. ||3||
They dwell forever in the Presence of the Creator Lord.
Says Nanak, my True Guru is Perfect. ||4||45||114||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Millions of sins are wiped away by the dust of the feet of the Saints.
