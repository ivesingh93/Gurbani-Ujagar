One who remains forever imbued with His Love, night and day - in His Mercy, the Lord inspires him to perform devotional worship service. ||6||
In this temple of the mind, the mind wanders around.
Discarding joy like straw, it suffers in terrible pain.
Without meeting the True Guru, it finds no place of rest; He Himself has staged this play. ||7||
He Himself is infinite; He contemplates Himself.
He Himself bestows Union through actions of excellence.
What can the poor creatures do? Granting forgiveness, He unites them with Himself. ||8||
The Perfect Lord Himself unites them with the True Guru.
Through the True Word of the Shabad, he makes them brave spiritual heroes.
Uniting them with Himself, He bestows glorious greatness; He inspires them to focus their consciousness on the True Lord. ||9||
The True Lord is deep within the heart.
How rare are those who, as Gurmukh, realize this.
The treasure of the Naam abides deep within their hearts; they meditate on the Naam with their tongues. ||10||
He wanders through foreign lands, but does not look within himself.
Attached to Maya, he is bound and gagged by the Messenger of Death.

There is no real chanting, meditation, penance or self-control,

Emotional attachment to Maya rules deep within all.
When one realizes the One who created him, emotional attachment to Maya is dispelled. ||14||
Some are engrossed in emotional attachment to Maya and pride.
They are self-conceited and egotistical.
They never think about the Messenger of Death; in the end, they leave, regretting and repenting. ||15||
He alone knows the Way, who created it.
The Gurmukh, who is blessed with the Shabad, realizes Him.
Slave Nanak offers this prayer; O Lord, let my consciousness be attached to the True Name. ||16||2||16||
Maaroo, Third Mehl:
From the very beginning of time, and throughout the ages, the Merciful Lord has been the Great Giver.
Through the Shabad, the Word of the Perfect Guru, He is realized.
Those who serve You are immersed in You. You unite them in Union with Yourself. ||1||
You are inaccessible and unfathomable; Your limits cannot be found.
All beings and creatures seek Your Sanctuary.
As is pleases Your Will, You guide us along; You Yourself place us on the Path. ||2||
The True Lord is, and shall always be.
He Himself creates - there is no other at all.
The Giver of peace takes care of all; He Himself sustains them. ||3||
You are inaccessible, unfathomable, invisible and infinite;
no one knows Your extent.
You Yourself realize Yourself. Through the Guru's Teachings, You reveal Yourself. ||4||
