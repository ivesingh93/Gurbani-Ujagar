In the Fear of God, You enjoy the Fearless Lord; among the thousands of beings, You see the Unseen Lord.
Through the True Guru, You have realized the state of the Inaccessible, Unfathomable, Profound Lord.
Meeting with the Guru, You are certified and approved; You practice Yoga in the midst of wealth and power.
Blessed, blessed, blessed is the Guru, who has filled to overflowing the pools which were empty.
Reaching up to the certified Guru, You endure the unendurable; You are immersed in the pool of contentment.
So speaks KALL: O Guru Arjun, You have intuitively attained the state of Yoga within Yourself. ||8||
Nectar drips from Your tongue, and Your mouth gives Blessings, O Incomprehensible and Infinite Spiritual Hero. O Guru, the Word of Your Shabad eradicates egotism.
You have overpowered the five enticers, and established with intuitive ease the Absolute Lord within Your own being.
Attached to the Lord's Name, the world is saved; enshrine the True Guru within your heart.
So speaks KALL: O Guru Arjun, You have illluminated the highest pinnacle of wisdom. ||9||
Sorat'h
: Guru Arjun is the certified Primal Person; like Arjuna, He never leaves the field of battle.
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is His spear and insignia. He is embellished with the Shabad, the Word of the True Guru. ||1||
The Lord's Name is the Boat, the Bridge to cross over the terrifying world-ocean.
You are in love with the True Guru; attached to the Naam, You have saved the world. ||2||
The Naam is the Saving Grace of the world; by the Pleasure of the True Guru, it is obtained.
Now, I am not concerned with anything else; at Your Door, I am fulfilled. ||3||12||
The Embodiment of Light, the Lord Himself is called Guru Nanak.
From Him, came Guru Angad; His essence was absorbed into the essence.
Guru Angad showed His Mercy, and established Amar Daas as the True Guru.
Guru Amar Daas blessed Guru Raam Daas with the umbrella of immortality.
So speaks Mat'huraa: gazing upon the Blessed Vision, the Darshan of Guru Raam Daas, His speech became as sweet as nectar.
With your eyes, see the certified Primal Person, Guru Arjun, the Fifth Manifestation of the Guru. ||1||
He is the Embodiment of Truth; He has enshrined the True Name, Sat Naam, Truth and contentment within His heart.
From the very beginning, the Primal Being has written this destiny upon His forehead.
His Divine Light shines forth, dazzling and radiant; His Glorious Grandeur pervades the realms of the world.
Meeting the Guru, touching the Philosopher's Stone, He was acclaimed as Guru.
So speaks Mat'huraa: I constantly focus my consciousness on Him; as sunmukh, I look to Him.
In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, Guru Arjun is the Boat; attached to him, the entire universe is safely carried across. ||2||
I beg from that humble being who is known all over the world, who lives in, and loves the Name, night and day.
He is supremely unattached, and imbued with the Love of the Transcendent Lord; he is free of desire, but he lives as a family man.
He is dedicated to the Love of the Infinite, Limitless Primal Lord God; he has no concerns for any other pleasure, except for the Lord God.
Guru Arjun is the All-pervading Lord God of Mat'huraa. Devoted to His Worship, he remains attached to the Lord's Feet. ||3||
