Bilaaval, Fourth Mehl, Ashtapadees, Eleventh House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
One who eliminates his self-centeredness, and eradicates his ego, night and day sings the songs of the Lord's Love.
The Gurmukh is inspired, his body is golden, and his light merges into the Light of the Fearless Lord. ||1||
I take the Support of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
I cannot live, for a moment, even for an instant, without the Name of the Lord; the Gurmukh reads the Sermon of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||Pause||
In the one house of the body, there are ten gates; night and day, the five thieves break in.
They steal the entire wealth of one's Dharmic faith, but the blind, self-willed manmukh does not know it. ||2||
The fortress of the body is overflowing with gold and jewels; when it is awakened by spiritual wisdom, one enshrines love for the essence of reality.
The thieves and robbers hide out in the body; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they are arrested and locked up. ||3||
The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is the boat, and the Word of the Guru's Shabad is the boatman, to carry us across.
The Messenger of Death, the tax collector, does not even come close, and no thieves or robbers can plunder you. ||4||
I continuously sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, day and night; singing the Lord's Praises, I cannot find His limits.
The mind of the Gurmukh returns to its own home; it meets the Lord of the Universe, to the beat of the celestial drum. ||5||
Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan with my eyes, my mind is satisfied; with my ears, I listen to the Guru's Bani, and the Word of His Shabad.
Listening, listening, my soul is softened, delighted by His subtle essence, chanting the Name of the Lord of the Universe. ||6||
In the grip of the three qualities, they are engrossed in love and attachment to Maya; only as Gurmukh do they find the absolute quality, absorption in bliss.
With a single, impartial eye, look upon all alike, and see God pervading all. ||7||
The Light of the Lord's Name permeates all; the Gurmukh knows the unknowable.
O Nanak, the Lord has become merciful to the meek; through loving adoration, he merges in the Lord's Name. ||8||1||4||
Bilaaval, Fourth Mehl:
Meditate on the cool water of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. Perfume yourself with the fragrant scent of the Lord, the sandalwood tree.
