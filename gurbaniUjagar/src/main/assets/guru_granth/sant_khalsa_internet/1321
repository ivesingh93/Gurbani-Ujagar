Kalyaan, Fourth Mehl:
O God, Treasure of Mercy, please bless me, that I may sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
I always place my hopes in You; O God, when will you take me in Your Embrace? ||1||Pause||
I am a foolish and ignorant child; Father, please teach me!
Your child makes mistakes again and again, but still, You are pleased with him, O Father of the Universe. ||1||
Whatever You give me, O my Lord and Master - that is what I receive.
There is no other place where I can go. ||2||
Those devotees who are pleasing to the Lord - the Lord is pleasing to them.
Their light merges into the Light; the lights are merged and blended together. ||3||
The Lord Himself has shown mercy; He lovingly attunes me to Himself.
Servant Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Door of the Lord, who protects his honor. ||4||6|| One Chhakaa||
Kalyaan Bhopaalee, Fourth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O Supreme Lord God, Transcendent Lord and Master, Destroyer of pain, Transcendental Lord God.
All Your devotees beg of You. Ocean of peace, carry us across the terrifying world-ocean; You are the Wish-fulfilling Jewel. ||1||Pause||
Merciful to the meek and poor, Lord of the world, Support of the earth, Inner-knower, Searcher of hearts, Lord of the Universe.
Those who meditate on the Supreme Lord become fearless. Through the Wisdom of the Guru's Teachings, they meditate on the Lord, the Liberator Lord. ||1||
Those who come to Sanctuary at the Feet of the Lord of the Universe - those humble beings cross over the terrifying world-ocean.
The Lord preserves the honor of His humble devotees; O servant Nanak, the Lord Himself showers them with His Grace. ||2||1||7||
Raag Kalyaan, Fifth Mehl, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Please grant me this blessing:
May the bumble-bee of my mind be immersed again and again in the Honey of Your Lotus Feet. ||1||Pause||
I am not concerned with any other water; please bless this songbird with a Drop of Your Water, Lord. ||1||
Unless I meet my Lord, I am not satisfied. Nanak lives, gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. ||2||1||
Kalyaan, Fifth Mehl:
This beggar begs and begs for Your Name, Lord.
You are the Support of all, the Master of all, the Giver of absolute peace. ||1||Pause||
So many, so very many, beg for charity at Your Door; they receive only what You are pleased to give. ||1||
Fruitful, fruitful, fruitful is the Blessed Vision of His Darshan; touching His Touch, I sing His Glorious Praises.
O Nanak, one's essence is blended into the Essence; the diamond of the mind is pierced through by the Diamond of the Lord. ||2||2||
