The world is a game, O Kabeer, so throw the dice consciously. ||3||1||23||
Aasaa:
I make my body the dying vat, and within it, I dye my mind. I make the five elements my marriage guests.
I take my marriage vows with the Lord, my King; my soul is imbued with His Love. ||1||
Sing, sing, O brides of the Lord, the marriage songs of the Lord.
The Lord, my King, has come to my house as my Husband. ||1||Pause||
Within the lotus of my heart, I have made my bridal pavilion, and I have spoken the wisdom of God.
I have obtained the Lord King as my Husband - such is my great good fortune. ||2||
The angles, holy men, silent sages, and the 330,000,000 deities have come in their heavenly chariots to see this spectacle.
Says Kabeer, I have been taken in marriage by the One Supreme Being, the Lord God. ||3||2||24||
Aasaa:
I am bothered by my mother-in-law, Maya, and loved by my father-in-law, the Lord. I fear even the name of my husband's elder brother, Death.
O my mates and companions, my husband's sister, misunderstanding has seized me, and I am burning with the pain of separation from my husband's younger brother, divine knowledge. ||1||
My mind has gone insane, since I forgot the Lord. How can I lead a virtuous lifestyle?
He rests in the bed of my mind, but I cannot see Him with my eyes. Unto whom should I tell my sufferings? ||1||Pause||
My step-father, egotism, fights with me, and my mother, desire, is always intoxicated.
When I stayed with my elder brother, meditation, then I was loved by my Husband Lord. ||2||
Says Kabeer, the five passions argue with me, and in these arguments, my life is wasting away.
The false Maya has bound the whole world, but I have obtained peace, chanting the Name of the Lord. ||3||3||25||
Aasaa:
In my house, I constantly weave the thread, while you wear the thread around your neck, O Brahmin.
You read the Vedas and sacred hymns, while I have enshrined the Lord of the Universe in my heart. ||1||
Upon my tongue, within my eyes, and within my heart, abides the Lord, the Lord of the Universe.
When you are interrogated at Death's door, O mad-man, what will you say then? ||1||Pause||
I am a cow, and You are the herdsman, the Sustainer of the World. You are my Saving Grace, lifetime after lifetime.
You have never taken me across to graze there - what sort of a herdsman are You? ||2||
You are a Brahmin, and I am a weaver of Benares; can You understand my wisdom?
You beg from emperors and kings, while I meditate on the Lord. ||3||4||26||
Aasaa:
The life of the world is only a dream; life is just a dream.
Believing it to be true, I grasped at it, and abandoned the supreme treasure. ||1||
O Father, I have enshrined love and affection for Maya,
which has taken the jewel of spiritual wisdom away from me. ||1||Pause||
The moth sees with its eyes, but it still becomes entangled; the insect does not see the fire.
Attached to gold and woman, the fool does not think of the noose of Death. ||2||
Reflect upon this, and abandon sin; the Lord is a boat to carry you across.
Says Kabeer, such is the Lord, the Life of the World; there is no one equal to Him. ||3||5||27||
Aasaa:
In the past, I have taken many forms, but I shall not take form again.
