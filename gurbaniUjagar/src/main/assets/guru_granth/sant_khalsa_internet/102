The servant of the Lord and Master enjoys the Love and Affection of the Lord.
That which belongs to the Lord and Master, belongs to His servant. The servant becomes distinguished in association with his Lord and Master. ||3||
He, whom the Lord and Master dresses in the robes of honor,
is not called to answer for his account any longer.
Nanak is a sacrifice to that servant. He is the pearl of the deep and unfathomable Ocean of God. ||4||18||25||
Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
Everything is within the home of the self; there is nothing beyond.
One who searches outside is deluded by doubt.
By Guru's Grace, one who has found the Lord within is happy, inwardly and outwardly. ||1||
Slowly, gently, drop by drop, the stream of nectar trickles down within.
The mind drinks it in, hearing and reflecting on the Word of the Shabad.
It enjoys bliss and ecstasy day and night, and plays with the Lord forever and ever. ||2||
I have now been united with the Lord after having been separated and cut off from Him for so many lifetimes;
by the Grace of the Holy Saint, the dried-up branches have blossomed forth again in their greenery.
I have obtained this sublime understanding, and I meditate on the Naam; as Gurmukh, I have met the Lord. ||3||
As the waves of water merge again with the water,
so does my light merge again into the Light.
Says Nanak, the veil of illusion has been cut away, and I shall not go out wandering any more. ||4||19||26||
Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
I am a sacrifice to those who have heard of You.
I am a sacrifice to those whose tongues speak of You.
Again and again, I am a sacrifice to those who meditate on You with mind and body. ||1||
I wash the feet of those who walk upon Your Path.
With my eyes, I long to behold those kind people.
I offer my mind to those friends, who have met the Guru and found God. ||2||
Very fortunate are those who know You.
In the midst of all, they remain detached and balanced in Nirvaanaa.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, they cross over the terrifying world-ocean, and conquer all their evil passions. ||3||
My mind has entered their Sanctuary.
I have renounced my pride in my own strength, and the darkness of emotional attachment.
Please bless Nanak with the Gift of the Naam, the Name of the Inaccessible and Unfathomable God. ||4||20||27||
Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
You are the tree; Your branches have blossomed forth.
From the very small and subtle, You have become huge and manifest.
You are the Ocean of Water, and You are the foam and the bubbles on its surface. I cannot see any other except You, Lord. ||1||
You are the thread, and You are also the beads.
You are the knot, and You are the primary bead of the maalaa.
In the beginning, in the middle and in the end, there is God. I cannot see any other except You, Lord. ||2||
You transcend all qualities, and You possess the supreme qualities. You are the Giver of peace.
You are detached in Nirvaanaa, and You are the Enjoyer, imbued with love.
You Yourself know Your Own Ways; You dwell upon Yourself. ||3||
You are the Master, and then again, You are the servant.
O God, You Yourself are the Manifest and the Unmanifest.
Slave Nanak sings Your Glorious Praises forever. Please, just for a moment, bless him with Your Glance of Grace. ||4||21||28||
