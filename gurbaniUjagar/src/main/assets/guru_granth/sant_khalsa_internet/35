The life of the self-willed manmukh passes uselessly. What face will he show when he passes beyond? ||3||
God Himself is everything; those who are in their ego cannot even speak of this.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, He is realized, and the pain of egotism is eradicated from within.
I fall at the feet of those who serve their True Guru.
O Nanak, I am a sacrifice to those who are found to be true in the True Court. ||4||21||54||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Consider the time and the moment-when should we worship the Lord?
Night and day, one who is attuned to the Name of the True Lord is true.
If someone forgets the Beloved Lord, even for an instant, what sort of devotion is that?
One whose mind and body are cooled and soothed by the True Lord-no breath of his is wasted. ||1||
O my mind, meditate on the Name of the Lord.
True devotional worship is performed when the Lord comes to dwell in the mind. ||1||Pause||
With intuitive ease, cultivate your farm, and plant the Seed of the True Name.
The seedlings have sprouted luxuriantly, and with intuitive ease, the mind is satisfied.
The Word of the Guru's Shabad is Ambrosial Nectar; drinking it in, thirst is quenched.
This true mind is attuned to Truth, and it remains permeated with the True One. ||2||
In speaking, in seeing and in words, remain immersed in the Shabad.
The Word of the Guru's Bani vibrates throughout the four ages. As Truth, it teaches Truth.
Egotism and possessiveness are eliminated, and the True One absorbs them into Himself.
Those who remain lovingly absorbed in the True One see the Mansion of His Presence close at hand. ||3||
By His Grace, we meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Without His Mercy, it cannot be obtained.
Through perfect good destiny, one finds the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, and one comes to meet the True Guru.
Night and day, remain attuned to the Naam, and the pain of corruption shall be dispelled from within.
O Nanak, merging with the Shabad through the Name, one is immersed in the Name. ||4||22||55||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Those who contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad are filled with the Fear of God.
They remain forever merged with the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation; they dwell upon the Glories of the True One.
They cast off the filth of their mental duality, and they keep the Lord enshrined in their hearts.
True is their speech, and true are their minds. They are in love with the True One. ||1||
O my mind, you are filled with the filth of egotism.
The Immaculate Lord is eternally Beautiful. We are adorned with the Word of the Shabad. ||1||Pause||
God joins to Himself those whose minds are fascinated with the True Word of His Shabad.
Night and day, they are attuned to the Naam, and their light is absorbed into the Light.
Through His Light, God is revealed. Without the True Guru, understanding is not obtained.
The True Guru comes to meet those who have such pre-ordained destiny. ||2||
Without the Name, all are miserable. In the love of duality, they are ruined.
Without Him, I cannot survive even for an instant, and my life-night passes in anguish.
Wandering in doubt, the spiritually blind come and go in reincarnation, over and over again.
When God Himself bestows His Glance of Grace, He blends us into Himself. ||3||
