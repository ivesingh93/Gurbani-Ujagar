Says Kabeer, I have searched the skIEs,
and have not seen another, equal to the Lord. ||2||34||
Gauree, Kabeer Jee:
That head which was once embellished with the finest turban -
upon that head, the crow now cleans his beak. ||1||
What pride should we take in this body and wealth?
Why not hold tight to the Lord's Name instead? ||1||Pause||
Says Kabeer, listen, O my mind:
this may be your fate as well! ||2||35||
Thirty-Five Steps Of Gauree Gwaarayree. ||
Raag Gauree Gwaarayree, Ashtapadees Of Kabeer Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
People beg for pleasure, but pain comes instead.
I would rather not beg for that pleasure. ||1||
People are involved in corruption, but still, they hope for pleasure.
How will they find their home in the Sovereign Lord King? ||1||Pause||
Even Shiva and Brahma are afraid of this pleasure,
but I have judged that pleasure to be true. ||2||
Even sages like Sanak and Naarad, and the thousand-headed serpent,
did not see the mind within the body. ||3||
Anyone can search for this mind, O Siblings of Destiny.
When it escapes from the body, where does the mind go? ||4||
By Guru's Grace, Jai Dayv and Naam Dayv
came to know this, through loving devotional worship of the Lord. ||5||
This mind does not come or go.
One whose doubt is dispelled, knows the Truth. ||6||
This mind has no form or outline.
By God's Command it was created; understanding God's Command, it will be absorbed into Him again. ||7||
Does anyone know the secret of this mind?
This mind shall merge into the Lord, the Giver of peace and pleasure. ||8||
There is One Soul, and it pervades all bodies.
Kabeer dwells upon this Mind. ||9||1||36||
Gauree Gwaarayree:
Those who are awake to the One Name, day and night -
many of them have become Siddhas - perfect spiritual beings - with their consciousness attuned to the Lord. ||1||Pause||
The seekers, the Siddhas and the silent sages have all lost the game.
The One Name is the wish-fulfilling Elysian Tree, which saves them and carries them across. ||1||
Those who are rejuvenated by the Lord, do not belong to any other.
Says Kabeer, they realize the Name of the Lord. ||2||37||
Gauree And Also Sorat'h:
O shameless being, don't you feel ashamed?
You have forsaken the Lord - now where will you go? Unto whom will you turn? ||1||Pause||
One whose Lord and Master is the highest and most exalted -
it is not proper for him to go to the house of another. ||1||
That Lord and Master is pervading everywhere.
The Lord is always with us; He is never far away. ||2||
Even Maya takes to the Sanctuary of His Lotus Feet.
Tell me, what is there which is not in His home? ||3||
Everyone speaks of Him; He is All-powerful.
He is His Own Master; He is the Giver. ||4||
Says Kabeer, he alone is perfect in this world,
in whose heart there is none other than the Lord. ||5||38||
Whose son is he? Whose father is he?
