Why do you not worship and adore Him? Join together with the Holy Saints; any instant, your time shall come.
All your property and wealth, and all that you see - none of it will go along with you.
Says Nanak, worship and adore the Lord, Har, Har. What praise, and what approval, can I offer to Him? ||2||
I ask the Saints, what is my Lord and Master like?
I offer my heart, to one who brings me news of Him.
Give me news of my Dear God; where does the Enticer live?
He is the Giver of peace to life and limb; God is totally permeating all places, interspaces and countries.
He is liberated from bondage, joined to each and every heart. I cannot say what the Lord is like.
Gazing upon His wondrous play, O Nanak, my mind is fascinated. I humbly ask, what is my Lord and Master like? ||3||
In His Kindness, He has come to His humble servant.
Blessed is that heart, in which the Lord's Feet are enshrined.
His Feet are enshrined within, in the Society of the Saints; the darkness of ignorance is dispelled.
The heart is enlightened and illumined and enraptured; God has been found.
Pain is gone, and peace has come to my house. The ultimate intuitive peace prevails.
Says Nanak, I have found the Perfect Lord; in His Kindness, He has come to His humble servant. ||4||1||
Vaar Of Saarang, Fourth Mehl, To Be Sung To The Tune Of Mehma-Hasna:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Shalok, Second Mehl:
The key of the Guru opens the lock of attachment, in the house of the mind, under the roof of the body.
O Nanak, without the Guru, the door of the mind cannot be opened. No one else holds the key in hand. ||1||
First Mehl:
He is not won over by music, songs or the Vedas.
He is not won over by intuitive wisdom, meditation or Yoga.
He is not won over by feeling sad and depressed forever.
He is not won over by beauty, wealth and pleasures.
He is not won over by wandering naked at sacred shrines.
He is not won over by giving donations in charity.
He is not won over by living alone in the wilderness.
He is not won over by fighting and dying as a warrior in battle.
He is not won over by becoming the dust of the masses.
The account is written of the loves of the mind.
O Nanak, the Lord is won over only by His Name. ||2||
First Mehl:
You may study the nine grammars, the six Shaastras and the six divisions of the Vedas.
You may recite the Mahaabhaarata.
Even these cannot find the limits of the Lord.
Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, how can anyone be liberated?
Brahma, in the lotus of the navel, does not know the limits of God.
The Gurmukh, O Nanak, realizes the Naam. ||3||
Pauree:
The Immaculate Lord Himself, by Himself, created Himself.
He Himself created the whole drama of all the world's play.
He Himself formed the three gunas, the three qualities; He increased the attachment to Maya.
By Guru's Grace, they are saved - those who love the Will of God.
O Nanak, the True Lord is pervading everywhere; all are contained within the True Lord. ||1||
