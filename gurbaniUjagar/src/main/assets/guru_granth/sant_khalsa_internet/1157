Bhairao, The Word Of The Devotees,
Kabeer Jee, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The Name of the Lord - this alone is my wealth.
I do not tie it up to hide it, nor do I sell it to make my living. ||1||Pause||
The Name is my crop, and the Name is my field.
As Your humble servant, I perform devotional worship to You; I seek Your Sanctuary. ||1||
The Name is Maya and wealth for me; the Name is my capital.
I do not forsake You; I do not know any other at all. ||2||
The Name is my family, the Name is my brother.
The Name is my companion, who will help me in the end. ||3||
One whom the Lord keeps detached from Maya-
says Kabeer, I am his slave. ||4||1||
Naked we come, and naked we go.
No one, not even the kings and queens, shall remain. ||1||
