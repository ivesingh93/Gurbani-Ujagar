Let your work be restraint from sin; only then will people call you blessed.
O Nanak, the Lord shall look upon you with His Glance of Grace, and you shall be blessed with honor four times over. ||4||2||
Sorat'h, First Mehl, Chau-Tukas:
The son is dear to his mother and father; he is the wise son-in-law to his father-in-law.
The father is dear to his son and daughter, and the brother is very dear to his brother.
By the Order of the Lord's Command, he leaves his house and goes outside, and in an instant, everything becomes alien to him.
The self-willed manmukh does not remember the Name of the Lord, does not give in charity, and does not cleanse his consciousness; his body rolls in the dust. ||1||
The mind is comforted by the Comforter of the Naam.
I fall at the Guru's feet - I am a sacrifice to Him; He has given me to understand the true understanding. ||Pause||
The mind is impressed with the false love of the world; he quarrels with the Lord's humble servant.
Infatuated with Maya, night and day, he sees only the worldly path; he does not chant the Naam, and drinking poison, he dies.
He is imbued and infatuated with vicious talk; the Word of the Shabad does not come into his consciousness.
He is not imbued with the Lord's Love, and he is not impressed by the taste of the Name; the self-willed manmukh loses his honor. ||2||
He does not enjoy celestial peace in the Company of the Holy, and there is not even a bit of sweetness on his tongue.
He calls his mind, body and wealth his own; he has no knowledge of the Court of the Lord.
Closing his eyes, he walks in darkness; he cannot see the home of his own being, O Siblings of Destiny.
Tied up at Death's door, he finds no place of rest; he receives the rewards of his own actions. ||3||
When the Lord casts His Glance of Grace, then I see Him with my own eyes; He is indescribable, and cannot be described.
With my ears, I continually listen to the Word of the Shabad, and I praise Him; His Ambrosial Name abides within my heart.
He is Fearless, Formless and absolutely without vengeance; I am absorbed in His Perfect Light.
O Nanak, without the Guru, doubt is not dispelled; through the True Name, glorious greatness is obtained. ||4||3||
Sorat'h, First Mehl, Du-Tukas:
In the realm of land, and in the realm of water, Your seat is the chamber of the four directions.
Yours is the one and only form of the entire universe; Your mouth is the mint to fashion all. ||1||
O my Lord Master, Your play is so wonderful!
You are pervading and permeating the water, the land and the sky; You Yourself are contained in all. ||Pause||
Wherever I look, there I see Your Light, but what is Your form?
You have one form, but it is unseen; there is none like any other. ||2||
The beings born of eggs, born of the womb, born of the earth and born of sweat, all are created by You.
I have seen one glory of Yours, that You are pervading and permeating in all. ||3||
Your Glories are so numerous, and I do not know even one of them; I am such a fool - please, give me some of them!
Prays Nanak, listen, O my Lord Master: I am sinking like a stone - please, save me! ||4||4||
Sorat'h, First Mehl:
I am a wicked sinner and a great hypocrite; You are the Immaculate and Formless Lord.
Tasting the Ambrosial Nectar, I am imbued with supreme bliss; O Lord and Master, I seek Your Sanctuary. ||1||
O Creator Lord, You are the honor of the dishonored.
In my lap is the honor and glory of the wealth of the Name; I merge into the True Word of the Shabad. ||Pause||
You are perfect, while I am worthless and imperfect. You are profound, while I am trivial.
