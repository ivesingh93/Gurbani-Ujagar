Night and day, they remain in the Fear of God; conquering their fears, their doubts are dispelled. ||5||
Dispelling their doubts, they find a lasting peace.
By Guru's Grace, the supreme status is attained.
Deep within, they are pure, and their words are pure as well; intuitively, they sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||6||
They recite the Simritees, the Shaastras and the Vedas,
but deluded by doubt, they do not understand the essence of reality.
Without serving the True Guru, they find no peace; they earn only pain and misery. ||7||
The Lord Himself acts; unto whom should we complain?
How can anyone complain that the Lord has made a mistake?
O Nanak, the Lord Himself does, and causes things to be done; chanting the Naam, we are absorbed in the Naam. ||8||7||8||
Maajh, Third Mehl:
He Himself imbues us with His Love, with effortless ease.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, we are dyed in the color of the Lord's Love.
This mind and body are so imbued, and this tongue is dyed in the deep crimson color of the poppy. Through the Love and the Fear of God, we are dyed in this color. ||1||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who enshrine the Fearless Lord within their minds.
By Guru's Grace, I meditate on the Fearless Lord; the Shabad has carried me across the poisonous world-ocean. ||1||Pause||
The idiotic self-willed manmukhs try to be clever,
but in spite of their bathing and washing, they shall not be acceptable.
As they came, so shall they go, regretting the mistakes they made. ||2||
The blind, self-willed manmukhs do not understand anything;
death was pre-ordained for them when they came into the world, but they do not understand.
The self-willed manmukhs may practice religious rituals, but they do not obtain the Name; without the Name, they lose this life in vain. ||3||
The practice of Truth is the essence of the Shabad.
Through the Perfect Guru, the gate of salvation is found.
So, night and day, listen to the Word of the Guru's Bani, and the Shabad. Let yourself be colored by this love. ||4||
The tongue, imbued with the Lord's Essence, delights in His Love.
My mind and body are enticed by the Lord's Sublime Love.
I have easily obtained my Darling Beloved; I am intuitively absorbed in celestial peace. ||5||
Those who have the Lord's Love within, sing His Glorious Praises;
through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they are intuitively absorbed in celestial peace.
I am forever a sacrifice to those who dedicate their consciousness to the Guru's Service. ||6||
The True Lord is pleased with Truth, and only Truth.
By Guru's Grace, one's inner being is deeply imbued with His Love.
Sitting in that blessed place, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, who Himself inspires us to accept His Truth. ||7||
That one, upon whom the Lord casts His Glance of Grace, obtains it.
By Guru's Grace, egotism departs.
O Nanak, that one, within whose mind the Name dwells, is honored in the True Court. ||8||8||9||
Maajh Third Mehl:
Serving the True Guru is the greatest greatness.
The Dear Lord automatically comes to dwell in the mind.
The Dear Lord is the fruit-bearing tree; drinking in the Ambrosial Nectar, thirst is quenched. ||1||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to the one who leads me to join the True Congregation.
The Lord Himself unites me with the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
