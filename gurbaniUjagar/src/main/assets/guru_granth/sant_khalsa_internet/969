Cut up desire, sexuality, anger, pride and envy, and let them be the fermenting bark. ||1||
Is there any Saint, with intuitive peace and poise deep within, unto whom I might offer my meditation and austerities as payment?
I dedicate my body and mind to whoever gives me even a drop of this wine from such a vat. ||1||Pause||
I have made the fourteen worlds the furnace, and I have burnt my body with the fire of God.
My mudra - my hand-gesture, is the pipe; tuning into the celestial sound current within, the Shushmanaa - the central spinal channel, is my cooling pad. ||2||
Pilgrimages, fasting, vows, purifications, self-discipline, austerities and breath control through the sun and moon channels - all these I pledge.
My focused consciousness is the cup, and the Ambrosial Nectar is the pure juice. I drink in the supreme, sublime essence of this juice. ||3||
The pure stream constantly trickles forth, and my mind is intoxicated by this sublime essence.
Says Kabeer, all other wines are trivial and tasteless; this is the only true, sublime essence. ||4||1||
Make spiritual wisdom the molasses, meditation the flowers, and the Fear of God the fire enshrined in your mind.
The Shushmanaa, the central spinal channel, is intuitively balanced, and the drinker drinks in this wine. ||1||
O hermit Yogi, my mind is intoxicated.
When that wine rises up, one tastes the sublime essence of this juice, and sees across the three worlds. ||1||Pause||
Joining the two channels of the breath, I have lit the furnace, and I drink in the supreme, sublime essence.
I have burnt both sexual desire and anger, and I have been emancipated from the world. ||2||
The light of spiritual wisdom enlightens me; meeting with the Guru, the True Guru, I have obtained this understanding.
Slave Kabeer is intoxicated with that wine, which never wears off. ||3||2||
You are my Sumayr Mountain, O my Lord and Master; I have grasped Your Support.
You do not shake, and I do not fall. You have preserved my honor. ||1||
Now and then, here and there, You, only You.
By Your Grace, I am forever in peace. ||1||Pause||
Relying upon You, I can live even in the cursed place of Magahar; You have put out the fire of my body.
First, I obtained the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan in Magahar; then, I came to dwell at Benares. ||2||
As is Magahar, so is Benares; I see them as one and the same.
I am poor, but I have obtained this wealth of the Lord; the proud are bursting with pride, and die. ||3||
One who takes pride in himself is stuck with thorns; no one can pull them out.
Here, he cries bitterly, and hereafter, he burns in the most hideous hell. ||4||
What is hell, and what is heaven? The Saints reject them both.
I have no obligation to either of them, by the Grace of my Guru. ||5||
Now, I have mounted to the throne of the Lord; I have met the Lord, the Sustainer of the World.
The Lord and Kabeer have become one. No one can tell them apart. ||6||3||
I honor and obey the Saints, and punish the wicked; this is my duty as God's police officer.
Day and night, I wash Your feet, Lord; I wave my hair as the chauree, to brush away the flies. ||1||
I am a dog at Your Court, Lord.
I open my snout and bark before it. ||1||Pause||
