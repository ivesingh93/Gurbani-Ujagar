are all in the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, the Support of the soul and the breath of life.
I have obtained the true wealth of the Lord's Love.
I have crossed over the treacherous world-ocean in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||3||
Sit in peace, O Saints, with the family of friends.
Earn the wealth of the Lord, which is beyond estimation.
He alone obtains it, unto whom the Guru has bestowed it.
O Nanak, no one shall go away empty-handed. ||4||27||96||
Gauree Gwaarayree, Fifth Mehl:
The hands are sanctified instantly,
and the entanglements of Maya are dispelled.
Repeat constantly with your tongue the Glorious Praises of the Lord,
and you shall find peace, O my friends, O Siblings of Destiny. ||1||
With pen and ink, write upon your paper
the Name of the Lord, the Ambrosial Word of the Lord's Bani. ||1||Pause||
By this act, your sins shall be washed away.
Remembering the Lord in meditation, you shall not be punished by the Messenger of Death.
The couriers of the Righteous Judge of Dharma shall not touch you.
The intoxication of Maya shall not entice you at all. ||2||
You shall be redeemed, and through you, the whole world shall be saved,
if you chant the Name of the One and Only Lord.
Practice this yourself, and teach others;
instill the Lord's Name in your heart. ||3||
That person, who has this treasure upon his forehead -
that person meditates on God.
Twenty-four hours a day, chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord, Har, Har.
Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to Him. ||4||28||97||
Raag Gauree Gwaarayree, Fifth Mehl, Chau-Padas, Du-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
That which belongs to another - he claims as his own.
That which he must abandon - to that, his mind is attracted. ||1||
Tell me, how can he meet the Lord of the World?
That which is forbidden - with that, he is in love. ||1||Pause||
That which is false - he deems as true.
That which is true - his mind is not attached to that at all. ||2||
He takes the crooked path of the unrighteous way;
leaving the straight and narrow path, he weaves his way backwards. ||3||
God is the Lord and Master of both worlds.
He, whom the Lord unites with Himself, O Nanak, is liberated. ||4||29||98||
Gauree Gwaarayree, Fifth Mehl:
In the Dark Age of Kali Yuga, they come together through destiny.
As long as the Lord commands, they enjoy their pleasures. ||1||
By burning oneself, the Beloved Lord is not obtained.
Only by the actions of destiny does she rise up and burn herself, as a 'satee'. ||1||Pause||
Imitating what she sees, with her stubborn mind-set, she goes into the fire.
She does not obtain the Company of her Beloved Lord, and she wanders through countless incarnations. ||2||
With pure conduct and self-restraint, she surrenders to her Husband Lord's Will;
that woman shall not suffer pain at the hands of the Messenger of Death. ||3||
Says Nanak, she who looks upon the Transcendent Lord as her Husband,
is the blessed 'satee'; she is received with honor in the Court of the Lord. ||4||30||99||
Gauree Gwaarayree, Fifth Mehl:
I am prosperous and fortunate, for I have received the True Name.
I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, with natural, intuitive ease. ||1||Pause||
