Joining the Society of the Saints, I have obtained the supreme status. I am just a castor-oil tree, made fragrant by their association. ||1||
Meditate on the Lord of the Universe, the Master of the world, the Lord of creation.
Those humble beings who seek the Lord's Sanctuary are saved, like Prahlaad; they are emancipated and merge with the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Of all plants, the sandalwood tree is the most sublime. Everything near the sandalwood tree becomes fragrant like sandalwood.
The stubborn, false faithless cynics are dried up; their egotistical pride separates them far from the Lord. ||2||
Only the Creator Lord Himself knows the state and condition of everyone; the Lord Himself makes all the arrangements.
One who meets the True Guru is transformed into gold. Whatever is pre-ordained, is not erased by erasing. ||3||
The treasure of jewels is found in the ocean of the Guru's Teachings. The treasure of devotional worship is opened to me.
Focused on the Guru's Feet, faith wells up within me; chanting the Glorious Praises of the Lord, I hunger for more. ||4||
I am totally detached, continually, continuously meditating on the Lord; chanting the Glorious Praises of the Lord, I express my love for Him.
Time and time again, each and every moment and instant, I express it. I cannot find the Lord's limits; He is the farthest of the far. ||5||
The Shaastras, the Vedas and the Puraanas advise righteous actions, and the performance of the six religious rituals.
The hypocritical, self-willed manmukhs are ruined by doubt; in the waves of greed, their boat is heavily loaded, and it sinks. ||6||
So chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and through the Naam, find emancipation. The Simritees and Shaastras recommend the Naam.
Eradicating egotism, one becomes pure. The Gurmukh is inspired, and obtains the supreme status. ||7||
This world, with its colors and forms, is all Yours, O Lord; as You attach us, so do we do our deeds.
O Nanak, we are the instruments upon which He plays; as He wills, so is the path we take. ||8||2||5||
Bilaaval, Fourth Mehl:
The Gurmukh meditates on the Inaccessible, Unfathomable Lord. I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to the True Guru, the True Primal Being.
He has brought the Lord's Name to dwell upon my breath of life; meeting with the True Guru, I am absorbed into the Lord's Name. ||1||
The Name of the Lord is the only Support of His humble servants.
I shall live under the protection of the True Guru. By Guru's Grace, I shall attain the Court of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
This body is the field of karma; the Gurmukhs plow and work it, and harvest the essence.
The priceless jewel of the Naam becomes manifest, and it pours into their vessels of love. ||2||
Become the slave of the slave of the slave, of that humble being who has become the devotee of the Lord.
I dedicate my mind and intellect, and place them in offering before my Guru; by Guru's Grace, I speak the Unspoken. ||3||
The self-willed manmukhs are engrossed in attachment to Maya; their minds are thirsty, burning with desire.
Following the Guru's Teachings, I have obtained the Ambrosial Water of the Naam, and the fire has been put out. The Word of the Guru's Shabad has put it out. ||4||
This mind dances before the True Guru. The unstruck sound current of the Shabad resounds, vibrating the celestial melody.
