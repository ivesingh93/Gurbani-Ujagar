But he is foolish and greedy, and he never listens to what he is told. ||2||
Why bother to count one, two, three, four? The whole world is defrauded by the same enticements.
Hardly anyone loves the Lord's Name; how rare is that place which is in bloom. ||3||
The devotees look beautiful in the True Court; night and day, they are happy.
They are imbued with the Love of the Transcendent Lord; servant Nanak is a sacrifice to them. ||4||1||169||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl, Maajh:
The Destroyer of sorrow is Your Name, Lord; the Destroyer of sorrow is Your Name.
Twenty-four hours a day, dwell upon the wisdom of the Perfect True Guru. ||1||Pause||
That heart, in which the Supreme Lord God abides, is the most beautiful place.
The Messenger of Death does not even approach those who chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord with the tongue. ||1||
I have not understood the wisdom of serving Him, nor have I worshipped Him in meditation.
You are my Support, O Life of the World; O my Lord and Master, Inaccessible and Incomprehensible. ||2||
When the Lord of the Universe became merciful, sorrow and suffering departed.
The hot winds do not even touch those who are protected by the True Guru. ||3||
The Guru is the All-pervading Lord, the Guru is the Merciful Master; the Guru is the True Creator Lord.
When the Guru was totally satisfied, I obtained everything. Servant Nanak is forever a sacrifice to Him. ||4||2||170||
Gauree Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
The Lord, the Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam:
meditating on Him, all affairs are resolved. ||1||Pause||
Chanting the Name of the Lord of the Universe, one's mouth is sanctified.
One who recites to me the Praises of the Lord is my friend and brother. ||1||
All treasures, all rewards and all virtues are in the Lord of the Universe.
Why forget Him from your mind? Remembering Him in meditation, pain departs. ||2||
Grasping the hem of His robe, we live, and cross over the terrifying world-ocean.
Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, one is saved, and one's face becomes radiant in the Court of the Lord. ||3||
The Praise of the Sustainer of the Universe is the essence of life, and the wealth of His Saints.
Nanak is saved, chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord; in the True Court, he is cheered and applauded. ||4||3||171||
Gauree Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
Sing the Sweet Praises of the Lord, O my soul, sing the Sweet Praises of the Lord.
Attuned to the True One, even the homeless find a home. ||1||Pause||
All other tastes are bland and insipid; through them, the body and mind are rendered insipid as well.
Without the Transcendent Lord, what can anyone do? Cursed is his life, and cursed his reputation. ||1||
Grasping the hem of the robe of the Holy Saint, we cross over the world-ocean.
Worship and adore the Supreme Lord God, and all your family will be saved as well. ||2||
He is a companion, a relative, and a good friend of mine, who implants the Lord's Name within my heart.
He washes off all my demerits, and is so generous to me. ||3||
Wealth, treasures, and household are all just ruins; the Lord's Feet are the only treasure.
Nanak is a beggar standing at Your Door, God; he begs for Your charity. ||4||4||172||
