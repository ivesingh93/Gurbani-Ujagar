In the darkness, no one can sleep in peace.
The king and the pauper both weep and cry. ||1||
As long as the tongue does not chant the Lord's Name,
the person continues coming and going in reincarnation, crying out in pain. ||1||Pause||
It is like the shadow of a tree;
when the breath of life passes out of the mortal being, tell me, what becomes of his wealth? ||2||
It is like the music contained in the instrument;
how can anyone know the secret of the dead? ||3||
Like the swan on the lake, death hovers over the body.
Drink in the Lord's sweet elixir, Kabeer. ||4||8||
Gauree, Kabeer Jee:
The creation is born of the Light, and the Light is in the creation.
It bears two fruits: the false glass and the true pearl. ||1||
Where is that home, which is said to be free of fear?
There, fear is dispelled and one lives without fear. ||1||Pause||
On the banks of sacred rivers, the mind is not appeased.
People remain entangled in good and bad deeds. ||2||
Sin and virtue are both the same.
In the home of your own being, is the Philosopher's Stone; renounce your search for any other virtue. ||3||
Kabeer: O worthless mortal, do not lose the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Keep this mind of yours involved in this involvement. ||4||9||
Gauree, Kabeer Jee:
He claims to know the Lord, who is beyond measure and beyond thought;
by mere words, he plans to enter heaven. ||1||
I do not know where heaven is.
Everyone claims that he plans to go there. ||1||Pause||
By mere talk, the mind is not appeased.
The mind is only appeased, when egotism is conquered. ||2||
As long as the mind is filled with the desire for heaven,
he does not dwell at the Lord's Feet. ||3||
Says Kabeer, unto whom should I tell this?
The Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is heaven. ||4||10||
Gauree, Kabeer Jee:
We are born, and we grow, and having grown, we pass away.
Before our very eyes, this world is passing away. ||1||
How can you not dIE of shame, claiming, "This world is mine"?
At the very last moment, nothing is yours. ||1||Pause||
Trying various methods, you cherish your body,
but at the time of death, it is burned in the fire. ||2||
You apply sandalwood oil to your limbs,
but that body is burned with the firewood. ||3||
Says Kabeer, listen, O virtuous people:
your beauty shall vanish, as the whole world watches. ||4||11||
Gauree, Kabeer Jee:
Why do you cry and mourn, when another person dies?
Do so only if you yourself are to live. ||1||
I shall not dIE as the rest of the world dies,
for now I have met the life-giving Lord. ||1||Pause||
People anoint their bodies with fragrant oils,
and in that pleasure, they forget the supreme bliss. ||2||
There is one well, and five water-carriers.
Even though the rope is broken, the fools continue trying to draw water. ||3||
Says Kabeer, through contemplation, I have obtained this one understanding.
There is no well, and no water-carrier. ||4||12||
Gauree, Kabeer Jee:
The mobile and immobile creatures, insects and moths -
in numerous lifetimes, I have passed through those many forms. ||1||
I lived in many such homes, O Lord,
