Each and every moment, You cherish and nurture me; I am Your child, and I rely upon You alone. ||1||
I have only one tongue - which of Your Glorious Virtues can I describe?
Unlimited, infinite Lord and Master - no one knows Your limits. ||1||Pause||
You destroy millions of my sins, and teach me in so many ways.
I am so ignorant - I understand nothing at all. Please honor Your innate nature, and save me! ||2||
I seek Your Sanctuary - You are my only hope. You are my companion, and my best friend.
Save me, O Merciful Saviour Lord; Nanak is the slave of Your home. ||3||12||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
Worship, fasting, ceremonial marks on one's forehead, cleansing baths, generous donations to charities and self-mortification -
the Lord Master is not pleased with any of these rituals, no matter how sweetly one may speak. ||1||
Chanting the Name of God, the mind is soothed and pacified.
Everyone searches for Him in different ways, but the search is so difficult, and He cannot be found. ||1||Pause||
Chanting, deep meditation and penance, wandering over the face of the earth, the performance of austerities with the arms stretched up to the sky -
the Lord is not pleased by any of these means, though one may follow the path of Yogis and Jains. ||2||
The Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, and the Praises of the Lord are priceless; he alone obtains them, whom the Lord blesses with His Mercy.
Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, Nanak lives in the Love of God; his life-night passes in peace. ||3||13||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
Is there anyone who can release me from my bondage, unite me with God, recite the Name of the Lord, Har, Har,
and make this mind steady and stable, so that it no longer wanders around? ||1||
Do I have any such friend?
I would give him all my property, my soul and my heart; I would devote my consciousness to him. ||1||Pause||
Others' wealth, others' bodies, and the slander of others - do not attach your love to them.
Associate with the Saints, speak with the Saints, and keep your mind awake to the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises. ||2||
God is the treasure of virtue, kind and compassionate, the source of all comfort.
Nanak begs for the gift of Your Name; O Lord of the world, love him, like the mother loves her child. ||3||14||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
The Lord saves His Saints.
One who wishes misfortune upon the Lord's slaves, shall be destroyed by the Lord eventually. ||1||Pause||
He Himself is the help and support of His humble servants; He defeats the slanderers, and chases them away.
Wandering around aimlessly, they die out there; they never return to their homes again. ||1||
Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Destroyer of pain; he sings the Glorious Praises of the infinite Lord forever.
The faces of the slanderers are blackened in the courts of this world, and the world beyond. ||2||15||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
Now, I contemplate and meditate on the Lord, the Saviour Lord.
He purifies sinners in an instant, and cures all diseases. ||1||Pause||
Talking with the Holy Saints, my sexual desire, anger and greed have been eradicated.
Remembering, remembering the Perfect Lord in meditation, I have saved all my companions. ||1||
