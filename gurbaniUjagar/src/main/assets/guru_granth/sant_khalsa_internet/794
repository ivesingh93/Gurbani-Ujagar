Why are you asleep? Wake up, you ignorant fool!
You believe that your life in the world is true. ||1||Pause||
The One who gave you life shall also provide you with nourishment.
In each and every heart, He runs His shop.
Meditate on the Lord, and renounce your egotism and self-conceit.
Within your heart, contemplate the Naam, the Name of the Lord, sometime. ||2||
Your life has passed away, but you have not arranged your path.
Evening has set in, and soon there will be darkness on all sides.
Says Ravi Daas, O ignorant mad-man,
don't you realize, that this world is the house of death?! ||3||2||
Soohee:
You may have lofty mansions, halls and kitchens.
But you cannot stay in them, even for an instant, after death. ||1||
This body is like a house of straw.
When it is burnt, it mixes with dust. ||1||Pause||
Even relatives, family and friends,
begin to say, "Take his body out, immediately!"||2||
And the wife of his house, who was so attached to his body and heart,
runs away, crying out, "Ghost! Ghost!"||3||
Says Ravi Daas, the whole world has been plundered,
but I have escaped, chanting the Name of the One Lord. ||4||3||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Raag Soohee, The Word Of Shaykh Fareed Jee:
Burning and burning, writhing in pain, I wring my hands.
I have gone insane, seeking my Husband Lord.
O my Husband Lord, You are angry with me in Your Mind.
The fault is with me, and not with my Husband Lord. ||1||
O my Lord and Master, I do not know Your excellence and worth.
Having wasted my youth, now I come to regret and repent. ||1||Pause||
O black bird, what qualities have made you black?
I have been burnt by separation from my Beloved".
Without her Husband Lord, how can the soul-bride ever find peace?
When He becomes merciful, then God unites us with Himself. ||2||
The lonely soul-bride suffers in the pit of the world.
She has no companions, and no friends.
In His Mercy, God has united me with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
And when I look again, then I find God as my Helper. ||3||
The path upon which I must walk is very depressing.
It is sharper than a two-edged sword, and very narrow.
That is where my path lies.
O Shaykh Fareed, think of that path early on. ||4||1||
Soohee, Lalit:
You were not able to make yourself a raft when you should have.
When the ocean is churning and over-flowing, then it is very difficult to cross over it. ||1||
Do not touch the safflower with your hands; its color will fade away, my dear. ||1||Pause||
First, the bride herself is weak, and then, her Husband Lord's Order is hard to bear.
Milk does not return to the breast; it will not be collected again. ||2||
Says Fareed, O my companions, when our Husband Lord calls,
the soul departs, sad at heart, and this body returns to dust. ||3||2||
