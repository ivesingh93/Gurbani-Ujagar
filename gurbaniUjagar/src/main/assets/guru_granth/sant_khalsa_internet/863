His treasure is overflowing with the rubies of the Name.
He gives Support to all hearts. ||3||
The Name is the True Primal Being;
millions of sins are washed away in an instant, singing His Praises.
The Lord God is your best friend, your playmate from earliest childhood.
He is the Support of the breath of life; O Nanak, He is love, He is consciousness. ||4||1||3||
Gond, Fifth Mehl:
I trade in the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
The Naam is the Support of the mind.
My consciousness takes to the Shelter of the Naam.
Chanting the Naam, millions of sins are erased. ||1||
The Lord has blessed me with the wealth of the Naam, the Name of the One Lord.
The wish of my mind is to meditate on the Naam, in association with the Guru. ||1||Pause||
The Naam is the wealth of my soul.
Wherever I go, the Naam is with me.
The Naam is sweet to my mind.
In the water, on the land, and everywhere, I see the Naam. ||2||
Through the Naam, one's face becomes radiant in the Court of the Lord.
Through the Naam, all one's generations are saved.
Through the Naam, my affairs are resolved.
My mind is accustomed to the Naam. ||3||
Through the Naam, I have become fearless.
Through the Naam, my comings and goings have ceased.
The Perfect Guru has united me with the Lord, the treasure of virtue.
Says Nanak, I dwell in celestial peace. ||4||2||4||
Gond, Fifth Mehl:
He grants honor to the dishonored,
and gives gifts to all the hungry;
he protects those in the terrible womb.
So humbly bow forever to that Lord and Master. ||1||
Meditate on such a God in your mind.
He shall be your help and support everywhere, in good times and bad. ||1||Pause||
The beggar and the king are all the same to Him.
He sustains and fulfills both the ant and the elephant.
He does not consult or seek anyone's advice.
Whatever He does, He does Himself. ||2||
No one knows His limit.
He Himself is the Immaculate Lord.
He Himself is formed, and He Himself is formless.
In the heart, in each and every heart, He is the Support of all hearts. ||3||
Through the Love of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the devotees become His Beloveds.
Singing the Praises of the Creator, the Saints are forever in bliss.
Through the Love of the Naam, the Lord's humble servants remain satisfied.
Nanak falls at the feet of those humble servants of the Lord. ||4||3||5||
Gond, Fifth Mehl:
Associating with them, this mind becomes immaculate and pure.
Associating with them, one meditates in remembrance on the Lord, Har, Har.
Associating with them, all the sins are erased.
Associating with them, the heart is illumined. ||1||
Those Saints of the Lord are my friends.
It is their custom to sing only the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
By their mantra, the Lord, Har, Har, dwells in the mind.
By their teachings, doubt and fear are dispelled.
By their kirtan, they become immaculate and sublime.
The world longs for the dust of their feet. ||2||
Millions of sinners are saved by associating with them.
They have the Support of the Name of the One Formless Lord.
He knows the secrets of all beings;
He is the treasure of mercy, the divine immaculate Lord. ||3||
When the Supreme Lord God becomes merciful,
then one meets the Merciful Holy Guru.
