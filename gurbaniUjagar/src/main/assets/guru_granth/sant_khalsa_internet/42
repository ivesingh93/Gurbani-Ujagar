They keep death constantly before their eyes; they gather the Provisions of the Lord's Name, and receive honor.
The Gurmukhs are honored in the Court of the Lord. The Lord Himself takes them in His Loving Embrace. ||2||
For the Gurmukhs, the Way is obvious. At the Lord's Door, they face no obstructions.
They praise the Lord's Name, they keep the Naam in their minds, and they remain attached to the Love of the Naam.
The Unstruck Celestial Music vibrates for them at the Lord's Door, and they are honored at the True Door. ||3||
Those Gurmukhs who praise the Naam are applauded by everyone.
Grant me their company, God-I am a beggar; this is my prayer.
O Nanak, great is the good fortune of those Gurmukhs, who are filled with the Light of the Naam within. ||4||33||31||6||70||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl, First House:
Why are you so thrilled by the sight of your son and your beautifully decorated wife?
You enjoy tasty delicacies, you have lots of fun, and you indulge in endless pleasures.
You give all sorts of commands, and you act so superior.
The Creator does not come into the mind of the blind, idiotic, self-willed manmukh. ||1||
O my mind, the Lord is the Giver of peace.
By Guru's Grace, He is found. By His Mercy, He is obtained. ||1||Pause||
People are entangled in the enjoyment of fine clothes, but gold and silver are only dust.
They acquire beautiful horses and elephants, and ornate carriages of many kinds.
They think of nothing else, and they forget all their relatives.
They ignore their Creator; without the Name, they are impure. ||2||
Gathering the wealth of Maya, you earn an evil reputation.
Those whom you work to please shall pass away along with you.
The egotistical are engrossed in egotism, ensnared by the intellect of the mind.
One who is deceived by God Himself, has no position and no honor. ||3||
The True Guru, the Primal Being, has led me to meet the One, my only Friend.
The One is the Saving Grace of His humble servant. Why should the proud cry out in ego?
As the servant of the Lord wills, so does the Lord act. At the Lord's Door, none of his requests are denied.
Nanak is attuned to the Love of the Lord, whose Light pervades the entire Universe. ||4||1||71||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
With the mind caught up in playful pleasures, involved in all sorts of amusements and sights that stagger the eyes, people are led astray.
The emperors sitting on their thrones are consumed by anxiety. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, peace is found in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
If the Supreme Lord, the Architect of Destiny, writes such an order, then anguish and anxiety are erased. ||1||Pause||
There are so many places-I have wandered through them all.
The masters of wealth and the great land-lords have fallen, crying out, "This is mine! This is mine!" ||2||
They issue their commands fearlessly, and act in pride.
They subdue all under their command, but without the Name, they are reduced to dust. ||3||
Even those who are served by the 33 million angelic beings, at whose door the Siddhas and the Saadhus stand,
who live in wondrous affluence and rule over mountains, oceans and vast dominions-O Nanak, in the end, all this vanishes like a dream! ||4||2||72||
