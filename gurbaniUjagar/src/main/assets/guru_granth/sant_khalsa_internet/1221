Searching and searching, I have realized the essence of reality: devotional worship is the most sublime fulfillment.
Says Nanak, without the Name of the One Lord, all other ways are imperfect. ||2||62||85||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
The True Guru is the True Giver.
Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, all my pains are dispelled. I am a sacrifice to His Lotus Feet. ||1||Pause||
The Supreme Lord God is True, and True are the Holy Saints; the Name of the Lord is steady and stable.
So worship the Imperishable, Supreme Lord God with love, and sing His Glorious Praises. ||1||
The limits of the Inaccessible, Unfathomable Lord cannot be found; He is the Support of all hearts.
O Nanak, chant, "Waaho! Waaho!" to Him, who has no end or limitation. ||2||63||86||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
The Feet of the Guru abide within my mind.
My Lord and Master is permeating and pervading all places; He dwells nearby, close to all. ||1||Pause||
Breaking my bonds, I have lovingly tuned in to the Lord, and now the Saints are pleased with me.
This precious human life has been sanctified, and all my desires have been fulfilled. ||1||
O my God, whoever You bless with Your Mercy - he alone sings Your Glorious Praises.
Servant Nanak is a sacrifice to that person who sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe, twenty-four hours a day. ||2||64||87||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
A person is judged to be alive, only if he sees the Lord.
Please be merciful to me, O my Enticing Beloved Lord, and erase the record of my doubts. ||1||Pause||
By speaking and listening, tranquility and peace are not found at all. What can anyone learn without faith?
One who renounces God and longs for another - his face is blackened with filth. ||1||
One who is blessed with the wealth of our Lord and Master, the Embodiment of Peace, does not believe in any other religious doctrine.
O Nanak, one whose mind is fascinated and intoxicated with the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan - his tasks are perfectly accomplished. ||2||65||88||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Meditate in remembrance on the Naam, the Name of the One Lord.
In this way, the sins of your past mistakes shall be burnt off in an instant. It is like giving millions in charity, and bathing at sacred shrines of pilgrimage. ||1||Pause||
Entangled in other affairs, the mortal suffers uselessly in sorrow. Without the Lord, wisdom is useless.
The mortal is freed of the anguish of death and birth, meditating and vibrating on the Blissful Lord of the Universe. ||1||
I seek Your Sanctuary, O Perfect Lord, Ocean of Peace. Please be merciful, and bless me with this gift.
Meditating, meditating in remembrance on God, Nanak lives; his egotistical pride has been eradicated. ||2||66||89||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
He alone is a Dhoorat, who is attached to the Primal Lord God.
He alone is a Dhurandhar, and he alone is a Basundhar, who is absorbed in the sublime essence of Love of the One Lord. ||1||Pause||
One who practices deception and does not know where true profit lies is not a Dhoorat - he is a fool.
He abandons profitable enterprises and is involved in unprofitable ones. He does not meditate on the Beauteous Lord God. ||1||
He alone is clever and wise and a religious scholar, he alone is a brave warrior, and he alone is intelligent,
who chants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. O Nanak, he alone is approved. ||2||67||90||
