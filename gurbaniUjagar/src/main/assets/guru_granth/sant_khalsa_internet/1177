In this way, this mind is rejuvenated.
Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, day and night, egotism is removed and washed away from the Gurmukhs. ||1||Pause||
The True Guru speaks the Bani of the Word, and the Shabad, the Word of God.
This world blossoms forth in its greenery, through the love of the True Guru. ||2||
The mortal blossoms forth in flower and fruit, when the Lord Himself so wills.
He is attached to the Lord, the Primal Root of all, when he finds the True Guru. ||3||
The Lord Himself is the season of spring; the whole world is His Garden.
O Nanak, this most unique devotional worship comes only by perfect destiny. ||4||5||17||

I am a sacrifice to the Word of the Guru's Bani, O Siblings of Destiny. I am devoted and dedicated to the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
I praise my Guru forever, O Siblings of Destiny. I focus my consciousness on the Guru's Feet. ||1||
O my mind, focus your consciousness on the Lord's Name.
Your mind and body shall blossom forth in lush greenery, and you shall obtain the fruit of the Name of the One Lord. ||1||Pause||
Those who are protected by the Guru are saved, O Siblings of Destiny. They drink in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord's sublime essence.
The pain of egotism within is eradicated and banished, O Siblings of Destiny, and peace comes to dwell in their minds. ||2||
Those whom the Primal Lord Himself forgives, O Siblings of Destiny, are united with the Word of the Shabad.
The dust of their feet brings emancipation; in the company of Sadh Sangat, the True Congregation, we are united with the Lord. ||3||
He Himself does, and causes all to be done, O Siblings of Destiny; He makes everything blossom forth in green abundance.
O Nanak, peace fills their minds and bodies forever, O Siblings of Destiny; they are united with the Shabad. ||4||1||18||12||18||30||

One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Just as the light of the sun's rays spread out,
the Lord permeates each and every heart, through and through. ||1||
The One Lord is permeating and pervading all places.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, we merge with Him, O my mother. ||1||Pause||
The One Lord is deep within each and every heart.
Meeting with the Guru, the One Lord becomes manifest, radiating forth. ||2||
The One and Only Lord is present and prevailing everywhere.
The greedy, faithless cynic thinks that God is far away. ||3||
The One and Only Lord permeates and pervades the world.
O Nanak, whatever the One Lord does comes to pass. ||4||1||
Basant, Fourth Mehl:
Day and night, the two calls are sent out.
O mortal, meditate in remembrance on the Lord, who protects you forever, and saves you in the end. ||1||
Concentrate forever on the Lord, Har, Har, O my mind.
God the Destroyer of all depression and suffering is found, through the Guru's Teachings, singing the Glorious Praises of God. ||1||Pause||
The self-willed manmukhs dIE of their egotism, over and over again.
