Blessed is that place, and blessed is that house, in which the Saints dwell.
Fulfill this desire of servant Nanak, O Lord Master, that he may bow in reverence to Your devotees. ||2||9||40||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
He has saved me from the awful power of Maya, by attaching me to His feet.
He gave my mind the Mantra of the Naam, the Name of the One Lord, which shall never perish or leave me. ||1||
The Perfect True Guru has given this gift.
He has blessed me with the Kirtan of the Praises of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and I am emancipated. ||Pause||
My God has made me His own, and saved the honor of His devotee.
Nanak has grasped the feet of his God, and has found peace, day and night. ||2||10||41||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
Stealing the property of others, acting in greed, lying and slandering - in these ways, he passes his life.
He places his hopes in false mirages, believing them to be sweet; this is the support he installs in his mind. ||1||
The faithless cynic passes his life uselessly.
He is like the mouse, gnawing away at the pile of paper, making it useless to the poor wretch. ||Pause||
Have mercy on me, O Supreme Lord God, and release me from these bonds.
The blind are sinking, O Nanak; God saves them, uniting them with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||2||11||42||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
Remembering, remembering God, the Lord Master in meditation, my body, mind and heart are cooled and soothed.
The Supreme Lord God is my beauty, pleasure, peace, wealth, soul and social status. ||1||
My tongue is intoxicated with the Lord, the source of nectar.
I am in love, in love with the Lord's lotus feet, the treasure of riches. ||Pause||
I am His - He has saved me; this is God's perfect way.
The Giver of peace has blended Nanak with Himself; the Lord has preserved his honor. ||2||12||43||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
All demons and enemies are eradicated by You, Lord; Your glory is manifest and radiant.
Whoever harms Your devotees, You destroy in an instant. ||1||
I look to You continually, Lord.
O Lord, Destroyer of ego, please, be the helper and companion of Your slaves; take my hand, and save me, O my Friend! ||Pause||
My Lord and Master has heard my prayer, and given me His protection.
Nanak is in ecstasy, and his pains are gone; he meditates on the Lord, forever and ever. ||2||13||44||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
He has extended His power in all four directions, and placed His hand upon my head.
Gazing upon me with his Eye of Mercy, He has dispelled the pains of His slave. ||1||
The Guru, the Lord of the Universe, has saved the Lord's humble servant.
Hugging me close in His embrace, the merciful, forgiving Lord has erased all my sins. ||Pause||
Whatever I ask for from my Lord and Master, he gives that to me.
Whatever the Lord's slave Nanak utters with his mouth, proves to be true, here and hereafter. ||2||14||45||
