Says Nanak, those humble beings are exalted, who are pleasing to Your Mind, O my Lord and Master. ||16||1||8||
Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:
God is the almighty Giver of all peace and joy.
Be merciful to me, that I may meditate in remembrance on Your Name.
The Lord is the Great Giver; all beings and creatures are beggars; His humble servants yearn to beg from Him. ||1||
I beg for the dust of the feet of the humble, that I may be blessed with the supreme status,
and the filth of countless lifetimes may be erased.
The chronic diseases are cured by the medicine of the Lord's Name; I beg to be imbued with the Immaculate Lord. ||2||
With my ears, I listen to the Pure Praises of my Lord and Master.
With the Support of the One Lord, I have abandoned corruption, sexuality and desire.
I humbly bow and fall at the feet of Your slaves; I do not hesitate to do good deeds. ||3||
O Lord, with my tongue I sing Your Glorious Praises.
The sins which I have committed are erased.
Meditating, meditating in remembrance on my Lord and Master, my mind lives; I am rid of the five oppressive demons. ||4||
Meditating on Your lotus feet, I have come aboard Your boat.
Joining the Society of the Saints, I cross over the world-ocean.
My flower-offering and worship is to realize that the Lord is dwelling alike in all; I shall not be reincarnated naked again. ||5||
Please make me the slave of Your slaves, O Lord of the world.
You are the treasure of Grace, merciful to the meek.
Meet with your companion and helper, the Perfect Transcendent Lord God; you shall never be separated from Him again. ||6||
I dedicate my mind and body, and place them in offering before the Lord.
Asleep for countless lifetimes, I have awakened.
He, to whom I belong, is my cherisher and nurturer. I have killed and discarded my murderous self-conceit. ||7||
The Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, is pervading the water and the land.
The undeceivable Lord and Master is permeating each and every heart.
The Perfect Guru has demolished the wall of doubt, and now I see the One Lord pervading everywhere. ||8||
Wherever I look, there I see God, the ocean of peace.
The Lord's treasure is never exhausted; He is the storehouse of jewels.
He cannot be seized; He is inaccessible, and His limits cannot be found. He is realized when the Lord bestows His Grace. ||9||
My heart is cooled, and my mind and body are calmed and soothed.
The craving for birth and death is quenched.
Grasping hold of my hand, He has lifted me up and out; He has blessed me with His Ambrosial Glance of Grace. ||10||
The One and Only Lord is permeating and pervading everywhere.
There is none other than Him at all.
God permeates the beginning, the middle and the end; He has subdued my desires and doubts. ||11||
The Guru is the Transcendent Lord, the Guru is the Lord of the Universe.
The Guru is the Creator, the Guru is forever forgiving.
Meditating, chanting the Guru's Chant, I have obtained the fruits and rewards; in the Company of the Saints, I have been blessed with the lamp of spiritual wisdom. ||12||
Whatever I see, is my Lord and Master God.
Whatever I hear, is the Bani of God's Word.
Whatever I do, You make me do; You are the Sanctuary, the help and support of the Saints, Your children. ||13||
The beggar begs, and worships You in adoration.
You are the Purifier of the sinners, O Perfectly Holy Lord God.
Please bless me with this one gift, O treasure of all bliss and virtue; I do not ask for anything else. ||14||
