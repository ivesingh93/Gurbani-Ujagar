O my mind, remember the Dear Lord, and abandon the corruption of your mind.
Meditate on the Word of the Guru's Shabad; focus lovingly on the Truth. ||1||Pause||
One who forgets the Name in this world, shall not find any place of rest anywhere else.
He shall wander in all sorts of reincarnations, and rot away in manure. ||2||
By great good fortune, I have found the Guru, according to my pre-ordained destiny, O my mother.
Night and day, I practice true devotional worship; I am united with the True Lord. ||3||
He Himself fashioned the entire universe; He Himself bestows His Glance of Grace.
O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is glorious and great; as He pleases, He bestows His Blessings. ||4||2||
Maaroo, Third Mehl:
Please forgive my past mistakes, O my Dear Lord; now, please place me on the Path.
I remain attached to the Lord's Feet, and eradicate self-conceit from within. ||1||
O my mind, as Gurmukh, meditate on the Name of the Lord.
Remain attached forever to the Lord's Feet, single-mindedly, with love for the One Lord. ||1||Pause||
I have no social status or honor; I have no place or home.
Pierced through by the Word of the Shabad, my doubts have been cut away. The Guru has inspired me to understand the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||
This mind wanders around, driven by greed, totally attached to greed.
He is engrossed in false pursuits; he shall endure beatings in the City of Death. ||3||
O Nanak, God Himself is all-in-all. There is no other at all.
He bestows the treasure of devotional worship, and the Gurmukhs abide in peace. ||4||3||
Maaroo, Third Mehl:
Seek and find those who are imbued with Truth; they are so rare in this world.
Meeting with them, one's face becomes radiant and bright, chanting the Name of the Lord. ||1||
O Baba, contemplate and cherish the True Lord and Master within your heart.
Seek out and see, and ask your True Guru, and obtain the true commodity. ||1||Pause||
All serve the One True Lord; through pre-ordained destiny, they meet Him.
The Gurmukhs merge with Him, and will not be separated from Him again; they attain the True Lord. ||2||
Some do not appreciate the value of devotional worship; the self-willed manmukhs are deluded by doubt.
They are filled with self-conceit; they cannot accomplish anything. ||3||
Stand and offer your prayer, to the One who cannot be moved by force.
O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides within the mind of the Gurmukh; hearing his prayer, the Lord applauds him. ||4||4||
Maaroo, Third Mehl:
He transforms the burning desert into a cool oasis; he transmutes rusted iron into gold.
So praise the True Lord; there is none other as great as He is. ||1||
O my mind, night and day, meditate on the Lord's Name.
Contemplate the Word of the Guru's Teachings, and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, night and day. ||1||Pause||
As Gurmukh, one comes to know the One Lord, when the True Guru instructs him.
Praise the True Guru, who imparts this understanding. ||2||
Those who forsake the True Guru, and attach themselves to duality - what will they do when they go to the world hereafter?
Bound and gagged in the City of Death, they will be beaten. They will be punished severely. ||3||
