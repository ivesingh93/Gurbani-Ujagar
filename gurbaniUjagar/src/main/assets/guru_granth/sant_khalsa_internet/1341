The Word of the Guru's Shabad has come to dwell within my heart. ||3||
The Guru is All-powerful and Merciful forever.
Chanting and meditating on the Lord, Nanak is exalted and enraptured. ||4||11||
Prabhaatee, Fifth Mehl:
Chanting Guru, Guru, I have found eternal peace.
God, Merciful to the meek, has become kind and compassionate; He has inspired me to chant His Name. ||1||Pause||
Joining the Society of the Saints, I am illumined and enlightened.
Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, my hopes have been fulfilled. ||1||
I am blessed with total salvation, and my mind is filled with peace.
I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord; O Nanak, the Guru has been gracious to me. ||2||12||
Prabhaatee, Fifth Mehl, Second House, Bibhaas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
There is no other place of rest,
none at all, without the Lord's Name.
There is total success and salvation,
and all affairs are perfectly resolved. ||1||
Constantly chant the Name of the Lord.
Sexuality, anger and egotism are wiped away; let yourself fall in love with the One Lord. ||1||Pause||
Attached to the Naam, the Name of the Lord, pain runs away. In His Sanctuary, He cherishes and sustains us.
Whoever has such pre-ordained destiny meets with the True Guru; the Messenger of Death cannot grab him. ||2||
Night and day, meditate on the Lord, Har, Har; abandon the doubts of your mind.
One who has perfect karma joins the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and meets the Lord. ||3||
The sins of countless lifetimes are erased, and one is protected by the Lord Himself.
He is our Mother, Father, Friend and Sibling; O servant Nanak, meditate on the Lord, Har, Har. ||4||1||13||
Prabhaatee, Fifth Mehl, Bibhaas, Partaal:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Chant the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam.
Conflict, suffering, greed and emotional attachment shall be dispelled, and the fever of egotism shall be relieved. ||1||Pause||
Renounce your selfishness, and grasp the feet of the Saints; your mind shall be sanctified, and your sins shall be taken away. ||1||
Nanak, the child, does not know anything at all. O God, please protect me; You are my Mother and Father. ||2||1||14||
Prabhaatee, Fifth Mehl:
I have taken the Shelter and Support of the Lord's Lotus Feet.
You are Lofty and Exalted, Grand and Infinite, O my Lord and Master; You alone are above all. ||1||Pause||
He is the Support of the breath of life, the Destroyer of pain, the Giver of discriminating understanding. ||1||
So bow down in respect to the Savior Lord; worship and adore the One God.
Bathing in the dust of the feet of the Saints, Nanak is blessed with countless comforts. ||2||2||15||
