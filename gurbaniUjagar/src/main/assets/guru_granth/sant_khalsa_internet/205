The Unseen Lord is deep within the self; He cannot be seen; the curtain of egotism intervenes.
In emotional attachment to Maya, all the world is asleep. Tell me, how can this doubt be dispelled? ||1||
The one lives together with the other in the same house, but they do not talk to one another, O Siblings of Destiny.
Without the one substance, the five are miserable; that substance is in the unapproachable place. ||2||
And the one whose home it is, has locked it up, and given the key to the Guru.
You may make all sorts of efforts, but it cannot be obtained, without the Sanctuary of the True Guru. ||3||
Those whose bonds have been broken by the True Guru, enshrine love for the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
The self-elect, the self-realized beings, meet together and sing the joyous songs of the Lord. Nanak, there is no difference between them, O Siblings of Destiny. ||4||
This is how my Sovereign Lord King, the Lord of the Universe, is met;
celestial bliss is attained in an instant, and doubt is dispelled. Meeting Him, my light merges in the Light. ||1||Second. Pause||1||122||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
I am intimate with Him;
granting His Grace, my Kind Beloved has told me of the True Guru. ||1||Pause||
Wherever I look, there You are; I am totally convinced of this.
Unto whom should I pray? The Lord Himself hears all. ||1||
My anxiety is over. The Guru has cut away my bonds, and I have found eternal peace.
Whatever shall be, shall be in the end; so where can pain and pleasure be seen? ||2||
The continents and the solar systems rest in the support of the One Lord. The Guru has removed the veil of illusion, and shown this to me.
The nine treasures of the wealth of the Name of the Lord are in that one place. Where else should we go? ||3||
The same gold is fashioned into various articles; just so, the Lord has made the many patterns of the creation.
Says Nanak, the Guru has dispelled my doubt; in this way, my essence merges into God's essence. ||4||2||123||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
This life is diminishing, day and night.
Meeting with the Guru, your affairs shall be resolved. ||1||Pause||
Listen, my friends, I beg of you: now is the time to serve the Saints!
In this world, earn the profit of the Lord's Name, and hereafter, you shall dwell in peace. ||1||
This world is engrossed in corruption and cynicism. Only those who know God are saved.
Those who are awakened by the Lord to drink in this sublime essence, come to know the Unspoken Speech of the Lord. ||2||
Purchase only that for which you have come into the world, and through the Guru, the Lord shall dwell within your mind.
Within the home of your own inner being, you shall obtain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence with intuitive ease. You shall not be consigned again to the wheel of reincarnation. ||3||
O Inner-knower, Searcher of hearts, Primal Being, Architect of Destiny: please fulfill this yearning of my mind.
Nanak, Your slave, begs for this happiness: let me be the dust of the feet of the Saints. ||4||3||124||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Save me, O My Father God.
I am worthless and without virtue; all virtues are Yours. ||1||Pause||
The five vicious thieves are assaulting my poor being; save me, O Savior Lord!
They are tormenting and torturing me. I have come, seeking Your Sanctuary. ||1||
