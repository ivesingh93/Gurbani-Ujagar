Overcoming my egotism and quieting the desires within my mind, I have come to realize the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||4||
God automatically does the work of those who love the Name of the Lord.
By Guru's Grace, he ever dwells in their minds, and He resolves all their affairs.
Whoever challenges them is destroyed; they have the Lord God as their Savior. ||5||
Without serving the True Guru, no one finds the Lord; the self-willed manmukhs die crying out in pain.
They come and go, and find no place of rest; in pain and suffering, they perish.
But one who becomes Gurmukh drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar, and is easily absorbed in the True Name. ||6||
Without serving the True Guru, one cannot escape reincarnation, even by performing numerous rituals.
Those who read the Vedas, and argue and debate without the Lord, lose their honor.
True is the True Guru, and True is the Word of His Bani; in the Guru's Sanctuary, one is saved. ||7||
Those whose minds are filled with the Lord are judged as true in the Court of the Lord; they are hailed as true in the True Court.
Their praises echo throughout the ages, and no one can erase them.
Nanak is forever a sacrifice to those who enshrine the Lord within their hearts. ||8||1||
Sorat'h, Third Mehl, Du-Tukas:
He Himself forgives the worthless, O Siblings of Destiny; He commits them to the service of the True Guru.
Service to the True Guru is sublime, O Siblings of Destiny; through it, one's consciousness is attached to the Lord's Name. ||1||
The Dear Lord forgives, and unites with Himself.
I am a sinner, totally without virtue, O Siblings of Destiny; the Perfect True Guru has blended me. ||Pause||
So many, so many sinners have been forgiven, O beloved one, by contemplating the True Word of the Shabad.
They got on board the boat of the True Guru, who carried them across the terrifying world-ocean, O Siblings of Destiny. ||2||
I have been transformed from rusty iron into gold, O Siblings of Destiny, united in Union with the Guru, the Philosopher's Stone.
Eliminating my self-conceit, the Name has come to dwell within my mind, O Siblings of Destiny; my light has merged in the Light. ||3||
I am a sacrifice, I am a sacrifice, O Siblings of Destiny, I am forever a sacrifice to my True Guru.
He has given me the treasure of the Naam; O Siblings of Destiny, through the Guru's Teachings, I am absorbed in celestial bliss. ||4||
Without the Guru, celestial peace is not produced, O Siblings of Destiny; go and ask the spiritual teachers about this.
Serve the True Guru forever, O Siblings of Destiny, and eradicate self-conceit from within. ||5||
Under Guru's Instruction, the Fear of God is produced, O Siblings of Destiny; true and excellent are the deeds done in the Fear of God.
Then, one is blessed with the treasure of the Lord's Love, O Siblings of Destiny, and the Support of the True Name. ||6||
I fall at the feet of those who serve their True Guru, O Siblings of Destiny.
I have fulfilled my life, O Siblings of Destiny, and my family has been saved as well. ||7||
The True Word of the Guru's Bani, and the True Word of the Shabad, O Siblings of Destiny, are obtained only by Guru's Grace.
O Nanak, with the Name of the Lord abiding in one's mind, no obstacles stand in one's way, O Siblings of Destiny. ||8||2||
