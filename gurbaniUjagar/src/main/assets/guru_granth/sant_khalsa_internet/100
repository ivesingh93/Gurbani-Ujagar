I applied the dust of the feet of the Saints to my face.
My evil-mindedness disappeared, along with my misfortune and false-mindedness.
I sit in the true home of my self; I sing His Glorious Praises. O Nanak, my falsehood has vanished! ||4||11||18||
Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
I shall never forget You-You are such a Great Giver!
Please grant Your Grace, and imbue me with the love of devotional worship.
If it pleases You, let me meditate on You day and night; please, grant me this gift! ||1||
Into this blind clay, You have infused awareness.
Everything, everywhere which You have given is good.
Bliss, joyful celebrations, wondrous plays and entertainment-whatever pleases You, comes to pass. ||2||
Everything we receive is a gift from Him -
the thirty-six delicious foods to eat,
cozy beds, cooling breezes, peaceful joy and the experience of pleasure. ||3||
Give me that state of mind, by which I may not forget You.
Give me that understanding, by which I may meditate on You.
I sing Your Glorious Praises with each and every breath. Nanak takes the Support of the Guru's Feet. ||4||12||19||
Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
To praise You is to follow Your Command and Your Will.
That which pleases You is spiritual wisdom and meditation.
That which pleases God is chanting and meditation; to be in harmony with His Will is perfect spiritual wisdom. ||1||
He alone sings Your Ambrosial Naam,
who is pleasing to Your Mind, O my Lord and Master.
You belong to the Saints, and the Saints belong to You. The minds of the Saints are attuned to You, O my Lord and Master. ||2||
You cherish and nurture the Saints.
The Saints play with You, O Sustainer of the World.
Your Saints are very dear to You. You are the breath of life of the Saints. ||3||
My mind is a sacrifice to those Saints who know You,
and are pleasing to Your Mind.
In their company I have found a lasting peace. Nanak is satisfied and fulfilled with the Sublime Essence of the Lord. ||4||13||20||
Maajh, Fifth Mehl
: You are the Ocean of Water, and I am Your fish.
Your Name is the drop of water, and I am a thirsty rain-bird.
You are my hope, and You are my thirst. My mind is absorbed in You. ||1||
Just as the baby is satisfied by drinking milk,
and the poor person is pleased by seeing wealth,
and the thirsty person is refreshed by drinking cool water, so is this mind drenched with delight in the Lord. ||2||
Just as the darkness is lit up by the lamp,
and the hopes of the wife are fulfilled by thinking about her husband,
and people are filled with bliss upon meeting their beloved, so is my mind imbued with the Lord's Love. ||3||
The Saints have set me upon the Lord's Path.
By the Grace of the Holy Saint, I have been attuned to the Lord.
The Lord is mine, and I am the slave of the Lord. O Nanak, the Guru has blessed me with the True Word of the Shabad. ||4||14||21||
Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
The Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, is eternally pure.
The Lord is the Giver of Peace and the Dispeller of sorrow.
I have seen and tasted all other flavors, but to my mind, the Subtle Essence of the Lord is the sweetest of all. ||1||
