The worship of the Lord is unique - it is known only by reflecting upon the Guru.
O Nanak, one whose mind is filled with the Naam, through the Lord's Fear and devotion, is embellished with the Naam. ||9||14||36||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
He wanders around, engrossed in other pleasures, but without the Naam, he suffers in pain.
He does not meet the True Guru, the Primal Being, who imparts true understanding. ||1||
O my insane mind, drink in the sublime essence of the Lord, and savor its taste.
Attached to other pleasures, you wander around, and your life wastes away uselessly. ||1||Pause||
In this age, the Gurmukhs are pure; they remain absorbed in the love of the True Name.
Without the destiny of good karma, nothing can be obtained; what can we say or do? ||2||
He understands his own self, and dies in the Word of the Shabad; he banishes corruption from his mind.
He hurries to the Guru's Sanctuary, and is forgiven by the Forgiving Lord. ||3||
Without the Name, peace is not obtained, and pain does not depart from within.
This world is engrossed in attachment to Maya; it has gone astray in duality and doubt. ||4||
The forsaken soul-brides do not know the value of their Husband Lord; how can they decorate themselves?
Night and day, they continually burn, and they do not enjoy the Bed of their Husband Lord. ||5||
The happy soul-brides obtain the Mansion of His Presence, eradicating their self-conceit from within.
They decorate themselves with the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and their Husband Lord unites them with Himself. ||6||
He has forgotten death, in the darkness of attachment to Maya.
The self-willed manmukhs dIE again and again, and are reborn; they dIE again, and are miserable at the Gate of Death. ||7||
They alone are united, whom the Lord unites with Himself; they contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
O Nanak, they are absorbed in the Naam; their faces are radiant, in that True Court. ||8||22||15||37||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Ashtapadees, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
When the five virtues were reconciled, and the five passions were estranged,
I enshrined the five within myself, and cast out the other five. ||1||
In this way, the village of my body became inhabited, O my Siblings of Destiny.
Vice departed, and the Guru's spiritual wisdom was implanted within me. ||1||Pause||
The fence of true Dharmic religion has been built around it.
The spiritual wisdom and reflective meditation of the Guru has become its strong gate. ||2||
So plant the seed of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, O friends, O Siblings of Destiny.
Deal only in the constant service of the Guru. ||3||
With intuitive peace and happiness, all the shops are filled.
The Banker and the dealers dwell in the same place. ||4||
There is no tax on non-believers, nor any fines or taxes at death.
The True Guru has set the Seal of the Primal Lord upon these goods. ||5||
So load the merchandise of the Naam, and set sail with your cargo.
Earn your profit, as Gurmukh, and you shall return to your own home. ||6||
The True Guru is the Banker, and His Sikhs are the traders.
Their merchandise is the Naam, and meditation on the True Lord is their account. ||7||
One who serves the True Guru dwells in this house.
O Nanak, the Divine City is eternal. ||8||1||
