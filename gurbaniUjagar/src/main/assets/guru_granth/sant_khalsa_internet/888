but your mind wanders in the ten directions.
You apply a ceremonial tilak mark to its forehead, and fall at its feet.
You try to appease the people, and act blindly. ||2||
You perform the six religious rituals, and sit wearing your loin-cloth.
In the homes of the wealthy, you read the prayer book.
You chant on your mala, and beg for money.
No one has ever been saved in this way, friend. ||3||
He alone is a Pandit, who lives the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Maya, of the three qualities, leaves him.
The four Vedas are completely contained within the Lord's Name.
Nanak seeks His Sanctuary. ||4||6||17||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
Millions of troubles do not come near him;
the many manifestations of Maya are his hand-maidens;
countless sins are his water-carriers;
he is blessed with the Grace of the Creator Lord. ||1||
One who has the Lord God as his help and support -
all his efforts are fulfilled. ||1||Pause||
He is protected by the Creator Lord; what harm can anyone do to him?
Even an ant can conquer the whole world.
His glory is endless; how can I describe it?
I am a sacrifice, a devoted sacrifice, to His feet. ||2||
He alone performs worship, austerities and meditation;
he alone is a giver to various charities;
he alone is approved in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga,
whom the Lord Master blesses with honor. ||3||
Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I am enlightened.
I have found celestial peace, and my hopes are fulfilled.
The Perfect True Guru has blessed me with faith.
Nanak is the slave of His slaves. ||4||7||18||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
Don't blame others, O people;
as you plant, so shall you harvest.
By your actions, you have bound yourself.
You come and go, entangled in Maya. ||1||
Such is the understanding of the Saintly people.
You shall be enlightened, through the Word of the Perfect Guru. ||1||Pause||
Body, wealth, spouse and ostentatious displays are false.
Horses and elephants will pass away.
Power, pleasures and beauty are all false.
Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, everything is reduced to dust. ||2||
The egotistical people are deluded by useless doubt.
Of all this expanse, nothing shall go along with you.
Through pleasure and pain, the body is growing old.
Doing these things, the faithless cynics are passing their lives. ||3||
The Name of the Lord is Ambrosial Nectar in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga.
This treasure is obtained from the Holy.
O Nanak, whoever pleases the Guru,
the Lord of the Universe, beholds the Lord in each and every heart. ||4||8||19||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
The Panch Shabad, the five primal sounds, echo the perfect sound current of the Naad.
The wondrous, amazing unstruck melody vibrates.
The Saintly people play there with the Lord.
They remain totally detached, absorbed in the Supreme Lord God. ||1||
It is the realm of celestial peace and bliss.
The Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, sits and sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. There is no disease or sorrow there, no birth or death. ||1||Pause||
There, they meditate only on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
How rare are those who find this place of rest.
The love of God is their food, and the Kirtan of the Lord's Praise is their support.
