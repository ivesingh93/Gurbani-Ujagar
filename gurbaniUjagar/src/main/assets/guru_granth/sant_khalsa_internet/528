I have burnt in the fire the clever devices and praises of the world.
Some speak good of me, and some speak ill of me, but I have surrendered my body to You. ||1||
Whoever comes to Your Sanctuary, O God, Lord and Master, You save by Your Merciful Grace.
Servant Nanak has entered Your Sanctuary, Dear Lord; O Lord, please, protect his honor! ||2||4||
Dayv-Gandhaaree:
I am a sacrifice to one who sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
I live by continuously beholding the Blessed Vision of the Holy Guru's Darshan; within His Mind is the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
You are pure and immaculate, O God, Almighty Lord and Master; how can I, the impure one, meet You?
I have one thing in my mind, and another thing on my lips; I am such a poor, unfortunate liar! ||1||
I appear to chant the Lord's Name, but within my heart, I am the most wicked of the wicked.
As it pleases You, save me, O Lord and Master; servant Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary. ||2||5||
Dayv-Gandhaaree:
Without the Name of the Lord, the beautiful are just like the noseless ones.
Like the son, born into the house of a prostitute, his name is cursed. ||1||Pause||
Those who do not have the Name of their Lord and Master within their hearts, are the most wretched, deformed lepers.
Like the person who has no Guru, they may know many things, but they are cursed in the Court of the Lord. ||1||
Those, unto whom my Lord Master becomes Merciful, long for the feet of the Holy.
O Nanak, the sinners become pure, joining the Company of the Holy; following the Guru, the True Guru, they are emancipated. ||2||6|| Chhakaa 1||
Dayv-Gandhaaree, Fifth Mehl, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O mother, I focus my consciousness on the Guru's feet.
As God shows His Mercy, the lotus of my heart blossoms, and forever and ever, I meditate on the Lord. ||1||Pause||
The One Lord is within, and the One Lord is outside; the One Lord is contained in all.
Within the heart, beyond the heart, and in all places, God, the Perfect One, is seen to be permeating. ||1||
So many of Your servants and silent sages sing Your Praises, but no one has found Your limits.
O Giver of peace, Destroyer of pain, Lord and Master - servant Nanak is forever a sacrifice to You. ||2||1||
Dayv-Gandhaaree:
O mother, whatever is to be, shall be.
God pervades His pervading creation; one gains, while another loses. ||1||Pause||
Sometimes he blossoms in bliss, while at other times, he suffers in mourning. Sometimes he laughs, and sometimes he weeps.
Sometimes he is filled with the filth of ego, while at other times, he washes it off in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||1||
No one can erase the actions of God; I cannot see any other like Him.
Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to the Guru; by His Grace, I sleep in peace. ||2||2||
