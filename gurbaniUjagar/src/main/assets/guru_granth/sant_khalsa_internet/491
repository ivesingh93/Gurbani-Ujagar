This deed was done by the Creator Lord; one's light merges into the Light. ||4||3||5||
Goojaree, Third Mehl:
Everyone chants the Lord's Name, Raam, Raam; but by such chanting, the Lord is not obtained.
By Guru's Grace, the Lord comes to dwell in the mind, and then, the fruits are obtained. ||1||
One who enshrines love for God within his mind,
never forgets the Lord; he continually chants the Lord's Name, Har, Har, in his conscious mind. ||1||Pause||
Those whose hearts are filled with hypocrisy, who are called saints only for their outward show -
their desires are never satisfied, and they depart grieving in the end. ||2||
Although one may bathe at many places of pilgrimage, still, his ego never departs.
That man, whose sense of duality does not depart - the Righteous Judge of Dharma shall punish him. ||3||
That humble being, unto whom God showers His Mercy, obtains Him; how few are the Gurmukhs who understand Him.
O Nanak, if one conquers his ego within, then he comes to meet the Lord. ||4||4||6||
Goojaree, Third Mehl:
That humble being who eliminates his ego is at peace; he is blessed with an ever-stable intellect.
That humble being is immaculately pure, who, as Gurmukh, understands the Lord, and focuses his consciousness on the Lord's Feet. ||1||
O my unconscious mind, remain conscious of the Lord, and you shall obtain the fruits of your desires.
By Guru's Grace, you shall obtain the sublime elixir of the Lord; by continually drinking it in, you shall have eternal peace. ||1||Pause||
When one meets the True Guru, he becomes the philosopher's stone, with the ability to transform others, inspiring them to worship the Lord.
One who worships the Lord in adoration, obtains his rewards; instructing others, he reveals the Truth. ||2||
Without becoming the philosopher's stone, he does not inspire others to worship the Lord; without instructing his own mind, how can he instruct others?
The ignorant, blind man calls himself the guru, but to whom can he show the way? ||3||
O Nanak, without His Mercy, nothing can be obtained. One upon whom He casts His Glance of Grace, obtains Him.
By Guru's Grace, God bestows greatness, and projects the Word of His Shabad. ||4||5||7||
Goojaree, Third Mehl, Panch-Padas:
Wisdom is not produced in Benares, nor is wisdom lost in Benares.
Meeting the True Guru, wisdom is produced, and then, one obtains this understanding. ||1||
Listen to the sermon of the Lord, O mind, and enshrine the Shabad of His Word within your mind.
If your intellect remains stable and steady, then doubt shall depart from within you. ||1||Pause||
Enshrine the Lord's lotus feet within your heart, and your sins shall be erased.
If your soul overcomes the five elements, then you shall come to have a home at the true place of pilgrimage. ||2||
This mind of the self-centered manmukh is so stupid; it does not obtain any understanding at all.
It does not understand the Name of the Lord; it departs repenting in the end. ||3||
In this mind are found Benares, all sacred shrines of pilgrimage and the Shaastras; the True Guru has explained this.
The sixty-eight places of pilgrimage remain with one, whose heart is filled with the Lord. ||4||
O Nanak, upon meeting the True Guru, the Order of the Lord's Will is understood, and the One Lord comes to dwell in the mind.
Those who are pleasing to You, O True Lord, are true. They remain absorbed in You. ||5||6||8||
