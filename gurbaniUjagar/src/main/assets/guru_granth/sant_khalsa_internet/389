Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
You are my waves, and I am Your fish.
You are my Lord and Master; I wait at Your Door. ||1||
You are my Creator, and I am Your servant.
I have taken to Your Sanctuary, O God, most profound and excellent. ||1||Pause||
You are my life, You are my Support.
Beholding You, my heart-lotus blossoms forth. ||2||
You are my salvation and honor; You make me acceptable.
You are All-powerful, You are my strength. ||3||
Night and day, I chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the treasure of excellence.
This is Nanak's prayer to God. ||4||23||74||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The mourner practices falsehood;
he laughs with glee, while mourning for others. ||1||
Someone has died, while there is singing in someone else's house.
One mourns and bewails, while another laughs with glee. ||1||Pause||
From childhood to old age,
the mortal does not attain his goals, and he comes to regret in the end. ||2||
The world is under the influence of the three qualities.
The mortal is reincarnated, again and again, into heaven and hell. ||3||
Says Nanak, one who is attached to the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
becomes acceptable, and his life becomes fruitful. ||4||24||75||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
She remains asleep, and does not know the news of God.
The day dawns, and then, she regrets. ||1||
Loving the Beloved, the mind is filled with celestial bliss.
You yearn to meet with God, so why do you delay? ||1||Pause||
He came and poured His Ambrosial Nectar into your hands,
but it slipped through your fingers, and fell onto the ground. ||2||
You are burdened with desire, emotional attachment and egotism;
it is not the fault of God the Creator. ||3||
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the darkness of doubt is dispelled.
O Nanak, the Creator Lord blends us with Himself. ||4||25||76||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
I long for the Lotus Feet of my Beloved Lord.
The wretched Messenger of Death has run away from me. ||1||
You enter into my mind, by Your Kind Mercy.
Meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, all diseases are destroyed. ||1||Pause||
Death gives so much pain to others,
but it cannot even come near Your slave. ||2||
My mind thirsts for Your Vision;
in peaceful ease and bliss, I dwell in detachment. ||3||
Hear this prayer of Nanak:
please, infuse Your Name into his heart. ||4||26||77||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
My mind is satisfied, and my entanglements have been dissolved.
God has become merciful to me. ||1||
By the Grace of the Saints, everything has turned out well.
His House is overflowing with all things; I have met Him, the Fearless Master. ||1||Pause||
By the Kind Mercy of the Holy Saints, the Naam has been implanted within me.
The most dreadful desires have been eliminated. ||2||
My Master has given me a gift;
the fire has been extinguished, and my mind is now at peace. ||3||
My search has ended, and my mind is absorbed in celestial bliss.
