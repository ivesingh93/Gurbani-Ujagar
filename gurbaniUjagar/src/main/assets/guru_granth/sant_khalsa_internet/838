Be Merciful, and attach me to the hem of Your robe.
Nanak meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||
O Merciful Master of the meek, You are my Lord and Master, O Merciful Master of the meek.
I yearn for the dust of the feet of the Saints. ||1||Pause||
The world is a pit of poison,
filled with the utter darkness of ignorance and emotional attachment.
Please take my hand, and save me, Dear God.
Please bless me with Your Name, Lord.
Without You, God, I have no place at all.
Nanak is a sacrifice, a sacrifice to You. ||2||
The human body is in the grip of greed and attachment.
Without meditating and vibrating upon the Lord, it is reduced to ashes.
The Messenger of Death is dreadful and horrible.
The recording scribes of the conscious and the unconscious, Chitr and Gupt, know all actions and karma.
Day and night, they bear witness.
Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord. ||3||
O Lord, Destroyer of fear and egotism,
be merciful, and save the sinners.
My sins cannot even be counted.
Without the Lord, who can hide them?
I thought of Your Support, and seized it, O my Lord and Master.
Please, give Nanak Your hand and save him, Lord! ||4||
The Lord, the treasure of virtue, the Lord of the world,
cherishes and sustains every heart.
My mind is thirsty for Your Love, and the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.
O Lord of the Universe, please fulfill my hopes.
I cannot survive, even for an instant.
By great good fortune, Nanak has found the Lord. ||5||
Without You, God, there is no other at all.
My mind loves You, as the partridge loves the moon,
as the fish loves the water,
as the bee and the lotus cannot be separated.
As the chakvi bird longs for the sun,
so does Nanak thirst for the Lord's feet. ||6||
As the young bride places the hopes of her life in her husband,
as the greedy person looks upon the gift of wealth,
as milk is joined to water,
as food is to the very hungry man,
and as the mother loves her son,
so does Nanak constantly remember the Lord in meditation. ||7||
As the moth falls into the lamp,
as the thief steals without hesitation,
as the elephant is trapped by its sexual urges,
as the sinner is caught in his sins,
as the gambler's addiction does not leave him,
so is this mind of Nanak's attached to the Lord. ||8||
As the deer loves the sound of the bell,
and as the song-bird longs for the rain,
the Lord's humble servant lives in the Society of the Saints,
lovingly meditating and vibrating upon the Lord of the Universe.
My tongue chants the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Please bless Nanak with the gift of the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. ||9||
One who sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and hears them, and writes them,
receives all fruits and rewards from the Lord.
He saves all his ancestors and generations,
and crosses over the world-ocean.
The Lord's Feet are the boat to carry him across.
Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, he sings the Praises of the Lord.
The Lord protects his honor.
Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord's door. ||10||2||
