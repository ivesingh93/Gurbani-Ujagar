Soohee, First Mehl:
That vessel alone is pure, which is pleasing to Him.
The filthiest vessel does not become pure, simply by being washed.
Through the Gurdwara, the Guru's Gate, one obtains understanding.
By being washed through this Gate, it becomes pure.
The Lord Himself sets the standards to differentiate between the dirty and the pure.
Do not think that you will automatically find a place of rest hereafter.
According to the actions one has committed, so does the mortal become.
He Himself bestows the Ambrosial Name of the Lord.
Such a mortal departs with honor and renown; his life is embellished and redeemed, and the trumpets resound with his glory.
Why speak of poor mortals? His glory shall echo throughout the three worlds.
O Nanak, he himself shall be enraptured, and he shall save his entire ancestry. ||1||4||6||
Soohee, First Mehl:
The Yogi practices yoga, and the pleasure-seeker practices eating.
The austere practice austerities, bathing and rubbing themselves at sacred shrines of pilgrimage. ||1||
Let me hear some news of You, O Beloved; if only someone would come and sit with me, and tell me. ||1||Pause||
As one plants, so does he harvest; whatever he earns, he eats.
In the world hereafter, his account is not called for, if he goes with the insignia of the Lord. ||2||
According to the actions the mortal commits, so is he proclaimed.
And that breath which is drawn without thinking of the Lord, that breath goes in vain. ||3||
I would sell this body, if someone would only purchase it.
O Nanak, that body is of no use at all, if it does not enshrine the Name of the True Lord. ||4||5||7||
Soohee, First Mehl, Seventh House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Yoga is not the patched coat, Yoga is not the walking stick. Yoga is not smearing the body with ashes.
Yoga is not the ear-rings, and not the shaven head. Yoga is not the blowing of the horn.
Remaining unblemished in the midst of the filth of the world - this is the way to attain Yoga. ||1||
By mere words, Yoga is not attained.
One who looks upon all with a single eye, and knows them to be one and the same - he alone is known as a Yogi. ||1||Pause||
Yoga is not wandering to the tombs of the dead; Yoga is not sitting in trances.
Yoga is not wandering through foreign lands; Yoga is not bathing at sacred shrines of pilgrimage.
Remaining unblemished in the midst of the filth of the world - this is the way to attain Yoga. ||2||
Meeting with the True Guru, doubt is dispelled, and the wandering mind is restrained.
Nectar rains down, celestial music resounds, and deep within, wisdom is obtained.
Remaining unblemished in the midst of the filth of the world - this is the way to attain Yoga. ||3||
O Nanak, remain dead while yet alive - practice such a Yoga.
When the horn is blown without being blown, then you shall attain the state of fearless dignity.
Remaining unblemished in the midst of the filth of the world - this is the way to attain Yoga. ||4||1||8||
Soohee, First Mehl:
What scale, what weights, and what assayer shall I call for You, Lord?
From what guru should I receive instruction? By whom should I have Your value appraised? ||1||
