Safe and sound, we have returned home, while the slanderer's face is blackened.
Says Nanak, my True Guru is Perfect; by the Grace of God and Guru, I am so happy. ||2||27||113||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
I have fallen in love with my Beloved Lord. ||Pause||
Cutting it, it does not break, and releasing it, it does not let go. Such is the string the Lord has tied me with. ||1||
Day and night, He dwells within my mind; please bless me with Your Mercy, O my God. ||2||
I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to my beauteous Lord; I have heard his Unspoken Speech and Story. ||3||
Servant Nanak is said to be the slave of His slaves; O my Lord and Master, please bless me with Your Mercy. ||4||28||114||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
I meditate on the Lord's Feet; I am a sacrifice to Them.
My Guru is the Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent Lord; I enshrine Him within my heart, and meditate on Him within my mind. ||1||Pause||
Meditate, meditate, meditate in remembrance on the Giver of peace, who created the whole Universe.
With your tongue, savor the One Lord, and you shall be honored in the Court of the True Lord. ||1||
He alone obtains this treasure, who joins the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
O Lord and Master, mercifully bless Nanak with this gift, that he may ever sing the Glorious Praises of Your Kirtan. ||2||29||115||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
I have been saved, in the Sanctuary of the True Guru.
I am cheered and applauded throughout the world; my Supreme Lord God carries me across. ||1||Pause||
The Perfect Lord fills the Universe; He is the Giver of peace; He cherishes and fulfills the whole Universe.
He is completely filling all places and interspaces; I am a devoted sacrifice to the Lord's Feet. ||1||
The ways of all beings are in Your Power, O my Lord and Master. All supernatural spiritual powers are Yours; You are the Creator, the Cause of causes.
In the beginning, and throughout the ages, God is our Savior and Protector; remembering the Lord in meditation, O Nanak, fear is eliminated. ||2||30||116||
Raag Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl, Du-Padas, Eighth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
I am nothing, God; everything is Yours.
In this world, You are the absolute, formless Lord; in the world hereafter, You are the related Lord of form. You play it both ways, O my Lord and Master. ||1||Pause||
You exist within the city, and beyond it as well; O my God, You are everywhere.
You Yourself are the King, and You Yourself are the subject. In one place, You are the Lord and Master, and in another place, You are the slave. ||1||
From whom should I hide? Whom should I try to deceive? Wherever I look, I see Him near at hand.
I have met with Guru Nanak, the Embodiment of the Holy Saints. When the drop of water merges into the ocean, it cannot be distinguished as separate again. ||2||1||117||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
