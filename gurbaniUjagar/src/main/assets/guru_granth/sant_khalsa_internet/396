That humble being, O Nanak, unto whom the Guru grants His Mercy,
that person is forever enraptured. ||4||6||100||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The True Guru has truly given a child.
The long-lived one has been born to this destiny.
He came to acquire a home in the womb,
and his mother's heart is so very glad. ||1||
A son is born - a devotee of the Lord of the Universe.
This pre-ordained destiny has been revealed to all. ||Pause||
In the tenth month, by the Lord's Order, the baby has been born.
Sorrow is dispelled, and great joy has ensued.
The companions blissfully sing the songs of the Guru's Bani.
This is pleasing to the Lord Master. ||2||
The vine has grown, and shall last for many generations.
The Power of the Dharma has been firmly established by the Lord.
That which my mind wishes for, the True Guru has granted.
I have become carefree, and I fix my attention on the One Lord. ||3||
As the child places so much faith in his father,
I speak as it pleases the Guru to have me speak.
This is not a hidden secret;
Guru Nanak, greatly pleased, has bestowed this gift. ||4||7||101||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Giving His Hand, the Perfect Guru has protected the child.
The glory of His servant has become manifest. ||1||
I contemplate the Guru, the Guru; I meditate on the Guru, the Guru.
I offer my heart-felt prayer to the Guru, and it is answered. ||Pause||
I have taken to the Sanctuary of the True Divine Guru.
The service of His servant has been fulfilled. ||2||
He has preserved my soul, body, youth and breath of life.
Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to the Guru. ||3||8||102||
Aasaa, Eighth House, Kaafee, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
I am Your purchased slave, O True Lord Master.
My soul and body, and all of this, everything is Yours. ||1||
You are the honor of the dishonored. O Master, in You I place my trust.
Without the True One, any other support is false - know this well. ||1||Pause||
Your Command is infinite; no one can find its limit.
One who meets with the Perfect Guru, walks in the Way of the Lord's Will. ||2||
Cunning and cleverness are of no use.
That which the Lord Master gives, by the Pleasure of His Will - that is pleasing to me. ||3||
One may perform tens of thousands of actions, but attachment to things is not satisfied.
Servant Nanak has made the Naam his Support. He has renounced other entanglements. ||4||1||103||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
I have pursued all pleasures, but none is as great as the Lord.
By the Pleasure of the Guru's Will, the True Lord Master is obtained. ||1||
I am a sacrifice to my Guru; I am forever and ever a sacrifice to Him.
Please, grant me this one blessing, that I may never, even for an instant, forget Your Name. ||1||Pause||
How very fortunate are those who have the wealth of the Lord deep within the heart.
