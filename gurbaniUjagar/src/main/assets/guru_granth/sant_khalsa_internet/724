You are, You are, and You shall ever be,
O inaccessible, unfathomable, lofty and infinite Lord.
Those who serve You, are not touched by fear or suffering.
By Guru's Grace, O Nanak, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||2||
Whatever is seen, is Your form,
O treasure of virtue, O Lord of the Universe, O Lord of incomparable beauty.
Remembering, remembering, remembering the Lord in meditation, His humble servant becomes like Him.
O Nanak, by His Grace, we obtain Him. ||3||
I am a sacrifice to those who meditate on the Lord.
Associating with them, the whole world is saved.
Says Nanak, God fulfills our hopes and aspirations.
I long for the dust of the feet of the Saints. ||4||2||
Tilang, Fifth Mehl, Third House:
Merciful, the Lord Master is Merciful.
My Lord Master is Merciful.
He gives His gifts to all beings. ||Pause||
Why do you waver, O mortal being? The Creator Lord Himself shall protect you.
He who created you, will also give you nourishment. ||1||
The One who created the world, takes care of it.
In each and every heart and mind, the Lord is the True Cherisher. ||2||
His creative potency and His value cannot be known; He is the Great and carefree Lord.
O human being, meditate on the Lord, as long as there is breath in your body. ||3||
O God, You are all-powerful, inexpressible and imperceptible; my soul and body are Your capital.
By Your Mercy, may I find peace; this is Nanak's lasting prayer. ||4||3||
Tilang, Fifth Mehl, Third House:
O Creator, through Your creative potency, I am in love with You.
You alone are my spiritual and temporal Lord; and yet, You are detached from all Your creation. ||Pause||
In an instant, You establish and disestablish. Wondrous is Your form!
Who can know Your play? You are the Light in the darkness. ||1||
You are the Master of Your creation, the Lord of all the world, O Merciful Lord God.
One who worships You day and night - why should he have to go to hell? ||2||
Azraa-eel, the Messenger of Death, is the friend of the human being who has Your support, Lord.
His sins are all forgiven; Your humble servant gazes upon Your Vision. ||3||
All worldly considerations are for the present only. True peace comes only from Your Name.
Meeting the Guru, Nanak understands; He sings only Your Praises forever, O Lord. ||4||4||
Tilang, Fifth Mehl:
Think of the Lord in your mind, O wise one.
Enshrine love for the True Lord in your mind and body; He is the Liberator from bondage. ||1||Pause||
The value of seeing the Vision of the Lord Master cannot be estimated.
You are the Pure Cherisher; You Yourself are the great and immeasurable Lord and Master. ||1||
Give me Your help, O brave and generous Lord; You are the One, You are the Only Lord.
O Creator Lord, by Your creative potency, You created the world; Nanak holds tight to Your support. ||2||5||
Tilang, First Mehl, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The One who created the world watches over it; what more can we say, O Siblings of Destiny?
