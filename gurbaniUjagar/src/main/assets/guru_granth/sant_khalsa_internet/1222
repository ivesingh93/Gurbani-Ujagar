Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
The Lord, Har, Har, is the life of the humble Saints.
Instead of enjoying corrupt pleasures, they drink in the Ambrosial Essence of the Name of the Lord, the Ocean of Peace. ||1||Pause||
They gather up the priceless wealth of the Lord's Name, and weave it into the fabric of their mind and body.
Imbued with the Lord's Love, their minds are dyed in the deep crimson color of devotional love; they are intoxicated with the sublime essence of the Lord's Name. ||1||
As the fish is immersed in water, they are absorbed in the Lord's Name.
O Nanak, the Saints are like the rain-birds; they are comforted, drinking in the drops of the Lord's Name. ||2||68||91||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Without the Name of the Lord, the mortal is a ghost.
All the actions he commits are just shackles and bonds. ||1||Pause||
Without serving God, one who serves another wastes his time uselessly.
When the Messenger of Death comes to kill you, O mortal, what will your condition be then? ||1||
Please protect Your slave, O Eternally Merciful Lord.
O Nanak, my God is the Treasure of Peace; He is the wealth and property of the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||2||69||92||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
My mind and body deal only in the Lord.
Imbued with loving devotional worship, I sing His Glorious Praises; I am not affected by worldly affairs. ||1||Pause||
This is the way of life of the Holy Saint: he listens to the Kirtan, the Praises of his Lord and Master, and meditates in remembrance on Him.
He implants the Lord's Lotus Feet deep within his heart; worship of the Lord is the support of his breath of life. ||1||
O God, Merciful to the meek, please hear my prayer, and shower Your Blessings upon me.
I continually chant the treasure of the Naam with my tongue; Nanak is forever a sacrifice. ||2||70||93||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Without the Name of the Lord, his intellect is shallow.
He does not meditate in remembrance on the Lord, his Lord and Master; the blind fool suffers in terrible agony. ||1||Pause||
He does not embrace love for the Name of the Lord; he is totally attached to various religious robes.
His attachments are shattered in an instant; when the pitcher is broken, the water runs out. ||1||
Please bless me, that I may worship You in loving devotion. My mind is absorbed and intoxicated with Your Delicious Love.
Nanak, Your slave, has entered Your Sanctuary; without God, there is no other at all. ||2||71||94||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
In my mind, I think about that moment,
when I join the Gathering of the Friendly Saints, constantly singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe. ||1||Pause||
Without vibrating and meditating on the Lord, whatever deeds you do will be useless.
The Perfect Embodiment of Supreme Bliss is so sweet to my mind. Without Him, there is no other at all. ||1||
Chanting, deep meditation, austere self-discipline, good deeds and other techniques to being peace - they are not equal to even a tiny bit of the Lord's Name.
Nanak's mind is pierced through by the Lotus Feet of the Lord; it is absorbed in His Lotus Feet. ||2||72||95||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
My God is always with me; He is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.
I find happiness in the world hereafter, and peace and pleasure in this world, meditating in remembrance on the Name of my Lord and Master. ||1||Pause||
