Caught in slander and attachment to the wealth and women of others, they eat poison and suffer in pain.
They think about the Shabad, but they are not released from their fear and fraud; the minds and mouths are filled with Maya, Maya.
Loading the heavy and crushing load, they die, only to be reborn, and waste their lives again. ||1||
The Word of the Shabad is so very beautiful; it is pleasing to my mind.
The mortal wanders lost in reincarnation, wearing various robes and clothes; when he is saved and protected by the Guru, then he finds the Truth. ||1||Pause||
He does not try to wash away his angry passions by bathing at sacred shrines. He does not love the Name of the Lord.
He abandons and discards the priceless jewel, and he goes back from where he came.
And so he becomes a maggot in manure, and in that, he is absorbed.
The more he tastes, the more he is diseased; without the Guru, there is no peace and poise. ||2||
Focusing my awareness on selfless service, I joyfully sing His Praises. As Gurmukh, I contemplate spiritual wisdom.
The seeker comes forth, and the debater dies down; I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to the Guru, the Creator Lord.
I am low and wretched, with shallow and false understanding; You embellish and exalt me through the Word of Your Shabad.
And wherever there is self-realization, You are there; O True Lord Savior, You save us and carry us across. ||3||
Where should I sit to chant Your Praises; which of Your Infinite Praises should I chant?
The Unknown cannot be known; O Inaccessible, Unborn Lord God, You are the Lord and Master of masters.
How can I compare You to anyone else I see? All are beggars - You are the Great Giver.
Lacking devotion, Nanak looks to Your Door; please bless him with Your One Name, that he may enshrine it in his heart. ||4||3||
Malaar, First Mehl:
The soul-bride who has not known delight with her Husband Lord, shall weep and wail with a wretched face.
She becomes hopeless, caught in the noose of her own karma; without the Guru, she wanders deluded by doubt. ||1||
So rain down, O clouds. My Husband Lord has come home.
I am a sacrifice to my Guru, who has led me to meet my Lord God. ||1||Pause||
My love, my Lord and Master is forever fresh; I am embellished with devotional worship night and day.
I am liberated, gazing on the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan. Devotional worship has made me glorious and exalted throughout the ages. ||2||
I am Yours; the three worlds are Yours as well. You are mine, and I am Yours.
Meeting with the True Guru, I have found the Immaculate Lord; I shall not be consigned to this terrifying world-ocean ever again. ||3||
If the soul-bride is filled with delight on seeing her Husband Lord, then her decorations are true.
With the Immaculate Celestial Lord, she becomes the truest of the true. Following the Guru's Teachings, she leans on the Support of the Naam. ||4||
She is liberated; the Guru has untied her bonds. Focusing her awareness on the Shabad, she attains honor.
O Nanak, the Lord's Name is deep within her heart; as Gurmukh, she is united in His Union. ||5||4||
First Mehl, Malaar:
Others' wives, others' wealth, greed, egotism, corruption and poison;
evil passions, slander of others, sexual desire and anger - give up all these. ||1||
The Inaccessible, Infinite Lord is sitting in His Mansion.
That humble being, whose conduct is in harmony with the jewel of the Guru's Shabad, obtains the Ambrosial Nectar. ||1||Pause||
