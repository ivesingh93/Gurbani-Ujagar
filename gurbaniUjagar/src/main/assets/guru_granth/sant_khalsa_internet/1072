One who has the Name of the Lord has hundreds of thousands and millions of arms.

In His Mercy, God has blessed me with the sword of spiritual wisdom; I have attacked and killed the demons. ||9||
Chant the Chant of the Lord, the Chant of Chants.

O God, I have enshrined faith in You within my mind.
My egotistical intellect has been driven out.

Proclaim His Glorious Victory, and meditate on the Lord of the Universe.
I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to my Lord God.
I do not see any other except Him. The One Lord pervades the whole world. ||14||

Maaroo, Solahas, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The body-bride is attached to the Yogi, the husband-soul.
She is involved with him, enjoying pleasure and delights.
As a consequence of past actions, they have come together, enjoying pleasurable play. ||1||
Whatever the husband does, the bride willingly accepts.
The husband adorns his bride, and keeps her with himself.
Joining together, they live in harmony day and night; the husband comforts his wife. ||2||
When the bride asks, the husband runs around in all sorts of ways.
Whatever he finds, he brings to show his bride.
But there is one thing he cannot reach, and so his bride remains hungry and thirsty. ||3||
With her palms pressed together, the bride offers her prayer,
O my beloved, do not leave me and go to foreign lands; please stay here with me.
Do such business within our home, that my hunger and thirst may be relieved."||4||
All sorts of religious rituals are performed in this age,
but without the sublime essence of the Lord, not an iota of peace is found.
When the Lord becomes Merciful, O Nanak, then in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, the bride and the husband enjoy ecstasy and bliss. ||5||
