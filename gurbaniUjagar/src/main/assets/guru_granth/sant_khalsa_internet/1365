They take the noose and run around; but rest assured that God shall destroy them. ||10||
Kabeer, the sandalwood tree is good, even though it is surrounded by weeds.
Those who dwell near the sandalwood tree, become just like the sandalwood tree. ||11||
Kabeer, the bamboo is drowned in its egotistical pride. No one should drown like this.
Bamboo also dwells near the sandalwood tree, but it does not take up its fragrance. ||12||
Kabeer, the mortal loses his faith, for the sake of the world, but the world shall not go along with him in the end.
The idiot strikes his own foot with the axe by his own hand. ||13||
Kabeer, wherever I go, I see wonders everywhere.
But without the devotees of the One Lord, it is all wilderness to me. ||14||
Kabeer, the dwelling of the Saints is good; the dwelling of the unrighteous burns like an oven.
Those mansions in which the Lord's Name is not chanted might just as well burn down. ||15||
Kabeer, why cry at the death of a Saint? He is just going back to his home.
Cry for the wretched, faithless cynic, who is sold from store to store. ||16||
Kabeer, the faithless cynic is like a piece of garlic.
Even if you eat it sitting in a corner, it becomes obvious to everyone. ||17||
Kabeer, Maya is the butter-churn, and the breath is the churning-stick.
The Saints eat the butter, while the world drinks the whey. ||18||
Kabeer, Maya is the butter-churn; the breath flows like ice water.
Whoever does the churning eats the butter; the others are just churning-sticks. ||19||
Kabeer, Maya is the thief, which breaks in and plunders the store.
Only Kabeer is not plundered; he has cut her into twelve pieces. ||20||
Kabeer, peace does not come in this world by making lots of friends.
Those who keep their consciousness focused on the One Lord shall find eternal peace. ||21||
Kabeer, the world is afraid of death - that death fills my mind with bliss.
It is only by death that perfect, supreme bliss is obtained. ||22||
The Treasure of the Lord is obtained, O Kabeer, but do not undo its knot.
There is no market to sell it, no appraiser, no customer, and no price. ||23||
Kabeer, be in love with only that one, whose Master is the Lord.
The Pandits, the religious scholars, kings and landlords - what good is love for them? ||24||
Kabeer, when you are in love with the One Lord, duality and alienation depart.
You may have long hair, or you may shave your head bald. ||25||
Kabeer, the world is a room filled with black soot; the blind fall into its trap.
I am a sacrifice to those who are thrown in, and still escape. ||26||
Kabeer, this body shall perish; save it, if you can.
Even those who have tens of thousands and millions, must depart bare-footed in the end. ||27||
Kabeer, this body shall perish; place it on the path.
Either join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, or sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||28||
Kabeer, dying, dying, the whole world has to die, and yet, none know how to die.
