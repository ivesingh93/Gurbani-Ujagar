I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who hear and enshrine the Naam within their minds.
The Dear Lord, the True One, the Highest of the High, subdues their ego and blends them with Himself. ||1||Pause||
True is the Dear Lord, and True is His Name.
By Guru's Grace, some merge with Him.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, those who merge with the Lord shall not be separated from Him again. They merge with intuitive ease into the True Lord. ||2||
There is nothing beyond You;
You are the One who does, sees, and knows.
The Creator Himself acts, and inspires others to act. Through the Guru's Teachings, He blends us into Himself. ||3||
The virtuous soul-bride finds the Lord;
she decorates herself with the Love and the Fear of God.
She who serves the True Guru is forever a happy soul-bride. She is absorbed in the true teachings. ||4||
Those who forget the Word of the Shabad have no home and no place of rest.
They are deluded by doubt, like a crow in a deserted house.
They forfeit both this world and the next, and they pass their lives suffering in pain and misery. ||5||
Writing on and on endlessly, they run out of paper and ink.
Through the love with duality, no one has found peace.
They write falsehood, and they practice falsehood; they are burnt to ashes by focusing their consciousness on falsehood. ||6||
The Gurmukhs write and reflect on Truth, and only Truth.
The true ones find the gate of salvation.
True is their paper, pen and ink; writing Truth, they are absorbed in the True One. ||7||
My God sits deep within the self; He watches over us.
Those who meet the Lord, by Guru's Grace, are acceptable.
O Nanak, glorious greatness is received through the Naam, which is obtained through the Perfect Guru. ||8||22||23||
Maajh, Third Mehl:
The Divine Light of the Supreme Soul shines forth from the Guru.
The filth stuck to the ego is removed through the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
One who is imbued with devotional worship to the Lord night and day becomes pure. Worshipping the Lord, He is obtained. ||1||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who themselves worship the Lord, and inspire others to worship Him as well.
I humbly bow to those devotees who chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord, night and day. ||1||Pause||
The Creator Lord Himself is the Doer of deeds.
As He pleases, He applies us to our tasks.
Through perfect destiny, we serve the Guru; serving the Guru, peace is found. ||2||
Those who die, and remain dead while yet alive, obtain it.
By Guru's Grace, they enshrine the Lord within their minds.
Enshrining the Lord within their minds, they are liberated forever. With intuitive ease, they merge into the Lord. ||3||
They perform all sorts of rituals, but they do not obtain liberation through them.
They wander around the countryside, and in love with duality, they are ruined.
The deceitful lose their lives in vain; without the Word of the Shabad, they obtain only misery. ||4||
Those who restrain their wandering mind, keeping it steady and stable,
obtain the supreme status, by Guru's Grace.
The True Guru Himself unites us in Union with the Lord. Meeting the Beloved, peace is obtained. ||5||
