One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:
Raag Todee, Chau-Padas, Fourth Mehl, First House:
Without the Lord, my mind cannot survive.
If the Guru unites me with my Beloved Lord God, my breath of life, then I shall not have to face the wheel of reincarnation again in the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||Pause||
My heart is gripped by a yearning for my Lord God, and with my eyes, I behold my Lord God.
The merciful True Guru has implanted the Name of the Lord within me; this is the Path leading to my Lord God. ||1||
Through the Lord's Love, I have found the Naam, the Name of my Lord God, the Lord of the Universe, the Lord my God.
The Lord seems so very sweet to my heart, mind and body; upon my face, upon my forehead, my good destiny is inscribed. ||2||
Those whose minds are attached to greed and corruption forget the Lord, the good Lord God.
Those self-willed manmukhs are called foolish and ignorant; misfortune and bad destiny are written on their foreheads. ||3||
From the True Guru, I have obtained a discriminating intellect; the Guru has revealed the spiritual wisdom of God.
Servant Nanak has obtained the Naam from the Guru; such is the destiny inscribed upon his forehead. ||4||1||
Todee, Fifth Mehl, First House, Du-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The Saints do not know any other.
They are carefree, ever in the Lord's Love; the Lord and Master is on their side. ||Pause||
Your canopy is so high, O Lord and Master; no one else has any power.
Such is the immortal Lord and Master the devotees have found; the spiritually wise remain absorbed in His Love. ||1||
Disease, sorrow, pain, old age and death do not even approach the humble servant of the Lord.
They remain fearless, in the Love of the One Lord; O Nanak, they have surrendered their minds to the Lord. ||2||1||
Todee, Fifth Mehl:
Forgetting the Lord, one is ruined forever.
How can anyone be deceived, who has Your Support, O Lord? ||Pause||
