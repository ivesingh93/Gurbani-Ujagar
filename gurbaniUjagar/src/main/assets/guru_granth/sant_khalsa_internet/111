He created the 8.4 million species of beings.
Those, upon whom He casts His Glance of Grace, come to meet the Guru.
Shedding their sins, His servants are forever pure; at the True Court, they are beautified by the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||6||
When they are called to settle their accounts, who will answer then?
There shall be no peace then, from counting out by twos and threes.
The True Lord God Himself forgives, and having forgiven, He unites them with Himself. ||7||
He Himself does, and He Himself causes all to be done.
Through the Shabad, the Word of the Perfect Guru, He is met.
O Nanak, through the Naam, greatness is obtained. He Himself unites in His Union. ||8||2||3||
Maajh, Third Mehl:
The One Lord Himself moves about imperceptibly.
As Gurmukh, I see Him, and then this mind is pleased and uplifted.
Renouncing desire, I have found intuitive peace and poise; I have enshrined the One within my mind. ||1||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who focus their consciousness on the One.
Through the Guru's Teachings, my mind has come to its only home; it is imbued with the True Color of the Lord's Love. ||1||Pause||
This world is deluded; You Yourself have deluded it.
Forgetting the One, it has become engrossed in duality.
Night and day, it wanders around endlessly, deluded by doubt; without the Name, it suffers in pain. ||2||
Those who are attuned to the Love of the Lord, the Architect of Destiny -
by serving the Guru, they are known throughout the four ages.
Those, upon whom the Lord bestows greatness, are absorbed in the Name of the Lord. ||3||
Being in love with Maya, they do not think of the Lord.
Bound and gagged in the City of Death, they suffer in terrible pain.
Blind and deaf, they see nothing at all; the self-willed manmukhs rot away in sin. ||4||
Those, whom You attach to Your Love, are attuned to Your Love.
Through loving devotional worship, they become pleasing to Your Mind.
They serve the True Guru, the Giver of eternal peace, and all their desires are fulfilled. ||5||
O Dear Lord, I seek Your Sanctuary forever.
You Yourself forgive us, and bless us with Glorious Greatness.
The Messenger of Death does not draw near those who meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||6||
Night and day, they are attuned to His Love; they are pleasing to the Lord.
My God merges with them, and unites them in Union.
Forever and ever, O True Lord, I seek the Protection of Your Sanctuary; You Yourself inspire us to understand the Truth. ||7||
Those who know the Truth are absorbed in Truth.
They sing the Lord's Glorious Praises, and speak the Truth.
O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Naam remain unattached and balanced; in the home of the inner self, they are absorbed in the primal trance of deep meditation. ||8||3||4||
Maajh, Third Mehl:
One who dies in the Word of the Shabad is truly dead.
Death does not crush him, and pain does not afflict him.
His light merges and is absorbed into the Light, when he hears and merges in the Truth. ||1||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to the Lord's Name, which brings us to glory.
One who serves the True Guru, and focuses his consciousness on Truth, following the Guru's Teachings, is absorbed in intuitive peace and poise. ||1||Pause||
This human body is transitory, and transitory are the garments it wears.
Attached to duality, no one attains the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.
