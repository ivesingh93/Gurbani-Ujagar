Bestowing Your Mercy, God, You attach us to Your Name; all peace comes by Your Will. ||Pause||
The Lord is Ever-present; one who deems Him to be far away,
that person dies again and again, repenting. ||2||
The mortals do not remember the One, who has given them everything.
Engrossed in such terrible corruption, their days and nights waste away. ||3||
Says Nanak, meditate in remembrance of the One Lord God.
Salvation is obtained, in the Shelter of the Perfect Guru. ||4||3||97||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the mind and body are totally rejuvenated.
All sins and sorrows are washed away. ||1||
How blessed is that day, O my Siblings of Destiny,
when the Glorious Praises of the Lord are sung, and the supreme status is obtained. ||Pause||
Worshipping the feet of the Holy Saints,
troubles and hatred are eliminated from the mind. ||2||
Meeting with the Perfect Guru, conflict is ended,
and the five demons are totally subdued. ||3||
One whose mind is filled with the Name of the Lord,
O Nanak - I am a sacrifice to him. ||4||4||98||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
O singer, sing of the One,
who is the Support of the soul, the body and the breath of life.
Serving Him, all peace is obtained.
You shall no longer go to any other. ||1||
My Blissful Lord Master is forever in bliss; meditate continually and forever, on the Lord, the treasure of excellence.
I am a sacrifice to the Beloved Saints; by their kind favor, God comes to dwell in the mind. ||Pause||
His gifts are never exhausted.
In His subtle way, He easily absorbs all.
His benevolence cannot be erased.
So enshrine that True Lord within your mind. ||2||
His house is filled with all sorts of articles;
God's servants never suffer pain.
Holding to His Support, the state of fearless dignity is obtained.
With each and every breath, sing of the Lord, the treasure of excellence. ||3||
He is not far from us, wherever we go.
When He shows His Mercy, we obtain the Lord, Har, Har.
I offer this prayer to the Perfect Guru.
Nanak begs for the treasure of the Lord's Name. ||4||5||99||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
First, the pains of the body vanish;
then, the mind becomes totally peaceful.
In His Mercy, the Guru bestows the Lord's Name.
I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to that True Guru. ||1||
I have obtained the Perfect Guru, O my Siblings of Destiny.
All illness, sorrows and sufferings are dispelled, in the Sanctuary of the True Guru. ||Pause||
The feet of the Guru abide within my heart;
I have received all the fruits of my heart's desires.
The fire is extinguished, and I am totally peaceful.
Showering His Mercy, the Guru has given this gift. ||2||
The Guru has given shelter to the shelterless.
The Guru has given honor to the dishonored.
Shattering his bonds, the Guru has saved His servant.
I taste with my tongue the Ambrosial Bani of His Word. ||3||
By great good fortune, I worship the Guru's feet.
Forsaking everything, I have obtained God's Sanctuary.
