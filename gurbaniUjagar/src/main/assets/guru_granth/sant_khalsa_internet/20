The body of the five elements is dyed in the Fear of the True One; the mind is filled with the True Light.
O Nanak, your demerits shall be forgotten; the Guru shall preserve your honor. ||4||15||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
O Nanak, the Boat of Truth will ferry you across; contemplate the Guru.
Some come, and some go; they are totally filled with egotism.
Through stubborn-mindedness, the intellect is drowned; one who becomes Gurmukh and truthful is saved. ||1||
Without the Guru, how can anyone swim across to find peace?
As it pleases You, Lord, You save me. There is no other for me at all. ||1||Pause||
In front of me, I see the jungle burning; behind me, I see green plants sprouting.
We shall merge into the One from whom we came. The True One is pervading each and every heart.
He Himself unites us in Union with Himself; the True Mansion of His Presence is close at hand. ||2||
With each and every breath, I dwell upon You; I shall never forget You.
The more the Lord and Master dwells within the mind, the more the Gurmukh drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar.
Mind and body are Yours; You are my Master. Please rid me of my pride, and let me merge with You. ||3||
The One who formed this universe created the creation of the three worlds.
The Gurmukh knows the Divine Light, while the foolish self-willed manmukh gropes around in the darkness.
One who sees that Light within each and every heart understands the Essence of the Guru's Teachings. ||4||
Those who understand are Gurmukh; recognize and applaud them.
They meet and merge with the True One. They become the Radiant Manifestation of the Excellence of the True One.
O Nanak, they are contented with the Naam, the Name of the Lord. They offer their bodies and souls to God. ||5||16||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
Listen, O my mind, my friend, my darling: now is the time to meet the Lord.
As long as there is youth and breath, give this body to Him.
Without virtue, it is useless; the body shall crumble into a pile of dust. ||1||
O my mind, earn the profit, before you return home.
The Gurmukh praises the Naam, and the fire of egotism is extinguished. ||1||Pause||
Again and again, we hear and tell stories; we read and write and understand loads of knowledge,
but still, desires increase day and night, and the disease of egotism fills us with corruption.
That Carefree Lord cannot be appraised; His Real Value is known only through the Wisdom of the Guru's Teachings. ||2||
Even if someone has hundreds of thousands of clever mental tricks, and the love and company of hundreds of thousands of people -
still, without the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, he will not feel satisfied. Without the Name, all suffer in sorrow.
Chanting the Name of the Lord, O my soul, you shall be emancipated; as Gurmukh, you shall come to understand your own self. ||3||
I have sold my body and mind to the Guru, and I have given my mind and head as well.
I was seeking and searching for Him throughout the three worlds; then, as Gurmukh, I sought and found Him.
The True Guru has united me in Union, O Nanak, with that God. ||4||17||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
I have no anxiety about dying, and no hope of living.
You are the Cherisher of all beings; You keep the account of our breaths and morsels of food.
You abide within the Gurmukh. As it pleases You, You decide our allotment. ||1||
O my soul, chant the Name of the Lord; the mind will be pleased and appeased.
The raging fire within is extinguished; the Gurmukh obtains spiritual wisdom. ||1||Pause||
