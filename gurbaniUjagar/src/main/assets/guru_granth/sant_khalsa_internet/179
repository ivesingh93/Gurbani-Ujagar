O my mind, hold tight to the Support of the Lord's Name.
The hot winds shall never even touch you. ||1||Pause||
Like a boat in the ocean of fear;
like a lamp which illumines the darkness;
like fire which takes away the pain of cold -
just so, chanting the Name, the mind becomes peaceful. ||2||
The thirst of your mind shall be quenched,
and all hopes shall be fulfilled.
Your consciousness shall not waver.
Meditate on the Ambrosial Naam as Gurmukh, O my friend. ||3||
He alone receives the panacea, the medicine of the Naam,
unto whom the Lord, in His Grace, bestows it.
One whose heart is filled with the Name of the Lord, Har, Har -
O Nanak, his pains and sorrows are eliminated. ||4||10||79||
Gauree Gwaarayree, Fifth Mehl:
Even with vast sums of wealth, the mind is not satisfied.
Gazing upon countless beauties, the man is not satisfied.
He is so involved with his wife and sons - he believes that they belong to him.
That wealth shall pass away, and those relatives shall be reduced to ashes. ||1||
Without meditating and vibrating on the Lord, they are crying out in pain.
Their bodies are cursed, and their wealth is cursed - they are imbued with Maya. ||1||Pause||
The servant carries the bags of money on his head,
but it goes to his master's house, and he receives only pain.
The man sits as a king in his dreams,
but when he opens his eyes, he sees that it was all in vain. ||2||
The watchman oversees the field of another,
but the field belongs to his master, while he must get up and depart.
He works so hard, and suffers for that field,
but still, nothing comes into his hands. ||3||
The dream is His, and the kingdom is His;
He who has given the wealth of Maya, has infused the desire for it.
He Himself annihilates, and He Himself restores.
Nanak offers this prayer to God. ||4||11||80||
Gauree Gwaarayree, Fifth Mehl:
I have gazed upon the many forms of Maya, in so many ways.
With pen and paper, I have written clever things.
I have seen what it is to be a chief, a king, and an emperor,
but they do not satisfy the mind. ||1||
Show me that peace, O Saints,
which will quench my thirst and satisfy my mind. ||1||Pause||
You may have horses as fast as the wind, elephants to ride on,
sandalwood oil, and beautiful women in bed,
actors in dramas, singing in theaters -
but even with them, the mind does not find contentment. ||2||
You may have a throne at the royal court, with beautiful decorations and soft carpets,
all sorts of luscious fruits and beautiful gardens,
the excitement of the chase and princely pleasures -
but still, the mind is not made happy by such illusory diversions. ||3||
In their kindness, the Saints have told me of the True One,
and so I have obtained all comforts and joy.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I sing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises.
Says Nanak, through great good fortune, I have found this. ||4||
One who obtains the wealth of the Lord becomes happy.
By God's Grace, I have joined the Saadh Sangat. ||1||Second. Pause||12||81||
