Be merciful, O Perfect God, Great Giver, that slave Nanak may chant Your immaculate Praises. ||2||17||103||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
The Lord saved me from Sulhi Khan.
The emperor did not succeed in his plot, and he died in disgrace. ||1||Pause||
The Lord and Master raised His axe, and chopped off his head; in an instant, he was reduced to dust. ||1||
Plotting and planning evil, he was destroyed. The One who created him, gave him a push.
Of his sons, friends and wealth, nothing remains; he departed, leaving behind all his brothers and relatives.
Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to God, who fulfilled the word of His slave. ||2||18||104||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Perfect is service to the Perfect Guru.
Our Lord and Master Himself is Himself all-pervading. The Divine Guru has resolved all my affairs. ||1||Pause||
In the beginning, in the middle and in the end, God is our only Lord and Master. He Himself fashioned His Creation.
He Himself saves His servant. Great is the glorious grandeur of my God! ||1||
The Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent Lord is the True Guru; all beings are in His power.
Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of His Lotus Feet, chanting the Lord's Name, the immaculate Mantra. ||2||19||105||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
He Himself protects me from suffering and sin.
Falling at the Guru's Feet, I am cooled and soothed; I meditate on the Lord's Name within my heart. ||1||Pause||
Granting His Mercy, God has extended His Hands. He is the Emancipator of the World; His glorious radiance pervades the nine continents.
My pain has been dispelled, and peace and pleasure have come; my desire is quenched, and my mind and body are truly satisfied. ||1||
He is the Master of the masterless, All-powerful to give Sanctuary. He is the Mother and Father of the whole Universe.
He is the Lover of His devotees, the Destroyer of fear; Nanak sings and chants the Glorious Praises of his Lord and Master. ||2||20||106||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Acknowledge the One, from whom You originated.
Meditating on the Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent Lord, I have found peace, pleasure and salvation. ||1||Pause||
I met the Perfect Guru, by great good fortune, and so found the wise and all-knowing Lord, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.
He gave me His Hand, and making me His own, He saved me; He is absolutely all-powerful, the honor of the dishonored. ||1||
Doubt and fear have been dispelled in an instant, and in the darkness, the Divine Light shines forth.
With each and every breath, Nanak worships and adores the Lord; forever and ever, I am a sacrifice to Him. ||2||21||107||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Both here and hereafter, the Mighty Guru protects me.
God has embellished this world and the next for me, and all my affairs are perfectly resolved. ||1||Pause||
Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, I have found peace and poise, bathing in the dust of the feet of the Holy.
Comings and goings have ceased, and I have found stability; the pains of birth and death are eradicated. ||1||
I cross over the ocean of doubt and fear, and the fear of death is gone; the One Lord is permeating and pervading in each and every heart.
