The Perfect Supreme Lord God is the Support of His humble servant.
Millions are saved in Your Sanctuary. ||1||Pause||
As many creatures as there are - they are all Yours.

Whatever happens, is all according to Your Will.
One who understands the Hukam of the Lord's Command, is absorbed in the True Lord. ||3||
Please grant Your Grace, God, and bestow this gift
upon Nanak, that he may meditate on the treasure of the Naam. ||4||66||135||

By great good fortune, the Blessed Vision of His Darshan is obtained,
by those who are lovingly absorbed in the Lord's Name. ||1||
Those whose minds are filled with the Lord,
do not suffer pain, even in dreams. ||1||Pause||
All treasures have been placed within the minds of His humble servants.
In their company, sinful mistakes and sorrows are taken away. ||2||
The Glories of the Lord's humble servants cannot be described.
The servants of the Supreme Lord God remain absorbed in Him. ||3||

It alone shall be of use to your soul. ||1||Pause||
Night and day, sing the Glorious Praises of the Infinite Lord,
through the Pure Mantra of the Perfect Guru. ||2||
Give up other efforts, and place your faith in the Support of the One Lord.
Taste the Ambrosial Essence of this, the greatest treasure. ||3||
They alone cross over the treacherous world-ocean,
O Nanak, upon whom the Lord casts His Glance of Grace. ||4||68||137||

I have enshrined the Lotus Feet of God within my heart.
Meeting the Perfect True Guru, I am emancipated. ||1||

Joining the Holy Saints, meditate on the Lord's Name. ||1||Pause||
This human body, so difficult to obtain, is redeemed
when one receives the banner of the Naam from the True Guru. ||2||

In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, fear and doubt depart. ||3||
Wherever I look, there I see the Lord pervading.
Slave Nanak has entered the Lord's Sanctuary. ||4||69||138||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
I am a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan.

O Supreme Lord God, O Perfect Divine Guru,
show mercy to me, and commit me to Your service. ||1||Pause||
I enshrine His Lotus Feet within my heart.
I offer my mind, body and wealth to the Guru, the Support of the breath of life. ||2||
My life is prosperous, fruitful and approved;
I know that the Guru, the Supreme Lord God, is near me. ||3||
By great good fortune, I have obtained the dust of the feet of the Saints.
