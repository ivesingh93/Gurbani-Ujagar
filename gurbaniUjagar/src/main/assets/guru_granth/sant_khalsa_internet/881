O humble servant of the Lord, follow the Guru's Teachings, and chant the Name of the Lord.
Whoever hears and speaks it is liberated; chanting the Lord's Name, one is embellished with beauty. ||1||Pause||
If someone has supremely high destiny written on his forehead, the Lord leads him to meet the humble servants of the Lord.
Be merciful, and grant me the Blessed Vision of the Saints' Darshan, which shall rid me of all poverty and pain. ||2||
The Lord's people are good and sublime; the unfortunate ones do not like them at all.
The more the Lord's exalted servants speak of Him, the more the slanderers attack and sting them. ||3||
Cursed, cursed are the slanderers who do not like the humble, the friends and companions of the Lord.
Those who do not like the honor and glory of the Guru are faithless, black-faced thieves, who have turned their backs on the Lord. ||4||
Have mercy, have mercy, please save me, Dear Lord. I am meek and humble - I seek Your protection.
I am Your child, and You are my father, God. Please forgive servant Nanak and merge him with Yourself. ||5||2||
Raamkalee, Fourth Mehl:
The friends of the Lord, the humble, Holy Saints are sublime; the Lord spreads out His protecting hands above them.
The Gurmukhs are the Holy Saints, pleasing to God; in His mercy, He blends them with Himself. ||1||
O Lord, my mind longs to meet with the humble servants of the Lord.
The sweet, subtle essence of the Lord is immortalizing ambrosia. Meeting the Saints, I drink it in. ||1||Pause||
The Lord's people are the most lofty and exalted. Meeting with them, the most exalted status is obtained.
I am the slave of the slave of the Lord's slaves; my Lord and Master is pleased with me. ||2||
The humble servant serves; one who enshrines love for the Lord in his heart, mind and body is very fortunate.
One who talks too much without love, speaks falsely, and obtains only false rewards. ||3||
Take pity on me, O Lord of the World, O Great Giver; let me fall at the feet of the Saints.
I would cut off my head, and cut it into pieces, O Nanak, and set it down for the Saints to walk upon. ||4||3||
Raamkalee, Fourth Mehl:
If I am blessed with supreme high destiny, I will meet the humble servants of the Lord, without delay.
The Lord's humble servants are pools of ambrosial nectar; by great good fortune, one bathes in them. ||1||
O Lord, let me work for the humble servants of the Lord.
I carry water, wave the fan and grind the corn for them; I massage and wash their feet. I apply the dust of their feet to my forehead. ||1||Pause||
The Lord's humble servants are great, very great, the greatest and most exalted; they lead us to meet the True Guru.
No one else is as great as the True Guru; meeting the True Guru, I meditate on the Lord, the Primal Being. ||2||
Those who seek the Sanctuary of the True Guru find the Lord. My Lord and Master saves their honor.
Some come for their own purposes, and sit before the Guru; they pretend to be in Samaadhi, like storks with their eyes closed. ||3||
Associating with the wretched and the lowly, like the stork and the crow, is like feeding on a carcass of poison.
Nanak: O God, unite me with the Sangat, the Congregation. United with the Sangat, I will become a swan. ||4||4||
