Greed is the dark dungeon, and demerits are the shackles on his feet. ||3||
His wealth constantly batters him, and sin acts as the police officer.
Whether the mortal is good or bad, he is as You look upon him, O Lord. ||4||
The Primal Lord God is called Allah. The Shaykh's turn has now come.
The temples of the gods are subject to taxes; this is what it has come to. ||5||
The Muslim devotional pots, calls to prayer, prayers and prayer mats are everywhere; the Lord appears in blue robes.
In each and every home, everyone uses Muslim greetings; your speech has changed, O people. ||6||
You, O my Lord and Master, are the King of the earth; what power do I have to challenge You?
In the four directions, people bow in humble adoration to You; Your Praises are sung in each and every heart. ||7||
Making pilgrimages to sacred shrines, reading the Simritees and giving donations in charity - these do bring any profit.
O Nanak, glorious greatness is obtained in an instant, remembering the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||8||1||8||
Basant Hindol, Second House, Fourth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Within the body-village there lives a child who cannot hold still, even for an instant.
It makes so many efforts, and grows weary, but still, it wanders restlessly again and again. ||1||
O my Lord and Master, Your child has come home, to be one with You.
Meeting the True Guru, he finds the Perfect Lord. Meditating and vibrating on the Name of the Lord, he receives the Insignia of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
These are dead corpses, these bodies of all the people of the world; the Name of the Lord does not dwell in them.
The Guru leads us to taste the water of the Lord's Name, and then we savor and enjoy it, and our bodies are rejuvenated. ||2||
I have examined and studied and searched my entire body, and as Gurmukh, I behold a miraculous wonder.
All the faithless cynics searched outside and died, but following the Guru's Teachings, I have found the Lord within the home of my own heart. ||3||
God is Merciful to the meekest of the meek; Krishna came to the house of Bidar, a devotee of low social status.
Sudama loved God, who came to meet him; God sent everything to his home, and ended his poverty. ||4||
Great is the glory of the Name of the Lord. My Lord and Master Himself has enshrined it within me.
Even if all the faithless cynics continue slandering me, it is not diminished by even one iota. ||5||
The Lord's Name is the praise of His humble servant. It brings him honor in the ten directions.
The slanderers and the faithless cynics cannot endure it at all; they have set fire to their own houses. ||6||
The humble person meeting with another humble person obtains honor. In the glory of the Lord, their glory shines forth.
The servants of my Lord and Master are loved by the Beloved. They are the slaves of His slaves. ||7||
The Creator Himself is the Water; He Himself unites us in His Union.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh is absorbed in celestial peace and poise, like water blending with water. ||8||1||9||
