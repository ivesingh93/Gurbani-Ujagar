Abandon slander and envy of others.
Reading and studying, they burn, and do not find tranquility.
Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, praise the Naam, the Name of the Lord. The Lord, the Supreme Soul, shall be your helper and companion. ||7||
Abandon sexual desire, anger and wickedness.
Abandon your involvement in egotistical affairs and conflicts.
If you seek the Sanctuary of the True Guru, then you shall be saved. In this way you shall cross over the terrifying world-ocean, O Siblings of Destiny. ||8||
In the hereafter, you shall have to cross over the fiery river of poisonous flames.
No one else will be there; your soul shall be all alone.
The ocean of fire spits out waves of searing flames; the self-willed manmukhs fall into it, and are roasted there. ||9||
Liberation comes from the Guru; He grants this blessing by the Pleasure of His Will.
He alone knows the way, who obtains it.
So ask one who has obtained it, O Siblings of Destiny. Serve the True Guru, and find peace. ||10||
Without the Guru, he dies entangled in sin and corruption.
The Messenger of Death smashes his head and humiliates him.
The slanderous person is not freed of his bonds; he is drowned, slandering others. ||11||
So speak the Truth, and realize the Lord deep within.
He is not far away; look, and see Him.
No obstacles shall block your way; become Gurmukh, and cross over to the other side. This is the way to cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||12||
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides deep within the body.
The Creator Lord is eternal and imperishable.
The soul does not die, and it cannot be killed; God creates and watches over all. Through the Word of the Shabad, His Will is manifest. ||13||
He is immaculate, and has no darkness.
The True Lord Himself sits upon His throne.
The faithless cynics are bound and gagged, and forced to wander in reincarnation. They die, and are reborn, and continue coming and going. ||14||
The Guru's servants are the Beloved of the True Guru.
Contemplating the Shabad, they sit upon His throne.
They realize the essence of reality, and know the state of their inner being. This is the true glorious greatness of those who join the Sat Sangat. ||15||
He Himself saves His humble servant, and saves his ancestors as well.
His companions are liberated; He carries them across.
Nanak is the servant and slave of that Gurmukh who lovingly focuses his consciousness on the Lord. ||16||6||
Maaroo, First Mehl:
For many ages, only darkness prevailed;
the infinite, endless Lord was absorbed in the primal void.
He sat alone and unaffected in absolute darkness; the world of conflict did not exist. ||1||
Thirty-six ages passed like this.
He causes all to happen by the Pleasure of His Will.
No rival of His can be seen. He Himself is infinite and endless. ||2||
God is hidden throughout the four ages - understand this well.
He pervades each and every heart, and is contained within the belly.
The One and Only Lord prevails throughout the ages. How rare are those who contemplate the Guru, and understand this. ||3||
From the union of the sperm and the egg, the body was formed.
From the union of air, water and fire, the living being is made.
He Himself plays joyfully in the mansion of the body; all the rest is just attachment to Maya's expanse. ||4||
Within the mother's womb, upside-down, the mortal meditated on God.
The Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, knows everything.
With each and every breath, he contemplated the True Name, deep within himself, within the womb. ||5||
