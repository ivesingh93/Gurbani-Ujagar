This whole world is the child of Maya.
I bow in submission to God, my Protector from the very beginning of time.
He was in the beginning, He has been throughout the ages, He is now, and He shall always be.
He is unlimited, and capable of doing everything. ||11||
The Tenth Day: Meditate on the Naam, give to charity, and purify yourself.
Night and day, bathe in spiritual wisdom and the Glorious Virtues of the True Lord.
Truth cannot be polluted; doubt and fear run away from it.
The flimsy thread breaks in an instant.
Know that the world is just like this thread.
Your consciousness shall become steady and stable, enjoying the Love of the True Lord. ||12||
The Eleventh Day: Enshrine the One Lord within your heart.
Eradicate cruelty, egotism and emotional attachment.
Earn the fruitful rewards, by observing the fast of knowing your own self.
One who is engrossed in hypocrisy, does not see the true essence.
The Lord is immaculate, self-sustaining and unattached.
The Pure, True Lord cannot be polluted. ||13||
Wherever I look, I see the One Lord there.
He created the other beings, of many and various kinds.
Eating only fruits, one loses the fruits of life.
Eating only delicacies of various sorts, one loses the true taste.
In fraud and greed, people are engrossed and entangled.
The Gurmukh is emancipated, practicing Truth. ||14||
The Twelfth Day: One whose mind is not attached to the twelve signs,
remains awake day and night, and never sleeps.
He remains awake and aware, lovingly centered on the Lord.
With faith in the Guru, he is not consumed by death.
Those who become detached, and conquer the five enemies -
prays Nanak, they are lovingly absorbed in the Lord. ||15||
The Twelfth Day: Know, and practice, compassion and charity.
Bring your out-going mind back home.
Observe the fast of remaining free of desire.
Chant the unchanted Chant of the Naam with your mouth.
Know that the One Lord is contained in the three worlds.
Purity and self-discipline are all contained in knowing the Truth. ||16||
The Thirteenth Day: He is like a tree on the sea-shore.
But his roots can become immortal, if his mind is attuned to the Lord's Love.
Then, he will not dIE of fear or anxiety, and he will never drown.
Without the Fear of God, he drowns and dies, and loses his honor.
With the Fear of God in his heart, and his heart in the Fear of God, he knows God.
He sits on the throne, and becomes pleasing to the Mind of the True Lord. ||17||
The Fourteenth Day: One who enters into the fourth state,
overcomes time, and the three qualities of raajas, taamas and satva.
Then the sun enters into the house of the moon,
and one knows the value of the technology of Yoga.
Who is permeating the fourteen worlds, the nether regions of the underworld,
the galaxies and solar systems; he remains lovingly focused on that God. ||18||
Amaavas - The Night of the New Moon: The moon is hidden in the sky.
O wise one, understand and contemplate the Word of the Shabad.
The moon in the sky illuminates the three worlds.
Creating the creation, the Creator beholds it.
One who sees, through the Guru, merges into Him.
The self-willed manmukhs are deluded, coming and going in reincarnation. ||19||
One who establishes his home within his own heart, obtains the most beautiful, permanent place.
One comes to understand his own self, when he finds the True Guru.
Wherever there is hope, there is destruction and desolation.
The bowl of duality and selfishness breaks.
He who remains detached amidst the traps of attachment,
Prays Nanak, I am the slave of that one. ||20||1||
