Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:
Pride, emotional attachment, greed and corruption are gone; I have not placed anything else, other than the Lord, within my consciousness.
I have purchased the jewel of the Naam and the Glorious Praises of the Lord; loading this merchandise, I have set out on my journey. ||1||
The love which the Lord's servant feels for the Lord lasts forever.
In my life, I served my Lord and Master, and as I depart, I keep Him enshrined in my consciousness. ||1||Pause||
I have not turned my face away from my Lord and Master's Command.
He fills my household with celestial peace and bliss; if He asks me to leave, I leave at once. ||2||
When I am under the Lord's Command, I find even hunger pleasurable; I know no difference between sorrow and joy.
Whatever the Command of my Lord and Master is, I bow my forehead and accept it. ||3||
The Lord and Master has become merciful to His servant; He has embellished both this world and the next.
Blessed is that servant, and fruitful is his birth; O Nanak, he realizes his Lord and Master. ||4||5||
Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:
Good karma has dawned for me - my Lord and Master has become merciful. I sing the Kirtan of the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har.
My struggle is ended; I have found peace and tranquility. All my wanderings have ceased. ||1||
Now, I have obtained the state of eternal life.
The Primal Lord, the Architect of Destiny, has come into my conscious mind; I seek the Sanctuary of the Saints. ||1||Pause||
Sexual desire, anger, greed and emotional attachment are eradicated; all my enemies are eliminated.
He is always ever-present, here and now, watching over me; He is never far away. ||2||
In peace and cool tranquility, my faith has been totally fulfilled; the Saints are my Helpers and Support.
He has purified the sinners in an instant; I cannot express His Glorious Praises. ||3||
I have become fearless; all fear has departed. The feet of the Lord of the Universe are my only Shelter.
Nanak sings the Praises of his Lord and Master; night and day, he is lovingly focused on Him. ||4||6||
Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:
He is all-powerful, the Master of all virtues, but you never sing of Him!
You shall have to leave all this in an instant, but again and again, you chase after it. ||1||
Why do you not contemplate your God?
You are entangled in association with your enemies, and the enjoyment of pleasures; your soul is burning up with them! ||1||Pause||
Hearing His Name, the Messenger of Death will release you, and yet, you do not enter His Sanctuary!
Turn out this wretched jackal, and seek the Shelter of that God. ||2||
Praising Him, you shall cross over the terrifying world-ocean, and yet, you have not fallen in love with Him!
This meager, short-lived dream, this thing - you are engrossed in it, over and over again. ||3||
When our Lord and Master, the ocean of mercy, grants His Grace, one finds honor in the Society of the Saints.
Says Nanak, I am rid of the illusion of the three-phased Maya, when God becomes my help and support. ||4||7||
Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:
The Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, knows everything; what can anyone hide from Him?
Your hands and feet will fall off in an instant, when you are burnt in the fire. ||1||
