The Kaurvas, who had brothers like Duryodhan, used to proclaim, "This is ours! This is ours!
Their royal procession extended over sixty miles, and yet their bodies were eaten by vultures. ||2||
Sri Lanka was totally rich with gold; was anyone greater than its ruler Raavan?
What happened to the elephants, tethered at his gate? In an instant, it all belonged to someone else. ||3||
The Yaadvas deceived Durbaasaa, and received their rewards.
The Lord has shown mercy to His humble servant, and now Naam Dayv sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||4||1||
I have brought the ten sensory organs under my control, and erased every trace of the five thieves.
I have filled the seventy-two thousand nerve channels with Ambrosial Nectar, and drained out the poison. ||1||
I shall not come into the world again.
I chant the Ambrosial Bani of the Word from the depths of my heart, and I have instructed my soul. ||1||Pause||
I fell at the Guru's feet and begged of Him; with the mighty axe, I have chopped off emotional attachment.
Turning away from the world, I have become the servant of the Saints; I fear no one except the Lord's devotees. ||2||
I shall be released from this world, when I stop clinging to Maya.
Maya is the name of the power which causes us to be born; renouncing it, we obtain the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan. ||3||
That humble being, who performs devotional worship in this way, is rid of all fear.
Says Naam Dayv, why are you wandering around out there? This is the way to find the Lord. ||4||2||
As water is very precious in the desert, and the creeper weeds are dear to the camel,
and the tune of the hunter's bell at night is enticing to the deer, so is the Lord to my mind. ||1||
Your Name is so beautiful! Your form is so beautiful! Your Love is so very beautiful, O my Lord. ||1||Pause||
As rain is dear to the earth, and the flower's fragrance is dear to the bumble bee,
and the mango is dear to the cuckoo, so is the Lord to my mind. ||2||
As the sun is dear to the chakvi duck, and the lake of Man Sarovar is dear to the swan,
and the husband is dear to his wife, so is the Lord to my mind. ||3||
As milk is dear to the baby, and the raindrop is dear to the mouth of the rainbird,
and as water is dear to the fish, so is the Lord to my mind. ||4||
All the seekers, Siddhas and silent sages seek Him, but only a rare few behold Him.
Just as Your Name is dear to all the Universe, so is the Lord dear to Naam Dayv's mind. ||5||3||
First of all, the lotuses bloomed in the woods;
from them, all the swan-souls came into being.
Know that, through Krishna, the Lord, Har, Har, the dance of creation dances. ||1||
First of all, there was only the Primal Being.
From that Primal Being, Maya was produced.
All that is, is His.
In this Garden of the Lord, we all dance, like water in the pots of the Persian wheel. ||1||Pause||
Women and men both dance.
There is no other than the Lord.
Don't dispute this,
and don't doubt this.
The Lord says, "This creation and I are one and the same". ||2||
