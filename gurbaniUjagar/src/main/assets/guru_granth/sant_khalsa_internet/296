The most sublime wisdom and purifying baths;
the four cardinal blessings, the opening of the heart-lotus;
in the midst of all, and yet detached from all;
beauty, intelligence, and the realization of reality;
to look impartially upon all, and to see only the One
These blessings come to one who chants the Naam with his mouth,
and hears the Word with his ears through Guru Nanak. ||6||
One who chants this treasure in his mind -
in every age, he attains salvation.
In it is the Glory of God, the Naam, the chanting of Gurbani.
The Simritees, the Shaastras and the Vedas speak of it.
The essence of all religion is the Lord's Name alone.
It abides in the minds of the devotees of God.
Millions of sins are erased, in the Company of the Holy.
By the Grace of the Saint, one escapes the Messenger of Death.
Those, who have such pre-ordained destiny on their foreheads,
O Nanak, enter the Sanctuary of the Saints. ||7||
One, within whose mind it abides, and who listens to it with love -
that humble person consciously remembers the Lord God.
The pains of birth and death are removed.
The human body, so difficult to obtain, is instantly redeemed.
Spotlessly pure is his reputation, and ambrosial is his speech.
The One Name permeates his mind.
Sorrow, sickness, fear and doubt depart.
He is called a Holy person; his actions are immaculate and pure.
His glory becomes the highest of all.
O Nanak, by these Glorious Virtues, this is named Sukhmani, Peace of mind. ||8||24||
T'hitee ~ The Lunar Days: Gauree, Fifth Mehl,
Shalok:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The Creator Lord and Master is pervading the water, the land, and the sky.
In so many ways, the One, the Universal Creator has diffused Himself, O Nanak. ||1||
Pauree:
The first day of the lunar cycle: Bow in humility and meditate on the One, the Universal Creator Lord God.
Praise God, the Lord of the Universe, the Sustainer of the World; seek the Sanctuary of the Lord, our King.
Place your hopes in Him, for salvation and peace; all things come from Him.
I wandered around the four corners of the world and in the ten directions, but I saw nothing except Him.
I listened to the Vedas, the Puraanas and the Simritees, and I pondered over them in so many ways.
The Saving Grace of sinners, the Destroyer of fear, the Ocean of peace, the Formless Lord.
The Great Giver, the Enjoyer, the Bestower - there is no place at all without Him.
You shall obtain all that you desire, O Nanak, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||
Sing the Praises of the Lord, the Lord of the Universe, each and every day.
Join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and vibrate, meditate on Him, O my friend. ||1||Pause||
Shalok:
Bow in humility to the Lord, over and over again, and enter the Sanctuary of the Lord, our King.
Doubt is eradicated, O Nanak, in the Company of the Holy, and the love of duality is eliminated. ||2||
Pauree:
The second day of the lunar cycle: Get rid of your evil-mindedness, and serve the Guru continually.
The jewel of the Lord's Name shall come to dwell in your mind and body, when you renounce sexual desire, anger and greed, O my friend.
Conquer death and obtain eternal life; all your troubles will depart.
Renounce your self-conceit and vibrate upon the Lord of the Universe; loving devotion to Him shall permeate your being.
