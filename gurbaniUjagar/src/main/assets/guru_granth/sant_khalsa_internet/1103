You do not know the exalted state of the Lord's Name; how will you ever cross over? ||1||
You kill living beings, and call it a righteous action. Tell me, brother, what would you call an unrighteous action?
You call yourself the most excellent sage; then who would you call a butcher? ||2||
You are blind in your mind, and do not understand your own self; how can you make others understand, O brother?
For the sake of Maya and money, you sell knowledge; your life is totally worthless. ||3||
Naarad and Vyaasa say these things; go and ask Suk Dayv as well.
Says Kabeer, chanting the Lord's Name, you shall be saved; otherwise, you shall drown, brother. ||4||1||
Living in the forest, how will you find Him? Not until you remove corruption from your mind.
Those who look alike upon home and forest, are the most perfect people in the world. ||1||
You shall find real peace in the Lord,
if you lovingly dwell on the Lord within your being. ||1||Pause||
What is the use of wearing matted hair, smearing the body with ashes, and living in a cave?
Conquering the mind, one conquers the world, and then remains detached from corruption. ||2||
They all apply make-up to their eyes; there is little difference between their objectives.
But those eyes, to which the ointment of spiritual wisdom is applied, are approved and supreme. ||3||
Says Kabeer, now I know my Lord; the Guru has blessed me with spiritual wisdom.
I have met the Lord, and I am emancipated within; now, my mind does not wander at all. ||4||2||
You have riches and miraculous spiritual powers; so what business do you have with anyone else?
What should I say about the reality of your talk? I am embarrassed even to speak to you. ||1||
One who has found the Lord,
does not wander from door to door. ||1||Pause||
The false world wanders all around, in hopes of finding wealth to use for a few days.
That humble being, who drinks in the Lord's water, never becomes thirsty again. ||2||
Whoever understands, by Guru's Grace, becomes free of hope in the midst of hope.
One comes to see the Lord everywhere, when the soul becomes detached. ||3||
I have tasted the sublime essence of the Lord's Name; the Lord's Name carries everyone across.
Says Kabeer, I have become like gold; doubt is dispelled, and I have crossed over the world-ocean. ||4||3||
Like drops of water in the water of the ocean, and like waves in the stream, I merge in the Lord.
Merging my being into the Absolute Being of God, I have become impartial and transparent, like the air. ||1||
Why should I come into the world again?
Coming and going is by the Hukam of His Command; realizing His Hukam, I shall merge in Him. ||1||Pause||
When the body, formed of the five elements, perishes, then any such doubts shall end.
Giving up the different schools of philosophy, I look upon all equally; I meditate only on the One Name. ||2||
Whatever I am attached to, to that I am attached; such are the deeds I do.
When the Dear Lord grants His Grace, then I am merged in the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||3||
Die while yet alive, and by so dying, be alive; thus you shall not be reborn again.
