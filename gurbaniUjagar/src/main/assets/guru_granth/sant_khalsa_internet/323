Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
Worldly affairs are unprofitable, if the One Lord does not come to mind.
O Nanak, the bodies of those who forget their Master shall burst apart. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
The ghost has been transformed into an angel by the Creator Lord.
God has emancipated all the Sikhs and resolved their affairs.
He has seized the slanderers and thrown them to the ground, and declared them false in His Court.
Nanak's God is glorious and great; He Himself creates and adorns. ||2||
Pauree:
God is unlimited; He has no limit; He is the One who does everything.
The Inaccessible and Unapproachable Lord and Master is the Support of His beings.
Giving His Hand, He nurtures and cherishes; He is the Filler and Fulfiller.
He Himself is Merciful and Forgiving. Chanting the True Name, one is saved.
Whatever pleases You - that alone is good; slave Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary. ||20||
Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
One who belongs to God has no hunger.
O Nanak, everyone who falls at his feet is saved. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
If the beggar begs for the Lord's Name every day, his Lord and Master will grant his request.
O Nanak, the Transcendent Lord is the most generous host; He does not lack anything at all. ||2||
Pauree:
To imbue the mind with the Lord of the Universe is the true food and dress.
To embrace love for the Name of the Lord is to possess horses and elephants.
To meditate on the Lord steadfastly is to rule over kingdoms of property and enjoy all sorts of pleasures.
The minstrel begs at God's Door - he shall never leave that Door.
Nanak has this yearning in his mind and body - he longs continually for God. ||21||1|| Sudh Keechay||
Raag Gauree, The Word Of The Devotees:
One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. By Guru's Grace:
Gauree Gwaarayree, Fourteen Chau-Padas Of Kabeer Jee:
I was on fire, but now I have found the Water of the Lord's Name.
This Water of the Lord's Name has cooled my burning body. ||1||Pause||
To subdue their minds, some go off into the forests;
but that Water is not found without the Lord God. ||1||
That fire has consumed angels and mortal beings,
but the Water of the Lord's Name saves His humble servants from burning. ||2||
In the terrifying world-ocean, there is an ocean of peace.
I continue to drink it in, but this Water is never exhausted. ||3||
Says Kabeer, meditate and vibrate upon the Lord, like the rainbird remembering the water.
The Water of the Lord's Name has quenched my thirst. ||4||1||
Gauree, Kabeer Jee:
O Lord, my thirst for the Water of Your Name will not go away.
The fire of my thirst burns even more brightly in that Water. ||1||Pause||
You are the Ocean of Water, and I am just a fish in that Water.
In that Water, I remain; without that Water, I would perish. ||1||
You are the cage, and I am Your parrot.
So what can the cat of death do to me? ||2||
You are the tree, and I am the bird.
I am so unfortunate - I cannot see the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan! ||3||
You are the True Guru, and I am Your new disciple.
