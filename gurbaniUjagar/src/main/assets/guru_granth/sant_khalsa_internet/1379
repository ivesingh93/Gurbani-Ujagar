Cursed are the lives of those who place their hopes in others. ||21||
Fareed, if I had been there when my friend came, I would have made myself a sacrifice to him.
Now my flesh is burning red on the hot coals. ||22||
Fareed, the farmer plants acacia trees, and wishes for grapes.
He is spinning wool, but he wishes to wear silk. ||23||
Fareed, the path is muddy, and the house of my Beloved is so far away.
If I go out, my blanket will get soaked, but if I remain at home, then my heart will be broken. ||24||
My blanket is soaked, drenched with the downpour of the Lord's Rain.
I am going out to meet my Friend, so that my heart will not be broken. ||25||
Fareed, I was worried that my turban might become dirty.
My thoughtless self did not realize that one day, dust will consume my head as well. ||26||
Fareed: sugar cane, candy, sugar, molasses, honey and buffalo's milk -
all these things are sweet, but they are not equal to You. ||27||
Fareed, my bread is made of wood, and hunger is my appetizer.
Those who eat buttered bread, will suffer in terrible pain. ||28||
Eat dry bread, and drink cold water.
Fareed, if you see someone else's buttered bread, do not envy him for it. ||29||
This night, I did not sleep with my Husband Lord, and now my body is suffering in pain.
Go and ask the deserted bride, how she passes her night. ||30||
She finds no place of rest in her father-in-law's home, and no place in her parents' home either.
Her Husband Lord does not care for her; what sort of a blessed, happy soul-bride is she? ||31||
In her father-in-law's home hereafter, and in her parents' home in this world, she belongs to her Husband Lord. Her Husband is Inaccessible and Unfathomable.
O Nanak, she is the happy soul-bride, who is pleasing to her Carefree Lord. ||32||
Bathing, washing and decorating herself, she comes and sleeps without anxiety.
Fareed, she still smells like asafetida; the fragrance of musk is gone. ||33||
I am not afraid of losing my youth, as long as I do not lose the Love of my Husband Lord.
Fareed, so many youths, without His Love, have dried up and withered away. ||34||
Fareed, anxiety is my bed, pain is my mattress, and the pain of separation is my blanket and quilt.
Behold, this is my life, O my True Lord and Master. ||35||
Many talk of the pain and suffering of separation; O pain, you are the ruler of all.
Fareed, that body, within which love of the Lord does not well up - look upon that body as a cremation ground. ||36||
Fareed, these are poisonous sprouts coated with sugar.
Some dIE planting them, and some are ruined, harvesting and enjoying them. ||37||
Fareed, the hours of the day are lost wandering around, and the hours of the night are lost in sleep.
God will call for your account, and ask you why you came into this world. ||38||
Fareed, you have gone to the Lord's Door. Have you seen the gong there?
This blameless object is being beaten - imagine what is in store for us sinners! ||39||
Each and every hour, it is beaten; it is punished every day.
This beautiful body is like the gong; it passes the night in pain. ||40||
