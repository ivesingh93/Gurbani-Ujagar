Shalok, Third Mehl:
The Order of the Lord is beyond challenge. Clever tricks and arguments will not work against it.
So abandon your self-conceit, and take to His Sanctuary; accept the Order of His Will.
The Gurmukh eliminates self-conceit from within himself; he shall not be punished by the Messenger of Death.
O Nanak, he alone is called a selfless servant, who remains lovingly attuned to the True Lord. ||1||
Third Mehl:
All gifts, light and beauty are Yours.
Excessive cleverness and egotism are mine.
The mortal performs all sorts of rituals in greed and attachment; engrossed in egotism, he shall never escape the cycle of reincarnation.
O Nanak, the Creator Himself inspires all to act. Whatever pleases Him is good. ||2||
Pauree, Fifth Mehl:
Let Truth be your food, and Truth your clothes, and take the Support of the True Name.
The True Guru shall lead you to meet God, the Great Giver.
When perfect destiny is activated, the mortal meditates on the Formless Lord.
Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, you shall cross over the world-ocean.
O Nanak, chant God's Praises, and celebrate His Victory. ||35||
Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
In Your Mercy, You care for all beings and creatures.
You produce corn and water in abundance; You eliminate pain and poverty, and carry all beings across.
The Great Giver listened to my prayer, and the world has been cooled and comforted.
Take me into Your Embrace, and take away all my pain.
Nanak meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; the House of God is fruitful and prosperous. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
Rain is falling from the clouds - it is so beautiful! The Creator Lord issued His Order.
Grain has been produced in abundance; the world is cooled and comforted.
The mind and body are rejuvenated, meditating in remembrance on the Inaccessible and Infinite Lord.
O my True Creator Lord God, please shower Your Mercy on me.
He does whatever He pleases; Nanak is forever a sacrifice to Him. ||2||
Pauree:
The Great Lord is Inaccessible; His glorious greatness is glorious!
Gazing upon Him through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I blossom forth in ecstasy; tranquility comes to my inner being.
All by Himself, He Himself is pervading everywhere, O Siblings of Destiny.
He Himself is the Lord and Master of all. He has subdued all, and all are under the Hukam of His Command.
O Nanak, the Lord does whatever He pleases. Everyone walks in harmony with His Will. ||36||1|| Sudh||
Raag Saarang, The Word Of The Devotees.
Kabeer Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O mortal, why are you so proud of small things?
With a few pounds of grain and a few coins in your pocket, you are totally puffed up with pride. ||1||Pause||
With great pomp and ceremony, you control a hundred villages, with an income of hundreds of thousands of dollars.
The power you exert will last for only a few days, like the green leaves of the forest. ||1||
No one has brought this wealth with him, and no one will take it with him when he goes.
Emperors, even greater than Raawan, passed away in an instant. ||2||
