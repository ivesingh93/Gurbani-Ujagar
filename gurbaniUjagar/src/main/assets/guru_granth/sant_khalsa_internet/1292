Raag Malaar, The Word Of The Devotee Naam Dayv Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Serve the King, the Sovereign Lord of the World. He has no ancestry; He is immaculate and pure.
Please bless me with the gift of devotion, which the humble Saints beg for. ||1||Pause||
His Home is the pavilion seen in all directions; His ornamental heavenly realms fill the seven worlds alike.
In His Home, the virgin Lakshmi dwells. The moon and the sun are His two lamps; the wretched Messenger of Death stages his dramas, and levies taxes on all.
Such is my Sovereign Lord King, the Supreme Lord of all. ||1||
In His House, the four-faced Brahma, the cosmic potter lives. He created the entire universe.
In His House, the insane Shiva, the Guru of the World, lives; he imparts spiritual wisdom to explain the essence of reality.
Sin and virtue are the standard-bearers at His Door; Chitr and Gupt are the recording angels of the conscious and subconscious.
The Righteous Judge of Dharma, the Lord of Destruction, is the door-man.
Such is the Supreme Sovereign Lord of the World. ||2||
In His Home are the heavenly heralds, celestial singers, Rishis and poor minstrels, who sing so sweetly.
All the Shaastras take various forms in His theater, singing beautiful songs.
The wind waves the fly-brush over Him;
His hand-maiden is Maya, who has conquered the world.
The shell of the earth is His fireplace.
Such is the Sovereign Lord of the three worlds. ||3||
In His Home, the celestial turtle is the bed-frame, woven with the strings of the thousand-headed snake.
His flower-girls are the eighteen loads of vegetation; His water-carriers are the nine hundred sixty million clouds.
His sweat is the Ganges River.
The seven seas are His water-pitchers.
The creatures of the world are His household utensils.
Such is the Sovereign Lord King of the three worlds. ||4||
In His home are Arjuna, Dhroo, Prahlaad, Ambreek, Naarad, Nayjaa, the Siddhas and Buddhas, the ninety-two heavenly heralds and celestial singers in their wondrous play.
All the creatures of the world are in His House.
The Lord is diffused in the inner beings of all.
Prays Naam Dayv, seek His Protection.
All the devotees are His banner and insignia. ||5||1||
Malaar:
Please do not forget me; please do not forget me,
please do not forget me, O Lord. ||1||Pause||
The temple pirEsts have doubts about this, and everyone is furious with me.
Calling me low-caste and untouchable, they beat me and drove me out; what should I do now, O Beloved Father Lord? ||1||
If You liberate me after I am dead, no one will know that I am liberated.
These Pandits, these religious scholars, call me low-born; when they say this, they tarnish Your honor as well. ||2||
You are called kind and compassionate; the power of Your Arm is absolutely unrivalled.
The Lord turned the temple around to face Naam Dayv; He turned His back on the Brahmins. ||3||2||
