O Nanak, blessed are the happy soul-brides, who are in love with their Husband Lord. ||4||23||93||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl, Sixth House:
The One Lord is the Doer, the Cause of causes, who has created the creation.
Meditate on the One, O my mind, who is the Support of all. ||1||
Meditate within your mind on the Guru's Feet.
Give up all your clever mental tricks, and lovingly attune yourself to the True Word of the Shabad. ||1||Pause||
Suffering, agony and fear do not cling to one whose heart is filled with the GurMantra.
Trying millions of things, people have grown weary, but without the Guru, none have been saved. ||2||
Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan, the mind is comforted and all sins depart.
I am a sacrifice to those who fall at the Feet of the Guru. ||3||
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the True Name of the Lord comes to dwell in the mind.
Very fortunate are those, O Nanak, whose minds are filled with this love. ||4||24||94||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
Gather in the Wealth of the Lord, worship the True Guru, and give up all your corrupt ways.
Meditate in remembrance on the Lord who created and adorned you, and you shall be saved. ||1||
O mind, chant the Name of the One, the Unique and Infinite Lord.
He gave you the praanaa, the breath of life, and your mind and body. He is the Support of the heart. ||1||Pause||
The world is drunk, engrossed in sexual desire, anger and egotism.
Seek the Sanctuary of the Saints, and fall at their feet; your suffering and darkness shall be removed. ||2||
Practice truth, contentment and kindness; this is the most excellent way of life.
One who is so blessed by the Formless Lord God renounces selfishness, and becomes the dust of all. ||3||
All that is seen is You, Lord, the expansion of the expanse.
Says Nanak, the Guru has removed my doubts; I recognize God in all. ||4||25||95||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
The whole world is engrossed in bad deeds and good deeds.
God's devotee is above both, but those who understand this are very rare. ||1||
Our Lord and Master is all-pervading everywhere.
What should I say, and what should I hear? O my Lord and Master, You are Great, All-powerful and All-knowing. ||1||Pause||
One who is influenced by praise and blame is not God's servant.
One who sees the essence of reality with impartial vision, O Saints, is very rare-one among millions. ||2||
People talk on and on about Him; they consider this to be praise of God.
But rare indeed is the Gurmukh, who is above this mere talk. ||3||
He is not concerned with deliverance or bondage.
Nanak has obtained the gift of the dust of the feet of the Saints. ||4||26||96||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl, Seventh House:
Relying on Your Mercy, Dear Lord, I have indulged in sensual pleasures.
Like a foolish child, I have made mistakes. O Lord, You are my Father and Mother. ||1||
It is easy to speak and talk,
but it is difficult to accept Your Will. ||1||Pause||
I stand tall; You are my Strength. I know that You are mine.
Inside of all, and outside of all, You are our Self-sufficient Father. ||2||
O Father, I do not know-how can I know Your Way?
