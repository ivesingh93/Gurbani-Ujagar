Egotism binds people in bondage, and causes them to wander around lost.
O Nanak, peace is obtained through devotional worship of the Lord. ||8||13||
Gauree, First Mehl:
First, Brahma entered the house of Death.
Brahma entered the lotus, and searched the nether regions, but he did not find the end of it.
He did not accept the Lord's Order - he was deluded by doubt. ||1||
Whoever is created, shall be destroyed by Death.
But I am protected by the Lord; I contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||1||Pause||
All the gods and goddesses are enticed by Maya.
Death cannot be avoided, without serving the Guru.
That Lord is Imperishable, Invisible and Inscrutable. ||2||
The sultans, emperors and kings shall not remain.
Forgetting the Name, they shall endure the pain of death.
My only Support is the Naam, the Name of the Lord; as He keeps me, I survive. ||3||
The leaders and kings shall not remain.
The bankers shall die, after accumulating their wealth and money.
Grant me, O Lord, the wealth of Your Ambrosial Naam. ||4||
The people, rulers, leaders and chiefs -
none of them shall be able to remain in the world.
Death is inevitable; it strikes the heads of the false. ||5||
Only the One Lord, the Truest of the True, is permanent.
He who created and fashioned everything, shall destroy it.
One who becomes Gurmukh and meditates on the Lord is honored. ||6||
The Qazis, Shaykhs and Fakeers in religious robes
call themselves great; but through their egotism, their bodies are suffering in pain.
Death does not spare them, without the Support of the True Guru. ||7||
The trap of Death is hanging over their tongues and eyes.
Death is over their ears, when they hear talk of evil.
Without the Shabad, they are plundered, day and night. ||8||
To those whose hearts are filled with the True Name of the Lord,
and who sing the Glories of God, the death cannot touch.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh is absorbed in the Word of the Shabad. ||9||14||
Gauree, First Mehl:
They speak the Truth - not an iota of falsehood.
The Gurmukhs walk in the Way of the Lord's Command.
They remain unattached, in the Sanctuary of the True Lord. ||1||
They dwell in their true home, and Death does not touch them.
The self-willed manmukhs come and go, in the pain of emotional attachment. ||1||Pause||
So, drink deeply of this Nectar, and speak the Unspoken Speech.
Dwelling in the home of your own being within, you shall find the home of intuitive peace.
One who is imbued with the Lord's sublime essence, is said to experience this peace. ||2||
Following the Guru's Teachings, one becomes perfectly stable, and never wavers.
Following the Guru's Teachings, one intuitively chants the Name of the True Lord.
Drinking in this Ambrosial Nectar, and churning it, the essential reality is discerned. ||3||
Beholding the True Guru, I have received His Teachings.
I have offered my mind and body, after searching deep within my own being.
I have come to realize the value of understanding my own soul. ||4||
The Naam, the Name of the Immaculate Lord, is the most excellent and sublime food.
The pure swan-souls see the True Light of the Infinite Lord.
Wherever I look, I see the One and Only Lord. ||5||
One who remains pure and unblemished and practices only true deeds,
obtains the supreme status, serving at the Guru's Feet.
The mind is reconciliated with the mind, and the ego's wandering ways come to an end. ||6||
In this way, who - who has not been saved?
The Lord's Praises have saved His Saints and devotees.
