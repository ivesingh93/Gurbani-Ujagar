One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:
Shaloks In Addition To The Vaars.
First Mehl:
O you with swollen breasts, let your consciousness become deep and profound.
O mother-in-law, how can I bow? Because of my stiff nipples, I cannot bow.
O sister, those mansions built as high as mountains -
I have seen them come crumbling down. O bride, do not be so proud of your nipples. ||1||
O bride with deer-like eyes, listen to the words of deep and infinite wisdom.
First, examine the merchandise, and then, make the deal.
Proclaim that you will not associate with evil people; celebrate victory with your friends.
This proclamation, to meet with your friends, O bride - give it some thought.
Surrender mind and body to the Lord your Friend; this is the most excellent pleasure.
Do not fall in love with one who is destined to leave.
O Nanak, I am a sacrifice to those who understand this. ||2||
If you wish to swim across the water, then consult those who know how to swim.
Those who have survived these treacherous waves are very wise. ||3||
The storm rages and the rain floods the land; thousands of waves rise and surge.
If you cry out for help from the True Guru, you have nothing to fear - your boat will not sink. ||4||
O Nanak, what has happened to the world?
There is no guide or friend.
There is no love, even among brothers and relatives.
For the sake of the world, people have lost their faith. ||5||
They cry and weep and wail.
They slap their faces and pull their hair out.
But if they chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, they shall be absorbed into it.
O Nanak, I am a sacrifice to them. ||6||
O my mind, do not waver or walk on the crooked path; take the straight and true path.
The terrible tiger is behind you, and the pool of fire is ahead.
My soul is skeptical and doubtful, but I cannot see any other way to go.
O Nanak, as Gurmukh, dwell with your Beloved Lord, and you shall be saved. ||7||
The tiger is killed, and the mind is killed, through the Teachings of the True Guru.
One who understands himself, meets with the Lord, and never dies again.
