As is their awareness, so is their way.
According to the account of our actions, we come and go in reincarnation. ||1||
Why, O soul, do you try such clever tricks?
Taking away and giving back, God does not delay. ||1||Pause||
All beings belong to You; all beings are Yours. O Lord and Master,
how can You become angry with them?
Even if You, O Lord and Master, become angry with them,
still, You are theirs, and they are Yours. ||2||
We are foul-mouthed; we spoil everything with our foul words.
You weigh us in the balance of Your Glance of Grace.
When one's actions are right, the understanding is perfect.
Without good deeds, it becomes more and more deficient. ||3||
Prays Nanak, what is the nature of the spiritual people?
They are self-realized; they understand God.
By Guru's Grace, they contemplate Him;
such spiritual people are honored in His Court. ||4||30||
Siree Raag, First Mehl, Fourth House:
You are the River, All-knowing and All-seeing. I am just a fish-how can I find Your limit?
Wherever I look, You are there. Outside of You, I would burst and die. ||1||
I do not know of the fisherman, and I do not know of the net.
But when the pain comes, then I call upon You. ||1||Pause||
You are present everywhere. I had thought that You were far away.
Whatever I do, I do in Your Presence.
You see all my actions, and yet I deny them.
I have not worked for You, or Your Name. ||2||
Whatever You give me, that is what I eat.
There is no other door-unto which door should I go?
Nanak offers this one prayer:
this body and soul are totally Yours. ||3||
He Himself is near, and He Himself is far away; He Himself is in-between.
He Himself beholds, and He Himself listens. By His Creative Power, He created the world.
Whatever pleases Him, O Nanak-that Command is acceptable. ||4||31||
Siree Raag, First Mehl, Fourth House:
Why should the created beings feel pride in their minds?
The Gift is in the Hands of the Great Giver.
As it pleases Him, He may give, or not give.
What can be done by the order of the created beings? ||1||
He Himself is True; Truth is pleasing to His Will.
The spiritually blind are unripe and imperfect, inferior and worthless. ||1||Pause||
The One who owns the trees of the forest and the plants of the garden -
according to their nature, He gives them all their names.
The Flower and the Fruit of the Lord's Love are obtained by pre-ordained destiny.
As we plant, so we harvest and eat. ||2||
The wall of the body is temporary, as is the soul-mason within it.
The flavor of the intellect is bland and insipid without the Salt.
O Nanak, as He wills, He makes things right.
Without the Name, no one is approved. ||3||32||
Siree Raag, First Mehl, Fifth House:
The Undeceiveable is not deceived by deception. He cannot be wounded by any dagger.
As our Lord and Master keeps us, so do we exist. The soul of this greedy person is tossed this way and that. ||1||
Without the oil, how can the lamp be lit? ||1||Pause||
Let the reading of your prayer book
be the oil and the Fear of God be the wick for the lamp of this body.
Light this lamp with the understanding of Truth. ||2||
Use this oil to light this lamp.
Light it, and meet your Lord and Master. ||1||Pause||
This body is softened with the Word of the Guru's Bani;
you shall find peace, doing seva (selfless service).
