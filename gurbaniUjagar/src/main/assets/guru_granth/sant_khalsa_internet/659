I am joined in true love with You, Lord.
I am joined with You, and I have broken with all others. ||3||
Wherever I go, there I serve You.
There is no other Lord Master than You, O Divine Lord. ||4||
Meditating, vibrating upon You, the noose of death is cut away.
To attain devotional worship, Ravi Daas sings to You, Lord. ||5||5||
The body is a wall of water, supported by the pillars of air; the egg and sperm are the mortar.
The framework is made up of bones, flesh and veins; the poor soul-bird dwells within it. ||1||
O mortal, what is mine, and what is yours?
The soul is like a bird perched upon a tree. ||1||Pause||
You lay the foundation and build the walls.
But in the end, three and a half cubits will be your measured space. ||2||
You make your hair beautiful, and wear a stylish turban on your head.
But in the end, this body shall be reduced to a pile of ashes. ||3||
Your palaces are lofty, and your brides are beautiful.
But without the Lord's Name, you shall lose the game entirely. ||4||
My social status is low, my ancestry is low, and my life is wretched.
I have come to Your Sanctuary, O Luminous Lord, my King; so says Ravi Daas, the shoemaker. ||5||6||
I am a shoemaker, but I do not know how to mend shoes.
People come to me to mend their shoes. ||1||Pause||
I have no awl to stitch them;
I have no knife to patch them. ||1||
Mending, mending, people waste their lives and ruin themselves.
Without wasting my time mending, I have found the Lord. ||2||
Ravi Daas chants the Lord's Name;
he is not concerned with the Messenger of Death. ||3||7||
Raag Sorat'h, The Word Of Devotee Bheekhan Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Tears well up in my eyes, my body has become weak, and my hair has become milky-white.
My throat is tight, and I cannot utter even one word; what can I do now? I am a mere mortal. ||1||
O Lord, my King, Gardener of the world-garden, be my Physician,
and save me, Your Saint. ||1||Pause||
My head aches, my body is burning, and my heart is filled with anguish.
Such is the disease that has struck me; there is no medicine to cure it. ||2||
The Name of the Lord, the ambrosial, immaculate water, is the best medicine in the world.
By Guru's Grace, says servant Bheekhan, I have found the Door of Salvation. ||3||1||
Such is the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the invaluable jewel, the most sublime wealth, which I have found through good deeds.
By various efforts, I have enshrined it within my heart; this jewel cannot be hidden by hiding it. ||1||
The Glorious Praises of the Lord cannot be spoken by speaking.
They are like the sweet candies given to a mute. ||1||Pause||
The tongue speaks, the ears listen, and the mind contemplates the Lord; they find peace and comfort.
Says Bheekhan, my eyes are content; wherever I look, there I see the Lord. ||2||2||
