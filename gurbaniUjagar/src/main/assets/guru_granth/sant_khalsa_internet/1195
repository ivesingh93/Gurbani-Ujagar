It depletes my capital, and the interest charges only increase. ||Pause||
Weaving the seven threads together, they carry on their trade.
They are led on by the karma of their past actions.
The three tax-collectors argue with them.
The traders depart empty-handed. ||2||
Their capital is exhausted, and their trade is ruined.
The caravan is scattered in the ten directions.
Says Kabeer, O mortal, your tasks will be accomplished,
when you merge in the Celestial Lord; let your doubts run away. ||3||6||
Basant Hindol, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The mother is impure, and the father is impure. The fruit they produce is impure.
Impure they come, and impure they go. The unfortunate ones die in impurity. ||1||
Tell me, O Pandit, O religious scholar, which place is uncontaminated?
Where should I sit to eat my meal? ||1||Pause||
The tongue is impure, and its speech is impure. The eyes and ears are totally impure.
The impurity of the sexual organs does not depart; the Brahmin is burnt by the fire. ||2||
The fire is impure, and the water is impure. The place where you sit and cook is impure.
Impure is the ladle which serves the food. Impure is the one who sits down to eat it. ||3||
Impure is the cow dung, and impure is the kitchen square. Impure are the lines that mark it off.
Says Kabeer, they alone are pure, who have obtained pure understanding. ||4||1||7||
Raamaanand Jee, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Where should I go? My home is filled with bliss.
My consciousness does not go out wandering. My mind has become crippled. ||1||Pause||
One day, a desire welled up in my mind.
I ground up sandalwood, along with several fragrant oils.
I went to God's place, and worshipped Him there.
That God showed me the Guru, within my own mind. ||1||
Wherever I go, I find water and stones.
You are totally pervading and permeating in all.
I have searched through all the Vedas and the Puraanas.
I would go there, only if the Lord were not here. ||2||
I am a sacrifice to You, O my True Guru.
You have cut through all my confusion and doubt.
Raamaanand's Lord and Master is the All-pervading Lord God.
The Word of the Guru's Shabad eradicates the karma of millions of past actions. ||3||1||
Basant, The Word Of Naam Dayv Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
If the servant runs away when his master is in trouble,
he will not have a long life, and he brings shame to all his family. ||1||
I shall not abandon devotional worship of You, O Lord, even if the people laugh at me.
The Lord's Lotus Feet abide within my heart. ||1||Pause||
The mortal will even die for the sake of his wealth;
in the same way, the Saints do not forsake the Lord's Name. ||2||
Pilgrimages to the Ganges, the Gaya and the Godawari are merely worldly affairs.
