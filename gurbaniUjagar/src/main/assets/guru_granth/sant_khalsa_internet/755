Raag Soohee, Third Mehl, Tenth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Do not praise the world; it shall simply pass away.
Do not praise other people; they shall dIE and turn to dust. ||1||
Waaho! Waaho! Hail, hail to my Lord and Master.
As Gurmukh, forever praise the One who is forever True, Independent and Carefree. ||1||Pause||
Making worldly friendships, the self-willed manmukhs burn and die.
In the City of Death, they are bound and gagged and beaten; this opportunity shall never come again. ||2||
The lives of the Gurmukhs are fruitful and blessed; they are committed to the True Word of the Shabad.
Their souls are illuminated by the Lord, and they dwell in peace and pleasure. ||3||
Those who forget the Word of the Guru's Shabad are engrossed in the love of duality.
Their hunger and thirst never leave them, and night and day, they wander around burning. ||4||
Those who make friendships with the wicked, and harbor animosity to the Saints,
shall drown with their families, and their entire lineage shall be obliterated. ||5||
It is not good to slander anyone, but the foolish, self-willed manmukhs still do it.
The faces of the slanderers turn black, and they fall into the most horrible hell. ||6||
O mind, as you serve, so do you become, and so are the deeds that you do.
Whatever you yourself plant, that is what you shall have to eat; nothing else can be said about this. ||7||
The speech of the great spiritual beings has a higher purpose.
They are filled to over-flowing with Ambrosial Nectar, and they have absolutely no greed at all. ||8||
The virtuous accumulate virtue, and teach others.
Those who meet with them are so very fortunate; night and day, they chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||9||
He who created the Universe, gives sustenance to it.
The One Lord alone is the Great Giver. He Himself is the True Master. ||10||
That True Lord is always with you; the Gurmukh is blessed with His Glance of Grace.
He Himself shall forgive you, and merge you into Himself; forever cherish and contemplate God. ||11||
The mind is impure; only the True Lord is pure. So how can it merge into Him?
God merges it into Himself, and then it remains merged; through the Word of His Shabad, the ego is burnt away. ||12||
Cursed is the life in this world, of one who forgets her True Husband Lord.
The Lord grants His Mercy, and she does not forget Him, if she contemplates the Guru's Teachings. ||13||
The True Guru unites her, and so she remains united with Him, with the True Lord enshrined within her heart.
And so united, she will not be separated again; she remains in the love and affection of the Guru. ||14||
I praise my Husband Lord, contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Meeting with my Beloved, I have found peace; I am His most beautiful and happy soul-bride. ||15||
The mind of the self-willed manmukh is not softened; his consciousness is totally polluted and stone-hearted.
Even if the venomous snake is fed on milk, it shall still be filled with poison. ||16||
He Himself does - who else should I ask? He Himself is the Forgiving Lord.
Through the Guru's Teachings, filth is washed away, and then, one is embellished with the ornament of Truth. ||17||
