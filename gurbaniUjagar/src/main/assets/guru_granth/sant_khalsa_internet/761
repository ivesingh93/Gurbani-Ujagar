My comings and goings have ended; the Formless Lord now dwells within my mind.
His limits cannot be found; He is lofty and exalted, inaccessible and infinite.
One who forgets His God, shall dIE and be reincarnated, hundreds of thousands of times. ||6||
They alone bear true love for their God, within whose minds He Himself dwells.
So dwell only with those who share their virtues; chant and meditate on God, twenty-four hours a day.
They are attuned to the Love of the Transcendent Lord; all their sorrows and afflictions are dispelled. ||7||
You are the Creator, You are the Cause of causes; You are the One and the many.
You are All-powerful, You are present everywhere; You are the subtle intellect, the clear wisdom.
Nanak chants and meditates forever on the Naam, the Support of the humble devotees. ||8||1||3||
Raag Soohee, Fifth Mehl, Ashtapadees, Tenth House, Kaafee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Even though I have made mistakes, and even though I have been wrong, I am still called Yours, O my Lord and Master.
Those who enshrine love for another, dIE regretting and repenting. ||1||
I shall never leave my Husband Lord's side.
My Beloved Lover is always and forever beautiful. He is my hope and inspiration. ||1||Pause||
You are my Best Friend; You are my relative. I am so proud of You.
And when You dwell within me, I am at peace. I am without honor - You are my honor. ||2||
And when You are pleased with me, O treasure of mercy, then I do not see any other.
Please grant me this blessing, that that I may forever dwell upon You and cherish You within my heart. ||3||
Let my feet walk on Your Path, and let my eyes behold the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.
With my ears, I will listen to Your Sermon, if the Guru becomes merciful to me. ||4||
Hundreds of thousands and millions do not equal even one hair of Yours, O my Beloved.
You are the King of kings; I cannot even describe Your Glorious Praises. ||5||
Your brides are countless; they are all greater than I am.
Please bless me with Your Glance of Grace, even for an instant; please bless me with Your Darshan, that I may revel in Your Love. ||6||
Seeing Him, my mind is comforted and consoled, and my sins and mistakes are far removed.
How could I ever forget Him, O my mother? He is permeating and pervading everywhere. ||7||
In humility, I bowed down in surrender to Him, and He naturally met me.
I have received what was pre-ordained for me, O Nanak, with the help and assistance of the Saints. ||8||1||4||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
The Simritees, the Vedas, the Puraanas and the other holy scriptures proclaim
that without the Naam, everything is false and worthless. ||1||
The infinite treasure of the Naam abides within the minds of the devotees.
Birth and death, attachment and suffering, are erased in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||1||Pause||
Those who indulge in attachment, conflict and egotism shall surely weep and cry.
Those who are separated from the Naam shall never find any peace. ||2||
Crying out, "Mine! Mine!", he is bound in bondage.
Entangled in Maya, he is reincarnated in heaven and hell. ||3||
Searching, searching, searching, I have come to understand the essence of reality.
Without the Naam, there is no peace at all, and the mortal will surely fail. ||4||
