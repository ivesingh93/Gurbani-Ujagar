Meeting with them, love for God is embraced. ||1||
By Guru's Grace, bliss is obtained.
Meditating upon Him in remembrance, the mind is illumined; his state and condition cannot be described. ||1||Pause||
Fasts, religious vows, cleansing baths, and worship to Him;
listening to the Vedas, Puraanas, and Shaastras.
Extremely pure is he, and immaculate is his place,
who meditates upon the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, in the Saadh Sangat. ||2||
That humble being becomes renowned all over the world.
Even sinners are purified, by the dust of his feet.
One who has met the Lord, the Lord our King,
his condition and state cannot be described. ||3||
Twenty-four hours a day, with palms pressed together, I meditate;
I yearn to obtain the Blessed Vision of the Darshan of those Holy Saints.
Merge me, the poor one, with You, O Lord;
Nanak has come to Your Sanctuary. ||4||38||89||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Twenty-four hours a day, he takes his cleansing bath in water;
he makes continual offerings to the Lord; he is a true man of wisdom.
He never leaves anything uselessly.
Again and again, he falls at the Lord's Feet. ||1||
Such is the Saalagraam, the stone idol, which I serve;
such is my worship, flower-offerings and divine adoration as well. ||1||Pause||
His bell resounds to the four corners of the world.
His seat is forever in heaven.
His chauri, his fly-brush, waves over all.
His incense is ever-fragrant. ||2||
He is treasured in each and every heart.
The Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is His Eternal Court.
His Aartee, his lamp-lit worship service, is the Kirtan of His Praises, which brings lasting bliss.
His Greatness is so beautiful, and ever limitless. ||3||
He alone obtains it, who is so pre-ordained;
he takes to the Sanctuary of the Saints' Feet.
I hold in my hands the Saalagraam of the Lord.
Says Nanak, the Guru has given me this Gift. ||4||39||90||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Panch-Pada:
That highway, upon which the water-carrier is plundered -
that way is far removed from the Saints. ||1||
The True Guru has spoken the Truth.
Your Name, O Lord, is the Way to Salvation; the road of the Messenger of Death is far away. ||1||Pause||
That place, where the greedy toll-collector dwells -
that path remains far removed from the Lord's humble servant. ||2||
There, where so very many caravans of men are caught,
the Holy Saints remain with the Supreme Lord. ||3||
Chitra and Gupat, the recording angels of the conscious and the unconscious, write the accounts of all mortal beings,
but they cannot even see the Lord's humble devotees. ||4||
Says Nanak, one whose True Guru is Perfect -
the unblown bugles of ecstasy vibrate for him. ||5||40||91||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Du-Pada 1:
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the Naam is learned;
all desires and tasks are fulfilled.
My thirst has been quenched, and I am satiated with the Lord's Praise.
I live by chanting and meditating upon the Lord, the Sustainer of the earth. ||1||
I have entered the Sanctuary of the Creator, the Cause of all causes.
By Guru's Grace, I have entered the home of celestial bliss. Darkness is dispelled, and the moon of wisdom has risen. ||1||Pause||
