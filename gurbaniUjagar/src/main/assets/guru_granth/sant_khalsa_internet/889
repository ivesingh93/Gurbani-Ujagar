They obtain a permanent seat in the infinite. ||2||
No one falls there, or wavers, or goes anywhere.
By Guru's Grace, some find this mansion.
They are not touched by doubt, fear, attachment or the traps of Maya.
They enter the deepest state of Samaadhi, through the kind mercy of God. ||3||
He has no end or limitation.
He Himself is unmanifest, and He Himself is manifest.
One who enjoys the taste of the Lord, Har, Har, deep within himself,
O Nanak, his wondrous state cannot be described. ||4||9||20||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
Meeting with the Sangat, the Congregation, the Supreme Lord God has come into my consciousness.
In the Sangat, my mind has found contentment.
I touch my forehead to the feet of the Saints.
Countless times, I humbly bow to the Saints. ||1||
This mind is a sacrifice to the Saints;
holding tight to their support, I have found peace, and in their mercy, they have protected me. ||1||Pause||
I wash the feet of the Saints, and drink in that water.
Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Saints' Darshan, I live.
My mind rests its hopes in the Saints.
The Saints are my immaculate wealth. ||2||
The Saints have covered my faults.
By the Grace of the Saints, I am no longer tormented.
The Merciful Lord has blessed me with the Saints' Congregation.
The Compassionate Saints have become my help and support. ||3||
My consciousness, intellect and wisdom have been enlightened.
The Lord is profound, unfathomable, infinite, the treasure of virtue.
He cherishes all beings and creatures.
Nanak is enraptured, seeing the Saints. ||4||10||21||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
Your home, power and wealth will be of no use to you.
Your corrupt worldly entanglements will be of no use to you.
Know that all your dear friends are fake.
Only the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, will go along with you. ||1||
Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord's Name, O friend; remembering the Lord in meditation, your honor shall be saved.
Remembering the Lord in meditation, the Messenger of Death will not touch you. ||1||Pause||
Without the Lord, all pursuits are useless.
Gold, silver and wealth are just dust.
Chanting the Word of the Guru's Shabad, your mind shall be at peace.
Here and hereafter, your face shall be radiant and bright. ||2||
Even the greatest of the great worked and worked until they were exhausted.
None of them ever accomplished the tasks of Maya.
Any humble being who chants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har,
will have all his hopes fulfilled. ||3||
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the anchor and support of the Lord's devotees.
The Saints are victorious in this priceless human life.
Whatever the Lord's Saint does, is approved and accepted.
Slave Nanak is a sacrifice to him. ||4||11||22||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
You gather wealth by exploiting people.
It is of no use to you; it was meant for others.
You practice egotism, and act like a blind man.
In the world hereafter, you shall be tied to the leash of the Messenger of Death. ||1||
Give up your envy of others, you fool!
You only live here for a night, you fool!
You are intoxicated with Maya, but you must soon arise and depart.
You are totally involved in the dream. ||1||Pause||
In his childhood, the child is blind.
In the fullness of youth, he is involved in foul-smelling sins.
