Todee, Fifth Mehl, Fifth House, Du-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Such is the blessing my God has bestowed upon me.
He has totally banished the five evils and the illness of egotism from my body. ||Pause||
Breaking my bonds, and releasing me from vice and corruption, He has enshrined the Word of the Guru's Shabad within my heart.
The Lord has not considered my beauty or ugliness; instead, He has held me with love. I am drenched with His Love. ||1||
I behold my Beloved, now that the curtain has been torn away. My mind is happy, pleased and satisfied.
My house is His; He is my God. Nanak is obedient to His Lord and Master. ||2||1||20||
Todee, Fifth Mehl:
O my mother, my mind is in love.
This is my karma and my Dharma; this is my meditation. The Lord's Name is my immaculate, unstained way of life. ||Pause||
The Support of my breath of life, the wealth of my life, is to gaze upon the Blessed Vision of God's Darshan.
On the road, and on the river, these supplies are always with me. I have made my mind the Lord's companion. ||1||
By the Grace of the Saints, my mind has become immaculate and pure. In His mercy, He has made me His own.
Remembering, remembering Him in meditation, Nanak has found peace. From the very beginning, and throughout the ages, He is the friend of His devotees. ||2||2||21||
Todee, Fifth Mehl:
Dear God, please meet me; You are my breath of life.
Do not let me forget You from my heart, even for an instant; please, bless Your devotee with Your gift of perfection. ||Pause||
Dispel my doubt, and save me, O my Beloved, all-knowing Lord, O Inner-knower, O Searcher of hearts.
The wealth of the Naam is worth millions of kingdoms to me; O God, please bless me with Your Ambrosial Glance of Grace. ||1||
Twenty-four hours a day, I sing Your Glorious Praises. They totally satisfy my ears, O my all-powerful Lord.
I seek Your Sanctuary, O Lord, O Giver of life to the soul; forever and ever, Nanak is a sacrifice to You. ||2||3||22||
Todee, Fifth Mehl:
O God, I am the dust of Your feet.
O merciful to the meek, Beloved mind-enticing Lord, by Your Kind Mercy, please fulfill my yearning. ||Pause||
In the ten directions, Your Praises are permeating and pervading, O Inner-knower, Searcher of hearts, O Lord ever-present.
Those who sing Your Praises, O Creator Lord, those humble beings never dIE or grieve. ||1||
The worldly affairs and entanglements of Maya disappear, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; all sorrows are taken away.
The comforts of wealth and the enjoyments of the soul - O Nanak, without the Lord, know them to be false. ||2||4||23||
Todee, Fifth Mehl:
O my mother, my mind is so thirsty.
I cannot survive, even for an instant, without my Beloved. My mind is filled with the desire to behold the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. ||Pause||
I meditate in remembrance on the Naam, the Name of the immaculate Creator Lord; all the sins and errors of my mind and body are washed away.
The Perfect Supreme Lord God, the eternal, imperishable Giver of peace - spotless and pure are His Praises. ||1||
By the Grace of the Saints, my desires have been fulfilled; in His Mercy, the Lord, the treasure of virtue, has met me.
