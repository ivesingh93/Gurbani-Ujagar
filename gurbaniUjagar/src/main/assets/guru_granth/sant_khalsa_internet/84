Let sincere faith be your bowing in prayer, and let the conquest of your mind be your objective in life.

O Lord, You are inside and outside as well. You are the Knower of secrets.

The one who commits sins lives in fear, while the one who lives righteously rejoices.
O Lord, You Yourself are True, and True is Your Justice. Why should anyone be afraid?

Great is the Greatness of the Lord; He gives His Gifts without being asked. ||6||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Those who act in ego shall all die. Their worldly possessions shall not go along with them.
Because of their love of duality, they suffer in pain. The Messenger of Death is watching all.
