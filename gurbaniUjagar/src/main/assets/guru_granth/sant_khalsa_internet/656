to find the incomprehensible thing.
I have found this incomprehensible thing;
my mind is illuminated and enlightened. ||2||
Says Kabeer, now I know Him;
since I know Him, my mind is pleased and appeased.
My mind is pleased and appeased, and yet, people do not believe it.
They do not believe it, so what can I do? ||3||7||
In his heart there is deception, and yet in his mouth are words of wisdom.
You are false - why are you churning water? ||1||
Why do you bother to wash your body?
Your heart is still full of filth. ||1||Pause||
The gourd may be washed at the sixty-eight sacred shrines,
but even then, its bitterness is not removed. ||2||
Says Kabeer after deep contemplation,
please help me cross over the terrifying world-ocean, O Lord, O Destroyer of ego. ||3||8||
Sorat'h:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Practicing great hypocrisy, he acquires the wealth of others.
Returning home, he squanders it on his wife and children. ||1||
O my mind, do not practice deception, even inadvertently.
In the end, your own soul shall have to answer for its account. ||1||Pause||
Moment by moment, the body is wearing away, and old age is asserting itself.
And then, when you are old, no one shall pour water into your cup. ||2||
Says Kabeer, no one belongs to you.
Why not chant the Lord's Name in your heart, when you are still young? ||3||9||
O Saints, my windy mind has now become peaceful and still.
It seems that I have learned something of the science of Yoga. ||Pause||
The Guru has shown me the hole,
through which the deer carefully enters.
I have now closed off the doors,
and the unstruck celestial sound current resounds. ||1||
The pitcher of my heart-lotus is filled with water;
I have spilled out the water, and set it upright.
Says Kabeer, the Lord's humble servant, this I know.
Now that I know this, my mind is pleased and appeased. ||2||10||
Raag Sorat'h:
I am so hungry, I cannot perform devotional worship service.
Here, Lord, take back Your mala.
I beg for the dust of the feet of the Saints.
I do not owe anyone anything. ||1||
O Lord, how can I be with You?
If You do not give me Yourself, then I shall beg until I get You. ||Pause||
I ask for two kilos of flour,
and half a pound of ghee, and salt.
I ask for a pound of beans,
which I shall eat twice a day. ||2||
I ask for a cot, with four legs,
and a pillow and mattress.
I ask for a quit to cover myself.
Your humble servant shall perform Your devotional worship service with love. ||3||
I have no greed;
Your Name is the only ornament I wish for.
Says Kabeer, my mind is pleased and appeased;
now that my mind is pleased and appeased, I have come to know the Lord. ||4||11||
Raag Sorat'h, The Word Of Devotee Naam Dayv Jee, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
When I see Him, I sing His Praises.
Then I, his humble servant, become patient. ||1||
