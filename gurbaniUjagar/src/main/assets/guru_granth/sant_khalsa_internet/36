He hears and sees everything. How can anyone deny Him?
Those who sin again and again, shall rot and dIE in sin.
God's Glance of Grace does not come to them; those self-willed manmukhs do not obtain understanding.
They alone see the Lord, unto whom He reveals Himself. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs find Him. ||4||23||56||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Without the Guru, the disease is not cured, and the pain of egotism is not removed.
By Guru's Grace, He dwells in the mind, and one remains immersed in His Name.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Lord is found; without the Shabad, people wander, deceived by doubt. ||1||
O mind, dwell in the balanced state of your own inner being.
Praise the Lord's Name, and you shall no longer come and go in reincarnation. ||1||Pause||
The One Lord alone is the Giver, pervading everywhere. There is no other at all.
Praise the Word of the Shabad, and He shall come to dwell in your mind; you shall be blessed with intuitive peace and poise.
Everything is within the Lord's Glance of Grace. As He wishes, He gives. ||2||
In egotism, all must account for their actions. In this accounting, there is no peace.
Acting in evil and corruption, people are immersed in corruption.
Without the Name, they find no place of rest. In the City of Death, they suffer in agony. ||3||
Body and soul all belong to Him; He is the Support of all.
By Guru's Grace, understanding comes, and then the Door of Liberation is found.
O Nanak, sing the Praises of the Naam, the Name of the Lord; He has no end or limitation. ||4||24||57||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Those who have the Support of the True Name are in ecstasy and peace forever.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they obtain the True One, the Destroyer of pain.
Forever and ever, they sing the Glorious Praises of the True One; they love the True Name.
When the Lord Himself grants His Grace, He bestows the treasure of devotion. ||1||
O mind, sing His Glorious Praises, and be in ecstasy forever.
Through the True Word of His Bani, the Lord is obtained, and one remains immersed in the Lord. ||1||Pause||
In true devotion, the mind is dyed in the deep crimson color of the Lord's Love, with intuitive peace and poise.
The mind is fascinated by the Word of the Guru's Shabad, which cannot be described.
The tongue imbued with the True Word of the Shabad drinks in the Amrit with delight, singing His Glorious Praises.
The Gurmukh obtains this love, when the Lord, in His Will, grants His Grace. ||2||
This world is an illusion; people pass their life-nights sleeping.
By the Pleasure of His Will, He lifts some out, and unites them with Himself.
He Himself abides in the mind, and drives out attachment to Maya.
He Himself bestows glorious greatness; He inspires the Gurmukh to understand. ||3||
The One Lord is the Giver of all. He corrects those who make mistakes.
He Himself has deceived some, and attached them to duality.
Through the Guru's Teachings, the Lord is found, and one's light merges into the Light.
Attuned to the Name of the Lord night and day, O Nanak, you shall be absorbed into the Name. ||4||25||58||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
The virtuous obtain Truth; they give up their desires for evil and corruption.
Their minds are imbued with the Word of the Guru's Shabad; the Love of their Beloved is on their tongues.
