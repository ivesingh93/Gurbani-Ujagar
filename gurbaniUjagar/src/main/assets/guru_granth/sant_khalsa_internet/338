So fly away, black crow,
so that I may quickly meet my Beloved Lord. ||1||Pause||
Says Kabeer, to obtain the status of eternal life, worship the Lord with devotion.
The Name of the Lord is my only Support; with my tongue, I chant the Lord's Name. ||2||1||14||65||
Raag Gauree 11:
All around, there are thick bushes of sweet basil, and there in the midst of the forest, the Lord is singing with joy.
Beholding His wondrous beauty, the milk-maid was entranced, and said, "Please don't leave me; please don't come and go!"||1||
My mind is attached to Your Feet, O Archer of the Universe;
he alone meets You, who is blessed by great good fortune. ||1||Pause||
In Brindaaban, where Krishna grazes his cows, he entices and fascinates my mind.
You are my Lord Master, the Archer of the Universe; my name is Kabeer. ||2||2||15||66||
Gauree Poorbee 12:
Many people wear various robes, but what is the use of living in the forest?
What good does it do if a man burns incense before his gods? What good does it do to dip one's body in water? ||1||
O soul, I know that I will have to depart.
You ignorant idiot: understand the Imperishable Lord.
Whatever you see, you will not see that again, but still, you cling to Maya. ||1||Pause||
The spiritual teachers, meditators and the great preachers are all engrossed in these worldly affairs.
Says Kabeer, without the Name of the One Lord, this world is blinded by Maya. ||2||1||16||67||
Gauree 12:
O people, O victims of this Maya, abandon your doubts and dance out in the open.
What sort of a hero is one who is afraid to face the battle? What sort of satee is she who, when her time comes, starts collecting her pots and pans? ||1||
Stop your wavering, O crazy people!
Now that you have taken up the challenge of death, let yourself burn and die, and attain perfection. ||1||Pause||
The world is engrossed in sexual desire, anger and Maya; in this way it is plundered and ruined.
Says Kabeer, do not forsake the Lord, your Sovereign King, the Highest of the High. ||2||2||17||68||
Gauree 13:
Your Command is upon my head, and I no longer question it.
You are the river, and You are the boatman; salvation comes from You. ||1||
O human being, embrace the Lord's meditation,
whether your Lord and Master is angry with you or in love with you. ||1||Pause||
Your Name is my Support, like the flower blossoming in the water.
Says Kabeer, I am the slave of Your home; I live or die as You will. ||2||18||69||
Gauree:
Wandering through 8.4 million incarnations, Krishna's father Nand was totally exhausted.
Because of his devotion, Krishna was incarnated in his home; how great was the good fortune of this poor man! ||1||
You say that Krishna was Nand's son, but whose son was Nand himself?
When there was no earth or ether or the ten directions, where was this Nand then? ||1||Pause||
He does not fall into misfortune, and He does not take birth; His Name is the Immaculate Lord.
