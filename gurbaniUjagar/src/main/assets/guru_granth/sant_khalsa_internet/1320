O my mind, chant and meditate on the Master of the Universe.
Through the Guru's Teachings, meditate on the Lord's Name, and be rid of all the painful past sins. ||1||Pause||
I have only one tongue - I cannot sing His Praises. Please bless me with many, many tongues.
Again and again, each and every instant, with all of them, I would sing His Glorious Praises; but even then, I would not be able to sing all of Your Praises, God. ||1||
I am so deeply in love with God, my Lord and Master; I long to see God's Vision.
You are the Great Giver of all beings and creatures; only You know our inner pain. ||2||
If only someone would show me the Way, the Path of God. Tell me - what could I give him?
I would surrender, offer and dedicate all my body and mind to him; if only someone would unite me in God's Union! ||3||
The Glorious Praises of the Lord are so many and numerous; I can describe only a tiny bit of them.
My intellect is under Your control, God; You are the All-powerful Lord God of servant Nanak. ||4||3||
Kalyaan, Fourth Mehl:
O my mind, chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord, which are said to be inexpressible.
Righteousness and Dharmic faith, success and prosperity, pleasure, the fulfillment of desires and liberation - all follow the humble servant of the Lord like a shadow. ||1||Pause||
That humble servant of the Lord who has such good fortune written on his forehead meditates on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
In that Court, where God calls for the accounts, there, you shall be saved only by meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||
I am stained with the filth of the mistakes of countless lifetimes, the pain and pollution of egotism.
Showering His Mercy, the Guru bathed me in the Water of the Lord, and all my sins and mistakes were taken away. ||2||
God, our Lord and Master, is deep within the hearts of His humble servants. They vibrate the Naam, the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
And when that very last moment comes, then the Naam is our Best Friend and Protector. ||3||
Your humble servants sing Your Praises, O Lord, Har, Har; they chant and meditate on the Lord God, the Master of the Universe.
O God, my Saving Grace, Lord and Master of servant Nanak, please save me, the sinking stone. ||4||4||
Kalyaan, Fourth Mehl:
Only the Lord God knows my innermost thoughts.
If someone slanders the humble servant of the Lord, God does not believe even a tiny bit of what he says. ||1||Pause||
So give up everything else, and serve the Imperishable; The Lord God, our Lord and Master, is the Highest of all.
When you serve the Lord, Death cannot even see you. It comes and falls at the feet of those who know the Lord. ||1||
Those whom my Lord and Master protects - a balanced wisdom comes to their ears.
No one can equal them; their devotional worship is accepted by my God. ||2||
So behold the Wondrous and Amazing Play of the Lord. In an instant, He distinguishes the genuine from the counterfeit.
And that is why His humble servant is in bliss. Those of pure heart meet together, while the evil ones regret and repent. ||3||
Lord, You are the Great Giver, our All-powerful Lord and Master; O Lord, I beg for only one gift from You.
Lord, please bless servant Nanak with Your Grace, that Your Feet may abide forever within my heart. ||4||5||
