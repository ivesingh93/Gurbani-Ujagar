The sweet flavors tempt you, and you are occupied by your false and filthy business. ||2||
Your senses are beguiled by sensual pleasures of sex, by anger, greed and emotional attachment.
The All-powerful Architect of Destiny has ordained that you shall be reincarnated over and over again. ||3||
When the Destroyer of the pains of the poor becomes merciful, then, as Gurmukh, you shall find absolute peace.
Says Nanak, meditate on the Lord, day and night, and all your sickness shall be banished. ||4||
Meditate in this way, O Siblings of Destiny, on the Lord, the Architect of Destiny.
The Destroyer of the pains of the poor has become merciful; He has removed the pains of birth and death. ||1||Second. Pause||4||4||126||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
For a moment of sexual pleasure, you shall suffer in pain for millions of days.
For an instant, you may savor pleasure, but afterwards, you shall regret it, again and again. ||1||
O blind man, meditate on the Lord, the Lord, your King.
Your day is drawing near. ||1||Pause||
You are deceived, beholding with your eyes, the bitter melon and swallow-wort.
But, like the companionship of a poisonous snake, so is the desire for another's spouse. ||2||
For the sake of your enemy, you commit sins, while you neglect the reality of your faith.
Your friendship is with those who abandon you, and you are angry with your friends. ||3||
The entire world is entangled in this way; he alone is saved, who has the Perfect Guru.
Says Nanak, I have crossed over the terrifying world-ocean; my body has become sanctified. ||4||5||127||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl Dupadas:
O Lord, You behold whatever we do in secrecy; the fool may stubbornly deny it.
By his own actions, he is tied down, and in the end, he regrets and repents. ||1||
My God knows, ahead of time, all things.
Deceived by doubt, you may hide your actions, but in the end, you shall have to confess the secrets of your mind. ||1||Pause||
Whatever they are attached to, they remain joined to that. What can any mere mortal do?
Please, forgive me, O Supreme Lord Master. Nanak is forever a sacrifice to You. ||2||6||128||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
He Himself preserves His servants; He causes them to chant His Name.
Wherever the business and affairs of His servants are, there the Lord hurries to be. ||1||
The Lord appears near at hand to His servant.
Whatever the servant asks of his Lord and Master, immediately comes to pass. ||1||Pause||
I am a sacrifice to that servant, who is pleasing to his God.
Hearing of his glory, the mind is rejuvenated; Nanak comes to touch his feet. ||2||7||129||
Aasaa, Eleventh House, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The actor displays himself in many disguises, but he remains just as he is.
The soul wanders through countless incarnations in doubt, but it does not come to dwell in peace. ||1||
