Sorat'h, Third Mehl, First House, Ti-Tukas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
You always preserve the honor of Your devotees, O Dear Lord; You have protected them from the very beginning of time.
You protected Your servant Prahlaad, O Dear Lord, and annihilated Harnaakhash.
The Gurmukhs place their faith in the Dear Lord, but the self-willed manmukhs are deluded by doubt. ||1||
O Dear Lord, this is Your Glory.
You preserve the honor of Your devotees, O Lord Master; Your devotees seek Your Sanctuary. ||Pause||
The Messenger of Death cannot touch Your devotees; death cannot even approach them.
The Name of the Lord alone abides in their minds; through the Naam, the Name of the Lord, they find liberation.
Wealth and all the spiritual powers of the Siddhis fall at the feet of the Lord's devotees; they obtain peace and poise from the Guru. ||2||
The self-willed manmukhs have no faith; they are filled with greed and self-interest.
They are not Gurmukh - they do not understand the Word of the Shabad in their hearts; they do not love the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Their masks of falsehood and hypocrisy shall fall off; the self-willed manmukhs speak with insipid words. ||3||
You are pervading through Your devotees, O Dear God; through Your devotees, You are known.
All the people are enticed by Maya; they are Yours, Lord - You alone are the Architect of Destiny.
