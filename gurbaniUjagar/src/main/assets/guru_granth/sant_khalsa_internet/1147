With Your Support, I survive in the Dark Age of Kali Yuga.
With Your Support, I sing Your Glorious Praises.

In this world and the next, I have Your Support.
The One Lord, our Lord and Master, is all-pervading. ||1||Pause||

The Perfect Lord, our Protector and Savior, is the Ocean of Peace. ||2||
With Your Support, I have no fear.
The True Lord is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.
With Your Support, my mind is filled with Your Power.
Here and there, You are my Court of Appeal. ||3||

All meditate on God, the Treasure of Virtue.

Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
First, I gave up slandering others.
All the anxiety of my mind was dispelled.
Greed and attachment were totally banished.
I see God ever-present, close at hand; I have become a great devotee. ||1||
Such a renunciate is very rare.
Such a humble servant chants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||Pause||
I have forsaken my egotistical intellect.
The love of sexual desire and anger has vanished.
I meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
In the Company of the Holy, I am emancipated. ||2||
Enemy and friend are all the same to me.
The Perfect Lord God is permeating all.
Accepting the Will of God, I have found peace.
The Perfect Guru has implanted the Name of the Lord within me. ||3||
That person, whom the Lord, in His Mercy, saves -
that devotee chants and meditates on the Naam.
That person, whose mind is illumined, and who obtains understanding through the Guru-
says Nanak, he is totally fulfilled. ||4||27||40||
Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
There is no peace in earning lots of money.
There is no peace in watching dances and plays.
There is no peace in conquering lots of countries.
All peace comes from singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||
You shall obtain peace, poise and bliss,
when you find the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, by great good fortune. As Gurmukh, utter the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||Pause||
Mother, father, children and spouse - all place the mortal in bondage.
Religious rituals and actions done in ego place the mortal in bondage.
If the Lord, the Shatterer of bonds, abides in the mind,
then peace is obtained, dwelling in the home of the self deep within. ||2||
Everyone is a beggar; God is the Great Giver.
The Treasure of Virtue is the Infinite, Endless Lord.
That person, unto whom God grants His Mercy -
that humble being chants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||3||
I offer my prayer to my Guru.
O Primal Lord God, Treasure of Virtue, please bless me with Your Grace.
Says Nanak, I have come to Your Sanctuary.
If it pleases You, please protect me, O Lord of the World. ||4||28||41||
Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
Meeting with the Guru, I have forsaken the love of duality.
