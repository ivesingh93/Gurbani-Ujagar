Those who are in love with duality forget You.
The ignorant, self-willed manmukhs are consigned to reincarnation. ||2||
Those who are pleasing to the One Lord are assigned to His service.
Those who are pleasing to the One Lord enshrine Him within their minds.
Through the Guru's Teachings, they are absorbed in the Lord's Name. ||3||
Those who have virtue as their treasure, contemplate spiritual wisdom.
Those who have virtue as their treasure, subdue egotism.
Nanak is a sacrifice to those who are attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||7||27||
Gauree Gwaarayree, Third Mehl:
You are Indescribable; how can I describe You?
Those who subdue their minds, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, are absorbed in You.
Your Glorious Virtues are countless; their value cannot be estimated. ||1||
The Word of His Bani belongs to Him; in Him, it is diffused.
Your Speech cannot be spoken; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, it is chanted. ||1||Pause||
Where the True Guru is - there is the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation.
Where the True Guru is - there, the Glorious Praises of the Lord are intuitively sung.
Where the True Guru is - there egotism is burnt away, through the Word of the Shabad. ||2||
The Gurmukhs serve Him; they obtain a place in the Mansion of His Presence.
The Gurmukhs enshrine the Naam within the mind.
The Gurmukhs worship the Lord, and are absorbed in the Naam. ||3||
The Giver Himself gives His Gifts,
as we enshrine love for the True Guru.
Nanak celebrates those who are attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||8||28||
Gauree Gwaarayree, Third Mehl:
All forms and colors come from the One Lord.
Air, water and fire are all kept together.
The Lord God beholds the many and various colors. ||1||
The One Lord is wondrous and amazing! He is the One, the One and Only.
How rare is that Gurmukh who meditates on the Lord. ||1||Pause||
God is naturally pervading all places.
Sometimes He is hidden, and sometimes He is revealed; thus God has made the world of His making.
He Himself wakes us from sleep. ||2||
No one can estimate His value,
although everyone has tried, over and over again, to describe Him.
Those who merge in the Word of the Guru's Shabad, come to understand the Lord. ||3||
They listen to the Shabad continually; beholding Him, they merge into Him.
They obtain glorious greatness by serving the Guru.
O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Name are absorbed in the Lord's Name. ||4||9||29||
Gauree Gwaarayree, Third Mehl:
The self-willed manmukhs are asleep, in love and attachment to Maya.
The Gurmukhs are awake, contemplating spiritual wisdom and the Glory of God.
Those humble beings who love the Naam, are awake and aware. ||1||
One who is awake to this intuitive wisdom does not fall asleep.
How rare are those humble beings who understand this through the Perfect Guru. ||1||Pause||
The unsaintly blockhead shall never understand.
He babbles on and on, but he is infatuated with Maya.
Blind and ignorant, he shall never be reformed. ||2||
In this age, salvation comes only from the Lord's Name.
How rare are those who contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
They save themselves, and save all their family and ancestors as well. ||3||
