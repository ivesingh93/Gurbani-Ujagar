Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
With my ears, I listen to the Lord, Har, Har; I sing the Praises of my Lord and Master.
I place my hands and my head upon the feet of the Saints, and meditate on the Lord's Name. ||1||
Be kind to me, O Merciful God, and bless me with this wealth and success.
Obtaining the dust of the feet of the Saints, I apply it to my forehead. ||1||Pause||
I am the lowest of the low, absolutely the lowest; I offer my humble prayer.
I wash their feet, and renounce my self-conceit; I merge in the Saints' Congregation. ||2||
With each and every breath, I never forget the Lord; I never go to another.
Obtaining the Fruitful Vision of the Guru's Darshan, I discard my pride and attachment. ||3||
I am embellished with truth, contentment, compassion and Dharmic faith.
My spiritual marriage is fruitful, O Nanak; I am pleasing to my God. ||4||15||45||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
The words of the Holy are eternal and unchanging; this is apparent to everyone.
That humble being, who joins the Saadh Sangat, meets the Sovereign Lord. ||1||
This faith in the Lord of the Universe, and peace, are found by meditating on the Lord.
Everyone is speaking in various ways, but the Guru has brought the Lord into the home of my self. ||1||Pause||
He preserves the honor of those who seek His Sanctuary; there is no doubt about this at all.
In the field of actions and karma, plant the Lord's Name; this opportunity is so difficult to obtain! ||2||
God Himself is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts; He does, and causes everything to be done.
He purifies so many sinners; this is the natural way of our Lord and Master. ||3||
Don't be fooled, O mortal being, by the illusion of Maya.
O Nanak, God saves the honor of those of whom He approves. ||4||16||46||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
He fashioned you from clay, and made your priceless body.
He covers the many faults in your mind, and makes you look immaculate and pure. ||1||
So why do you forget God from your mind? He has done so many good things for you.
One who forsakes God, and blends himself with another, in the end is blended with dust. ||1||Pause||
Meditate, meditate in remembrance with each and every breath - do not delay!
Renounce worldly affairs, and merge yourself into God; forsake false loves. ||2||
He is many, and He is One; He takes part in the many plays. This is as He is, and shall be.
So serve that Supreme Lord God, and accept the Guru's Teachings. ||3||
God is said to be the highest of the high, the greatest of all, our companion.
Please, let Nanak be the slave of the slave of Your slaves. ||4||17||47||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
The Lord of the Universe is my only Support. I have renounced all other hopes.
God is All-powerful, above all; He is the perfect treasure of virtue. ||1||
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the Support of the humble servant who seeks God's Sanctuary.
In their minds, the Saints take the Support of the Transcendent Lord. ||1||Pause||
He Himself preserves, and He Himself gives. He Himself cherishes.
