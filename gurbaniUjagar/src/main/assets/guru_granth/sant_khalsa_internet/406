Please, be kind to me - I am just a worm. This is my object and purpose. ||2||
My body and wealth are Yours; You are my God - nothing is in my power.
As You keep me, so do I live; I eat what You give me. ||3||
The sins of countless incarnations are washed away, by bathing in the dust of the Lord's humble servants.
By loving devotional worship, doubt and fear depart; O Nanak, the Lord is Ever-present. ||4||4||139||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The Blessed Vision of Your Darshan is unapproachable and incomprehensible; he alone obtains it, who has such good destiny recorded upon his forehead.
The Merciful Lord God has bestowed His Mercy, and the True Guru has granted the Lord's Name. ||1||
The Divine Guru is the Saving Grace in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga.
Even those fools and idiots, stained with feces and urine, have all taken to Your service. ||1||Pause||
You Yourself are the Creator, who established the entire world. You are contained in all.
The Righteous Judge of Dharma is wonder-struck, at the sight of everyone falling at the Lord's Feet. ||2||
The Golden Age of Sat Yuga, the Silver Age of Trayta Yuga, and the Brass Age of Dwaapar Yuga are good; but the best is the Dark Age, the Iron Age, of Kali Yuga.
As we act, so are the rewards we receive; no one can take the place of another. ||3||
O Dear Lord, whatever Your devotees ask for, You do. This is Your Way, Your very nature.
With my palms pressed together, O Nanak, I beg for this gift; Lord, please bless Your Saints with Your Vision. ||4||5||140||
Raag Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Thirteenth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O True Guru, by Your Words,
even the worthless have been saved. ||1||Pause||
Even the most argumentative, vicious and indecent people, have been purified in Your company. ||1||
Those who have wandered in reincarnation, and those who have been consigned to hell - even their families have been redeemed. ||2||
Those whom no one knew, and those whom no one respected - even they have become famous and respected at the Court of the Lord. ||3||
What praise, and what greatness should I attribute to You? Nanak is a sacrifice to You, each and every moment. ||4||1||141||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The crazy people are asleep. ||1||Pause||
They are intoxicated with attachment to their families and sensory pleasures; they are held in the grip of falsehood. ||1||
The false desires, and the dream-like delights and pleasures - these, the self-willed manmukhs call true. ||2||
The wealth of the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, is with them, but they do not find even a tiny bit of its mystery. ||3||
By Your Grace, O Lord, You save those, who take to the Sanctuary of the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. ||4||2||142||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Tipadas:
I seek the Love of my Beloved. ||1||Pause||
Gold, jewels, giant pearls and rubies - I have no need for them. ||1||
Imperial power, fortunes, royal command and mansions -
