In the Court of the True Lord, he obtains true glory.
He comes to dwell in the home of his own inner being. ||3||
He cannot be fooled; He is the Truest of the True.
All others are deluded; in duality, they lose their honor.
So serve the True Lord, through the True Bani of His Word.
O Nanak, through the Naam, merge in the True Lord. ||4||9||
Basant, Third Mehl:
Without the grace of good karma, all are deluded by doubt.
In attachment to Maya, they suffer in terrible pain.
The blind, self-willed manmukhs find no place of rest.
They are like maggots in manure, rotting away in manure. ||1||
That humble being who obeys the Hukam of the Lord's Command is accepted.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he is blessed with the insignia and the banner of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Those who have such pre-ordained destiny are imbued with the Naam.
The Name of the Lord is forever pleasing to their minds.
Through the Bani, the Word of the True Guru, eternal peace is found.
Through it, one's light merges into the Light. ||2||
Only the Naam, the Name of the Lord, can save the world.
By Guru's Grace, one comes to love the Naam.
Without the Naam, no one obtains liberation.
Through the Perfect Guru, the Naam is obtained. ||3||
He alone understands, whom the Lord Himself causes to understand.
Serving the True Guru, the Naam is implanted within.
Those humble beings who know the One Lord are approved and accepted.
O Nanak, imbued with the Naam, they go to the Lord's Court with His banner and insignia. ||4||10||
Basant, Third Mehl:
Granting His Grace, the Lord leads the mortal to meet the True Guru.
The Lord Himself comes to abide in his mind.
His intellect becomes steady and stable, and his mind is strengthened forever.
He sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, the Ocean of Virtue. ||1||
Those who forget the Naam, the Name of the Lord - those mortals die eating poison.
Their lives are wasted uselessly, and they continue coming and going in reincarnation. ||1||Pause||
They wear all sorts of religious robes, but their minds are not at peace.
In great egotism, they lose their honor.
But those who realize the Word of the Shabad, are blessed by great good fortune.
They bring their distractible minds back home. ||2||
Within the home of the inner self is the inaccessible and infinite substance.
Those who find it, by following the Guru's Teachings, contemplate the Shabad.
Those who obtain the nine treasures of the Naam within the home of their own inner being,
are forever dyed in the color of the Lord's Love; they are absorbed in the Truth. ||3||
God Himself does everything; no one can do anything at all by himself.
When God so wills, He merges the mortal into Himself.
All are near Him; no one is far away from Him.
O Nanak, the Naam is permeating and pervading everywhere. ||4||11||
Basant, Third Mehl:
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, remember the Lord with love,
and you shall remain satisfied by the sublime essence of the Lord's Name.
The sins of millions upon millions of lifetimes shall be burnt away.
Remaining dead while yet alive, you shall be absorbed in the Lord's Name. ||1||
The Dear Lord Himself knows His own bountiful blessings.
This mind blossoms forth in the Guru's Shabad, chanting the Name of the Lord, the Giver of virtue. ||1||Pause||
No one is liberated by wandering around in saffron-colored robes.
Tranquility is not found by strict self-discipline.
But by following the Guru's Teachings, one is blessed to receive the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
By great good fortune, one finds the Lord. ||2||
In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, glorious greatness comes through the Lord's Name.
