The jewel is concealed, but it is not concealed, even though one may try to conceal it. ||4||
Everything is Yours, O Inner-knower, Searcher of hearts; You are the Lord God of all.
He alone receives the gift, unto whom You give it; O servant Nanak, there is no one else. ||5||9||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl, First House, Ti-Tukas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Who should I ask? Who should I worship? All were created by Him.
Whoever appears to be the greatest of the great, shall ultimately be mixed with the dust.
The Fearless, Formless Lord, the Destroyer of Fear bestows all comforts, and the nine treasures. ||1||
O Dear Lord, Your gifts alone satisfy me.
Why should I praise the poor helpless man? Why should I feel subservient to him? ||Pause||
All things come to one who meditates on the Lord; the Lord satisfies his hunger.
The Lord, the Giver of peace, bestows such wealth, that it can never be exhausted.
I am in ecstasy, absorbed in celestial peace; the True Guru has united me in His Union. ||2||
O mind, chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord; worship the Naam, night and day, and recite the Naam.
Listen to the Teachings of the Holy Saints, and all fear of death will be dispelled.
Those blessed by God's Grace are attached to the Word of the Guru's Bani. ||3||
Who can estimate Your worth, God? You are kind and compassionate to all beings.
Everything which You do, prevails; I am just a poor child - what can I do?
Protect and preserve Your servant Nanak; be kind to him, like a father to his son. ||4||1||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl, First House, Chau-Tukas:
Praise the Guru, and the Lord of the Universe, O Siblings of Destiny; enshrine Him in your mind, body and heart.
Let the True Lord and Master abide in your mind, O Siblings of Destiny; this is the most excellent way of life.
Those bodies, in which the Name of the Lord does not well up, O Siblings of Destiny - those bodies are reduced to ashes.
I am a sacrifice to the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O Siblings of Destiny; they take the Support of the One and Only Lord. ||1||
So worship and adore that True Lord, O Siblings of Destiny; He alone does everything.
The Perfect Guru has taught me, O Siblings of Destiny, that without Him, there is no other at all. ||Pause||
Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, they putrefy and die, O Siblings of Destiny; their numbers cannot be counted.
Without Truth, purity cannot be achieved, O Siblings of Destiny; the Lord is true and unfathomable.
Coming and going do not end, O Siblings of Destiny; pride in worldly valuables is false.
The Gurmukh saves millions of people, O Siblings of Destiny, blessing them with even a particle of the Name. ||2||
I have searched through the Simritees and the Shaastras, O Siblings of Destiny - without the True Guru, doubt does not depart.
They are so tired of performing their many deeds, O Siblings of Destiny, but they fall into bondage again and again.
I have searched in the four directions, O Siblings of Destiny, but without the True Guru, there is no place at all.
