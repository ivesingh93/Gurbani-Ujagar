I live by meditating on Your Feet, God. ||1||Pause||
O my Merciful and Almighty God, O Great Giver,
he alone knows You, whom You so bless. ||2||
Forever and ever, I am a sacrifice to You.
Here and hereafter, I seek Your Protection. ||3||
I am without virtue; I know none of Your Glorious Virtues.
O Nanak, seeing the Holy Saint, my mind is imbued with You. ||4||3||
Wadahans, Fifth Mehl:
God is perfect - He is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.
He blesses us with the gift of the dust of the feet of the Saints. ||1||
Bless me with Your Grace, God, O Merciful to the meek.
I seek Your Protection, O Perfect Lord, Sustainer of the World. ||1||Pause||
He is totally pervading and permeating the water, the land and the sky.
God is near at hand, not far away. ||2||
One whom He blesses with His Grace, meditates on Him.
Twenty-four hours a day, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||3||
He cherishes and sustains all beings and creatures.
Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord's Door. ||4||4||
Wadahans, Fifth Mehl:
You are the Great Giver, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.
God, the Perfect Lord and Master, is permeating and pervading in all. ||1||
The Name of my Beloved God is my only support.
I live by hearing, continually hearing Your Name. ||1||Pause||
I seek Your Sanctuary, O my Perfect True Guru.
My mind is purified by the dust of the Saints. ||2||
I have enshrined His Lotus Feet within my heart.
I am a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. ||3||
Show mercy unto me, that I may sing Your Glorious Praises.
O Nanak, chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, I obtain peace. ||4||5||
Wadahans, Fifth Mehl:
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, drink in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord.
The soul does not die, nor does it ever waste away. ||1||
By great good fortune, one meets the Perfect Guru.
By Guru's Grace, one meditates on God. ||1||Pause||
The Lord is the jewel, the pearl, the gem, the diamond.
Meditating, meditating in remembrance on God, I am in ecstasy. ||2||
Wherever I look, I see the Sanctuary of the Holy.
Singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, my soul becomes immaculately pure. ||3||
Within each and every heart, dwells my Lord and Master.
O Nanak, one obtains the Naam, the Name of the Lord, when God bestows His Mercy. ||4||6||
Wadahans, Fifth Mehl:
Do not forget me, O God, Merciful to the meek.
I seek Your Sanctuary, O Perfect, Compassionate Lord. ||1||Pause||
Wherever You come to mind, that place is blessed.
The moment I forget You, I am stricken with regret. ||1||
All beings are Yours; You are their constant companion.
Please, give me Your hand, and pull me up out of this world-ocean. ||2||
Coming and going are by Your Will.
One whom You save is not afflicted by suffering. ||3||
You are the One and only Lord and Master; there is no other.
Nanak offers this prayer with his palms pressed together. ||4||7||
Wadahans, Fifth Mehl:
When You allow Yourself to be known, then we know You.
We chant Your Name, which You have given to us. ||1||
You are wonderful! Your creative potency is amazing! ||1||Pause||
