Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:
The One Lord alone is our help and support; neither physician nor friend, nor sister nor brother can be this. ||1||
His actions alone come to pass; He washes off the filth of sins. Meditate in remembrance on that Supreme Lord. ||2||
He abides in each and every heart, and dwells in all; His seat and place are eternal. ||3||
He does not come or go, and He is always with us. His actions are perfect. ||4||
He is the Savior and the Protector of His devotees.
The Saints live by meditating on God, the support of the breath of life.
The Almighty Lord and Master is the Cause of causes; Nanak is a sacrifice to Him. ||5||2||32||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Maaroo, Ninth Mehl:
The Name of the Lord is forever the Giver of peace.
Meditating in remembrance on it, Ajaamal was saved, and Ganika the prostitute was emancipated. ||1||Pause||
Dropadi the princess of Panchaala remembered the Lord's Name in the royal court.
The Lord, the embodiment of mercy, removed her suffering; thus His own glory was increased. ||1||
That man, who sings the Praise of the Lord, the treasure of mercy, has the help and support of the Lord.
Says Nanak, I have come to rely on this. I seek the Sanctuary of the Lord. ||2||1||
Maaroo, Ninth Mehl:
What should I do now, O mother?
I have wasted my whole life in sin and corruption; I never remembered the Lord. ||1||Pause||
When Death places the noose around my neck, then I lose all my senses.
Now, in this disaster, other than the Name of the Lord, who will be my help and support? ||1||
That wealth, which he believes to be his own, in an instant, belongs to another.
Says Nanak, this still really bothers my mind - I never sang the Praises of the Lord. ||2||2||
Maaroo, Ninth Mehl:
O my mother, I have not renounced the pride of my mind.
I have wasted my life intoxicated with Maya; I have not focused myself in meditation on the Lord. ||1||Pause||
When Death's club falls on my head, then I will be wakened from my sleep.
But what good will it do to repent at that time? I cannot escape by running away. ||1||
When this anxiety arises in the heart, then, one comes to love the Guru's feet.
My life becomes fruitful, O Nanak, only when I am absorbed in the Praises of God. ||2||3||
Maaroo, Ashtapadees, First Mehl, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Reciting and listening to the Vedas and the Puraanas, countless wise men have grown weary.
So many in their various religious robes have grown weary, wandering to the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage.
The True Lord and Master is immaculate and pure. The mind is satisfied only by the One Lord. ||1||
You are eternal; You do not grow old. All others pass away.
One who lovingly focuses on the Naam, the source of nectar - his pains are taken away. ||1||Pause||
