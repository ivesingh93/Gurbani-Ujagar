The Righteous Judge of Dharma serves them; blessed is the Lord who adorns them. ||2||
One who eliminates mental wickedness from within the mind, and casts out emotional attachment and egotistical pride,
comes to recognize the All-pervading Soul, and is intuitively absorbed into the Naam.
Without the True Guru, the self-willed manmukhs do not find liberation; they wander around like lunatics.
They do not contemplate the Shabad; engrossed in corruption, they utter only empty words. ||3||
He Himself is everything; there is no other at all.
I speak just as He makes me speak, when He Himself makes me speak.
The Word of the Gurmukh is God Himself. Through the Shabad, we merge in Him.
O Nanak, remember the Naam; serving Him, peace is obtained. ||4||30||63||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
The world is polluted with the filth of egotism, suffering in pain. This filth sticks to them because of their love of duality.
This filth of egotism cannot be washed away, even by taking cleansing baths at hundreds of sacred shrines.
Performing all sorts of rituals, people are smeared with twice as much filth.
This filth is not removed by studying. Go ahead, and ask the wise ones. ||1||
O my mind, coming to the Sanctuary of the Guru, you shall become immaculate and pure.
The self-willed manmukhs have grown weary of chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, but their filth cannot be removed. ||1||Pause||
With a polluted mind, devotional service cannot be performed, and the Naam, the Name of the Lord, cannot be obtained.
The filthy, self-willed manmukhs die in filth, and they depart in disgrace.
By Guru's Grace, the Lord comes to abide in the mind, and the filth of egotism is dispelled.
Like a lamp lit in the darkness, the spiritual wisdom of the Guru dispels ignorance. ||2||
I have done this, and I will do that - I am an idiotic fool for saying this!
I have forgotten the Doer of all; I am caught in the love of duality.
There is no pain as great as the pain of Maya; it drives people to wander all around the world, until they become exhausted.
Through the Guru's Teachings, peace is found, with the True Name enshrined in the heart. ||3||
I am a sacrifice to those who meet and merge with the Lord.
This mind is attuned to devotional worship; through the True Word of Gurbani, it finds its own home.
With the mind so imbued, and the tongue imbued as well, sing the Glorious Praises of the True Lord.
O Nanak, never forget the Naam; immerse yourself in the True One. ||4||31||64||
Siree Raag, Fourth Mehl, First House:
Within my mind and body is the intense pain of separation; how can my Beloved come to meet me in my home?
When I see my God, seeing God Himself, my pain is taken away.
I go and ask my friends, "How can I meet and merge with God?" ||1||
O my True Guru, without You I have no other at all.
I am foolish and ignorant; I seek Your Sanctuary. Please be Merciful and unite me with the Lord. ||1||Pause||
The True Guru is the Giver of the Name of the Lord. God Himself causes us to meet Him.
The True Guru understands the Lord God. There is no other as Great as the Guru.
I have come and collapsed in the Guru's Sanctuary. In His Kindness, He has united me with God. ||2||
No one has found Him by stubborn-mindedness. All have grown weary of the effort.
