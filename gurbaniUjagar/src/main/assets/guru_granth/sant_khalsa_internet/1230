Grasping hold of the Feet of the Saints, I have abandoned sexual desire, anger and greed. The Guru, the Lord of the World, has been kind to me, and I have realized my destiny. ||1||
My doubts and attachments have been dispelled, and the blinding bonds of Maya have been broken. My Lord and Master is pervading and permeating everywhere; no one is an enemy.
My Lord and Master is totally satisfied with me; He has rid me of the pains of death and birth. Grasping hold of the Feet of the Saints, Nanak sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||2||3||132||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har; enshrine the Lord, Har, Har, within your mind. ||1||Pause||
Hear Him with your ears, and practice devotional worship - these are good deeds, which make up for past evils.
So seek the Sanctuary of the Holy, and forget all your other habits. ||1||.
Love the Lord's Feet, continually and continuously - the most sacred and sanctified.
Fear is taken away from the servant of the Lord, and the dirty sins and mistakes of the past are burnt away.
Those who speak are liberated, and those who listen are liberated; those who keep the Rehit, the Code of Conduct, are not reincarnated again.
The Lord's Name is the most sublime essence; Nanak contemplates the nature of reality. ||2||4||133||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
I beg for devotion to the Naam, the Name of the Lord; I have forsaken all other activities. ||1||Pause||
Meditate lovingly on the Lord, and sing forever the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe.
I long for the dust of the feet of the Lord's humble servant, O Great Giver, my Lord and Master. ||1||
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the ultimate ecstasy, bliss, happiness, peace and tranquility. The fear is death is dispelled by meditating in remembrance on the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.
Only the Sanctuary of the Feet of the Lord of the Universe can destroy all the suffering of the world.
The Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is the boat, O Nanak, to carry us across to the other side. ||2||5||134||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Gazing upon my Guru, I sing the Praises of my Beloved Lord.
I escape from the five thieves, and I find the One, when I join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||1||Pause||
Nothing of the visible world shall go along with you; abandon your pride and attachment.
Love the One Lord, and join the Saadh Sangat, and you shall be embellished and exalted. ||1||
I have found the Lord, the Treasure of Excellence; all my hopes have been fulfilled.
Nanak's mind is in ecstasy; the Guru has shattered the impregnable fortress. ||2||6||135||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
My mind is neutral and detached;
I seek only the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. ||1||Pause||
Serving the Holy Saints, I meditate on my Beloved within my heart.
Gazing upon the Embodiment of Ecstasy, I rise to the Mansion of His Presence. ||1||
I work for Him; I have forsaken everything else. I seek only His Sanctuary.
O Nanak, my Lord and Master hugs me close in His Embrace; the Guru is pleased and satisfied with me. ||2||7||136||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
This is my condition.
Only my Merciful Lord knows it. ||1||Pause||
I have abandoned my mother and father, and sold my mind to the Saints.
I have lost my social status, birth-right and ancestry; I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||
I have broken away from other people and family; I work only for God.
The Guru has taught me, O Nanak, to serve only the One Lord. ||2||8||137||
