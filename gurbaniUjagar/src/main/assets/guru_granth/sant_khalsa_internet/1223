The Lord is my Best Friend, my Buddy, my Companion. I sing the Glorious Praises of my Sovereign Lord King.
I shall not forget Him in my heart, even for an instant; I have met with the Perfect Guru. ||1||
In His Mercy, He protects His slave; all beings and creatures are in His Power.
One who is lovingly attuned to the One, the Perfect Transcendent Lord God, O Nanak, is rid of all fear. ||2||73||96||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
One who has the Lord's Power on his side
- all his desires are fulfilled, and no pain afflicts him. ||1||Pause||
That humble devotee is a slave of his God, who listens to Him, and so lives.
I have made the effort to gaze upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan; it is obtained only by good karma. ||1||
It is only by Guru's Grace that I see His Vision with my eyes which none can equal.
Please bless Nanak with this Gift, that he may wash the Feet of the Saints, and so live. ||2||74||97||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
I live by singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
Please be Merciful to me, O my Loving Lord of the Universe, that I may never forget You. ||1||Pause||
My mind, body, wealth and all are Yours, O my Lord and Master; there is nowhere else for me at all.
As You keep me, so do I survive; I eat and I wear whatever You give me. ||1||
I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; I shall never again fall into reincarnation.
Slave Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary, Lord; as it pleases Your Will, so do You guide him. ||2||75||98||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
O my mind, the Naam is the most sublime peace.
Other affairs of Maya are corrupt. They are nothing more than dust. ||1||Pause||
The mortal has fallen into the deep dark pit of household attachment; it is a horrible, dark hell.
He wanders in various incarnations, growing weary; he wanders through them again and again. ||1||
O Purifier of sinners, O Lover of Your devotees, please shower Your Mercy on Your meek servant.
With palms pressed together, Nanak begs for this blessing: O Lord, please save me in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||2||76||99||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
The Glorious Radiance of the Lord has spread out everywhere.
The doubts of my mind and body are all erased, and I am rid of the three diseases. ||1||Pause||
My thirst is quenched, and my hopes have all been fulfilled; my sorrows and sufferings are over.
Singing the Glorious Praises of the Unmoving, Eternal, Unchanging Lord God, my mind, body and soul are comforted and encouraged. ||1||
Sexual desire, anger, greed, pride and envy are destroyed in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
He is the Lover of His devotees, the Destroyer of fear; O Nanak, He is our Mother and Father. ||2||77||100||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the world is miserable.
Like a dog, its desires are never satisfied; it clings to the ashes of corruption. ||1||Pause||
Administering the intoxicating drug, God Himself leads the mortals astray; they are reincarnated again and again.
He does not meditate in remembrance on the Lord, even for an instant, and so the Messenger of Death makes him suffer. ||1||
Please be merciful to me, O Destroyer of the pains of the meek and the poor; let me be the dust of the feet of the Saints.
