Raag Aasaa, First Mehl, First House, So Dar ~ That Gate:
What is that Gate, and what is that Home, in which You sit and take care of all?
Countless musical instruments of so many various kinds vibrate there for You; so many are the musicians there for You.
There are so many Ragas there for You, along with their accompanying harmonies; so many minstrels sing to You.
The winds sing to You, as do water and fire; the Righteous Judge of Dharma sings at Your Door.
Chitar and Gupat, the recording angels of the conscious and the subconscious, sing to You; they know, and they write, and on the basis of what they write, the Lord of Dharma passes judgment.
Shiva and Brahma and the Goddess Parvaati, so beautiful and ever adorned by You, sing to You.
The Indras, seated upon their celestial thrones, with the deities at Your Gate, sing to You.
The Siddhas in Samaadhi sing to You, and the Holy Saints, in their contemplative meditation, sing to You.
The celibates, the truthful and the patient beings sing to You, and the mighty warriors sing to You.
The scholarly Pandits sing to You, along with the holy Rishis and the readers of the Vedas throughout the ages.
The Mohinis, the heavenly beauties who entice the heart in paradise, in this world and in the nether regions, sing to You.
The fourteen priceless jewels created by You, and the sixty-eight holy places of pilgrimage, sing to You.
The mighty warriors and the divine heroes sing to You, and the four sources of creation sing to You.
The continents, the worlds and the solar systems, created and installed by Your Hand, sing to You.
They alone sing to You, who are pleasing to Your Will, and who are imbued with the nectar of Your devotional worship.
So many others sing to You, they do not come into my mind; how can Nanak think of them?
That Lord and Master - He is True, forever True; He is True, and True is His Name.
He who created the creation is True, and He shall always be True; He shall not depart, even when the creation departs.
He created the world of Maya with its various colors and species.
Having created the creation, He Himself watches over it, as it pleases His Greatness.
Whatever pleases Him, that is what He does. No one can issue any commands to Him.
He is the King, the King of Kings, the Emperor of Kings! Nanak lives in surrender to His Will. ||1||1||
