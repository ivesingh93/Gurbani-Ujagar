Celebrated and approved is the coming into the world of such a person, who saves all his generations as well.
Hereafter, no one is questioned about social status; excellent and sublime is the practice of the Word of the Shabad.
Other study is false, and other actions are false; such people are in love with poison.
They do not find any peace within themselves; the self-willed manmukhs waste away their lives.
O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Naam are saved; they have infinite love for the Guru. ||2||
Pauree:
He Himself creates the creation, and gazes upon it; He Himself is totally True.
One who does not understand the Hukam, the Command of his Lord and Master, is false.
By the Pleasure of His Will, the True Lord joins the Gurmukh to Himself.
He is the One Lord and Master of all; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, we are blended with Him.
The Gurmukhs praise Him forever; all are beggars of Him.
O Nanak, as He Himself makes us dance, we dance. ||22||1|| Sudh||
Vaar Of Maaroo, Fifth Mehl, Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
If You tell me to, O my Friend, I will cut off my head and give it to You.
My eyes long for You; when will I see Your Vision? ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
I am in love with You; I have seen that other love is false.
Even clothes and food are frightening to me, as long as I do not see my Beloved. ||2||
Fifth Mehl:
I rise early, O my Husband Lord, to behold Your Vision.
Eye make-up, garlands of flowers, and the flavor of betel leaf, are all nothing but dust, without seeing You. ||3||
Pauree:
You are True, O my True Lord and Master; You uphold all that is true.
You created the world, making a place for the Gurmukhs.
By the Will of the Lord, the Vedas came into being; they discriminate between sin and virtue.
You created Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, and the expanse of the three qualities.
Creating the world of the nine regions, O Lord, You have embellished it with beauty.
Creating the beings of various kinds, You infused Your power into them.
No one knows Your limit, O True Creator Lord.
You Yourself know all ways and means; You Yourself save the Gurmukhs. ||1||
Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:
If You are my friend, then don't separate Yourself from me, even for an instant.
My soul is fascinated and enticed by You; when will I see You, O my Love? ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
Burn in the fire, you evil person; O separation, be dead.
O my Husband Lord, please sleep upon my bed, that all my sufferings may be gone. ||2||
Fifth Mehl:
The evil person is engrossed in the love of duality; through the disease of egotism, he suffers separation.
The True Lord King is my friend; meeting with Him, I am so happy. ||3||
Pauree:
You are inaccessible, merciful and infinite; who can estimate Your worth?
You created the entire universe; You are the Master of all the worlds.
No one knows Your creative power, O my all-pervading Lord and Master.
No one can equal You; You are imperishable and eternal, the Savior of the world.
