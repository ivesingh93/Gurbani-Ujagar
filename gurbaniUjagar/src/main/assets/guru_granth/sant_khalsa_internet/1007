O my mind, enshrine the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within your heart.
Love the Lord, and commit your mind and body to Him; forget everything else. ||1||Pause||
Soul, mind, body and breath of life belong to God; eliminate your self-conceit.
Meditate, vibrate on the Lord of the Universe, and all your desires shall be fulfilled; O Nanak, you shall never be defeated. ||2||4||27||
Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:
Renounce your self-conceit, and the fever shall depart; become the dust of the feet of the Holy.
He alone receives Your Name, Lord, whom You bless with Your Mercy. ||1||
O my mind, drink in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Abandon other bland, insipid tastes; become immortal, and live throughout the ages. ||1||Pause||
Savor the essence of the One and only Naam; love the Naam, focus and attune yourself to the Naam.
Nanak has made the One Lord his only friend, companion and relative. ||2||5||28||
Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:
He nourishes and preserves mortals in the womb of the mother, so that the fiery heat does not hurt them.
That Lord and Master protects us here. Understand this in your mind. ||1||
O my mind, take the Support of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Understand the One who created you; the One God is the Cause of causes. ||1||Pause||
Remember the One Lord in your mind, renounce your clever tricks, and give up all your religious robes.
Meditating in remembrance forever on the Lord, Har, Har, O Nanak, countless beings have been saved. ||2||6||29||
Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:
His Name is the Purifier of sinners; He is the Master of the masterless.
In the vast and terrifying world-ocean, he is the raft for those who have such destiny inscribed on their foreheads. ||1||
Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, huge numbers of companions have drowned.
Even if someone does not remember the Lord, the Cause of causes, still, the Lord reaches out with His hand, and saves him. ||1||Pause||
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and take the Path of the Ambrosial Name of the Lord.
Shower me with Your Mercy, O Lord; listening to Your sermon, Nanak lives. ||2||7||30||
Maaroo, Anjulee ~ With Hands Cupped In Prayer, Fifth Mehl, Seventh House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Union and separation are ordained by the Primal Lord God.
The puppet is made from the five elements.
By the Command of the Dear Lord King, the soul came and entered into the body. ||1||
In that place, where the fire rages like an oven,
in that darkness where the body lies face down -
there, one remembers his Lord and Master with each and every breath, and then he is rescued. ||2||
Then, one comes out from within the womb,
and forgetting his Lord and Master, he attaches his consciousness to the world.
He comes and goes, and wanders in reincarnation; he cannot remain anywhere. ||3||
The Merciful Lord Himself emancipates.
He created and established all beings and creatures.
Those who depart after having been victorious in this priceless human life - O Nanak, their coming into the world is approved. ||4||1||31||
