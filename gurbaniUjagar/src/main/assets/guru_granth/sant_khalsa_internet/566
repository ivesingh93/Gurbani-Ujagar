Without pre-ordained destiny, understanding is not attained; talking and babbling, one wastes his life away.
Wherever you go and sit, speak well, and write the Word of the Shabad in your consciousness.
Why bother to wash the body which is polluted by falsehood? ||1||
When I have spoken, I spoke as You made me speak.
The Ambrosial Name of the Lord is pleasing to my mind.
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, seems so sweet to my mind; it has destroyed the dwelling of pain.
Peace came to dwell in my mind, when You gave the Order.
It is Yours to bestow Your Grace, and it is mine to speak this prayer; You created Yourself.
When I have spoken, I spoke as You made me speak. ||2||
The Lord and Master gives them their turn, according to the deeds they have done.
Do not speak ill of others, or get involved in arguments.
Do not get into arguments with the Lord, or you shall ruin yourself.
If you challenge the One, with whom you must abide, you will cry in the end.
Be satisfied with what God gives you; tell your mind not to complain uselessly.
The Lord and Master gives them their turn, according to the deeds they have done. ||3||
He Himself created all, and He blesses then with His Glance of Grace.
No one asks for that which is bitter; everyone asks for sweets.
Let everyone ask for sweets, and behold, it is as the Lord wills.
Giving donations to charity, and performing various religious rituals are not equal to the contemplation of the Naam.
O Nanak, those who are blessed with the Naam have had such good karma pre-ordained.
He Himself created all, and He blesses them with His Glance of Grace. ||4||1||
Wadahans, First Mehl:
Show mercy to me, that I may chant Your Name.
You Yourself created all, and You are pervading among all.
You Yourself are pervading among all, and You link them to their tasks.
Some, You have made kings, while others go about begging.
You have made greed and emotional attachment seem sweet; they are deluded by this delusion.
Be ever merciful to me; only then can I chant Your Name. ||1||
Your Name is True, and ever pleasing to my mind.
My pains are dispelled, and I am permeated with peace.
The angels, the mortals and the silent sages sing of You.
The angels, the mortals and the silent sages sing of You; they are pleasing to Your Mind.
Enticed by Maya, they do not remember the Lord, and they waste away their lives in vain.
Some fools and idiots never think of the Lord; whoever has come, shall have to go.
Your Name is True, and ever pleasing to my mind. ||2||
Beauteous is Your time, O Lord; the Bani of Your Word is Ambrosial Nectar.
Your servants serve You with love; these mortals are attached to Your essence.
Those mortals are attached to Your essence, who are blessed with the Ambrosial Name.
Those who are imbued with Your Name, prosper more and more, day by day.
Some do not practice good deeds, or live righteously; nor do they practice self-restraint. They do not realize the One Lord.
Ever beauteous is Your time, O Lord; the Bani of Your Word is Ambrosial Nectar. ||3||
I am a sacrifice to the True Name.
