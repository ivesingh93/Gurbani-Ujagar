Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
Blessed are those words, by which the Naam is chanted.
Rare are those who know this, by Guru's Grace.
Blessed is that time when one sings and hears the Lord's Name. Blessed and approved is the coming of such a one. ||1||
Those eyes which behold the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan are approved and accepted.
Those hands which write the Praises of the Lord are good.
Those feet which walk in the Lord's Way are beautiful. I am a sacrifice to that Congregation in which the Lord is recognized. ||2||
Listen, O my beloved friends and companions:
in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, you shall be saved in an instant.
Your sins will be cut out; your mind will be immaculate and pure. Your comings and goings shall cease. ||3||
With my palms pressed together, I offer this prayer:
please bless me with Your Mercy, and save this sinking stone.
God has become merciful to Nanak; God is pleasing to Nanak's mind. ||4||22||29||
Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
The Word of Your Bani, Lord, is Ambrosial Nectar.
Hearing it again and again, I am elevated to the supreme heights.
The burning within me has been extinguished, and my mind has been cooled and soothed, by the Blessed Vision of the True Guru. ||1||
Happiness is obtained, and sorrow runs far away,
when the Saints chant the Lord's Name.
The sea, the dry land, and the lakes are filled with the Water of the Lord's Name; no place is left empty. ||2||
The Creator has showered His Kindness;
He cherishes and nurtures all beings and creatures.
He is Merciful, Kind and Compassionate. All are satisfied and fulfilled through Him. ||3||
The woods, the meadows and the three worlds are rendered green.
The Doer of all did this in an instant.
As Gurmukh, Nanak meditates on the One who fulfills the desires of the mind. ||4||23||30||
Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
You are my Father, and You are my Mother.
You are my Relative, and You are my Brother.
You are my Protector everywhere; why should I feel any fear or anxiety? ||1||
By Your Grace, I recognize You.
You are my Shelter, and You are my Honor.
Without You, there is no other; the entire Universe is the Arena of Your Play. ||2||
You have created all beings and creatures.
As it pleases You, You assign tasks to one and all.
All things are Your Doing; we can do nothing ourselves. ||3||
Meditating on the Naam, I have found great peace.
Singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, my mind is cooled and soothed.
Through the Perfect Guru, congratulations are pouring in-Nanak is victorious on the arduous battlefield of life! ||4||24||31||
Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
God is the Breath of Life of my soul, the Support of my mind.
His devotees live by singing the Glorious Praises of the Infinite Lord.
The Ambrosial Name of the Lord is the Treasure of Excellence. Meditating, meditating on the Lord's Name, I have found peace. ||1||
One whose heart's desires lead him from his own home,
