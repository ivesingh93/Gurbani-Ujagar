Those who dIE in the Shabad and subdue their own minds, obtain the door of liberation. ||3||
They erase their sins, and eliminate their anger;
they keep the Guru's Shabad clasped tightly to their hearts.
Those who are attuned to Truth, remain balanced and detached forever. Subduing their egotism, they are united with the Lord. ||4||
Deep within the nucleus of the self is the jewel; we receive it only if the Lord inspires us to receive it.
The mind is bound by the three dispositions-the three modes of Maya.
Reading and reciting, the Pandits, the religious scholars, and the silent sages have grown weary, but they have not found the supreme essence of the fourth state. ||5||
The Lord Himself dyes us in the color of His Love.
Only those who are steeped in the Word of the Guru's Shabad are so imbued with His Love.
Imbued with the most beautiful color of the Lord's Love, they sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, with great pleasure and joy. ||6||
To the Gurmukh, the True Lord is wealth, miraculous spiritual powers and strict self-discipline.
Through the spiritual wisdom of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the Gurmukh is liberated.
The Gurmukh practices Truth, and is absorbed in the Truest of the True. ||7||
The Gurmukh realizes that the Lord alone creates, and having created, He destroys.
To the Gurmukh, the Lord Himself is social class, status and all honor.
O Nanak, the Gurmukhs meditate on the Naam; through the Naam, they merge in the Naam. ||8||12||13||
Maajh, Third Mehl:
Creation and destruction happen through the Word of the Shabad.
Through the Shabad, creation happens again.
The Gurmukh knows that the True Lord is all-pervading. The Gurmukh understands creation and merger. ||1||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who enshrine the Perfect Guru within their minds.
From the Guru comes peace and tranquility; worship Him with devotion, day and night. Chanting His Glorious Praises, merge into the Glorious Lord. ||1||Pause||
The Gurmukh sees the Lord on the earth, and the Gurmukh sees Him in the water.
The Gurmukh sees Him in wind and fire; such is the wonder of His Play.
One who has no Guru, dies over and over again, only to be re-born. One who has no Guru continues coming and going in reincarnation. ||2||
The One Creator has set this play in motion.
In the frame of the human body, He has placed all things.
Those few who are pierced through by the Word of the Shabad, obtain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. He calls them into His Wondrous Palace. ||3||
True is the Banker, and true are His traders.
They purchase Truth, with infinite love for the Guru.
They deal in Truth, and they practice Truth. They earn Truth, and only Truth. ||4||
Without investment capital, how can anyone acquire merchandise?
The self-willed manmukhs have all gone astray.
Without true wealth, everyone goes empty-handed; going empty-handed, they suffer in pain. ||5||
Some deal in Truth, through love of the Guru's Shabad.
They save themselves, and save all their ancestors as well.
Very auspicious is the coming of those who meet their Beloved and find peace. ||6||
Deep within the self is the secret, but the fool looks for it outside.
The blind self-willed manmukhs wander around like demons;
but where the secret is, there, they do not find it. The manmukhs are deluded by doubt. ||7||
He Himself calls us, and bestows the Word of the Shabad.
The soul-bride finds intuitive peace and poise in the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.
O Nanak, she obtains the glorious greatness of the Naam; she hears it again and again, and she meditates on it. ||8||13||14||
Maajh, Third Mehl:
The True Guru has imparted the True Teachings.
