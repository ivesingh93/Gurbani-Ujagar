and sings the Kirtan of His Praises in the Saadh Sangat, O Nanak, shall never see the Messenger of Death. ||34||
Wealth and beauty are not so difficult to obtain. Paradise and royal power are not so difficult to obtain.
Foods and delicacies are not so difficult to obtain. Elegant clothes are not so difficult to obtain.
Children, friends, siblings and relatives are not so difficult to obtain. The pleasures of woman are not so difficult to obtain.
Knowledge and wisdom are not so difficult to obtain. Cleverness and trickery are not so difficult to obtain.
Only the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is difficult to obtain. O Nanak, it is only obtained by God's Grace, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||35||
Wherever I look, I see the Lord, whether in this world, in paradise, or the nether regions of the underworld.
The Lord of the Universe is All-pervading everywhere. O Nanak, no blame or stain sticks to Him. ||36||
Poison is transformed into nectar, and enemies into friends and companions.
Pain is changed into pleasure, and the fearful become fearless.
Those who have no home or place find their place of rest in the Naam, O Nanak, when the Guru, the Lord, becomes Merciful. ||37||
He blesses all with humility; He has blessed me with humility as well. He purifies all, and He has purified me as well.
The Creator of all is the Creator of me as well. O Nanak, no blame or stain sticks to Him. ||38||
The moon-god is not cool and calm, nor is the white sandalwood tree.
The winter season is not cool; O Nanak, only the Holy friends, the Saints, are cool and calm. ||39||
Through the Mantra of the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam, one meditates on the All-pervading Lord.
Those who have the wisdom to look alike upon pleasure and pain, live the immaculate lifestyle, free of vengeance.
They are kind to all beings; they have overpowered the five thieves.
They take the Kirtan of the Lord's Praise as their food; they remain untouched by Maya, like the lotus in the water.
They share the Teachings with friend and enemy alike; they love the devotional worship of God.
They do not listen to slander; renouncing self-conceit, they become the dust of all.
Whoever has these six qualities, O Nanak, is called a Holy friend. ||40||
The goat enjoys eating fruits and roots, but if it lives near a tiger, it is always anxious.
This is the condition of the world, O Nanak; it is afflicted by pleasure and pain. ||41||
Fraud, false accusations, millions of diseases, sins and the filthy residues of evil mistakes;
doubt, emotional attachment, pride, dishonor and intoxication with Maya -
these lead mortals to death and rebirth, wandering lost in hell. In spite of all sorts of efforts, salvation is not found.
Chanting and meditating on the Name of the Lord in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O Nanak, mortals become immaculate and pure.
They continually dwell upon the Glorious Praises of God. ||42||
In the Sanctuary of the Kind-hearted Lord, our Transcendent Lord and Master, we are carried across.
God is the Perfect, All-powerful Cause of causes; He is the Giver of gifts.
He gives hope to the hopeless. He is the Source of all riches.
Nanak meditates in remembrance on the Treasure of Virtue; we are all beggars, begging at His Door. ||43||
The most difficult place becomes easy, and the worst pain turns into pleasure.
Evil words, differences and doubts are obliterated, and even faithless cynics and malicious gossips become good people.
They become steady and stable, whether happy or sad; their fears are taken away, and they are fearless.
