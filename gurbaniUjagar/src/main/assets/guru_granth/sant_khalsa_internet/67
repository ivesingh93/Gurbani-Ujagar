Without the Shabad, the world wanders lost in pain. The self-willed manmukh is consumed.
Through the Shabad, meditate on the Naam; through the Shabad, you shall merge in Truth. ||4||
The Siddhas wander around, deluded by Maya; they are not absorbed in the Samaadhi of the Lord's Sublime Love.
The three worlds are permeated by Maya; they are totally covered by it.
Without the Guru, liberation is not attained, and the double-mindedness of Maya does not go away. ||5||
What is called Maya? What does Maya do?
These beings are bound by pleasure and pain; they do their deeds in egotism.
Without the Shabad, doubt is not dispelled, and egotism is not eliminated from within. ||6||
Without love, there is no devotional worship. Without the Shabad, no one finds acceptance.
Through the Shabad, egotism is conquered and subdued, and the illusion of Maya is dispelled.
The Gurmukh obtains the Treasure of the Naam with intuitive ease. ||7||
Without the Guru, one's virtues do not shine forth; without virtue, there is no devotional worship.
The Lord is the Lover of His devotees; He abides within their minds. They meet that God with intuitive ease.
O Nanak, through the Shabad, praise the Lord. By His Grace, He is obtained. ||8||4||21||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Emotional attachment to Maya is created by my God; He Himself misleads us through illusion and doubt.
The self-willed manmukhs perform their actions, but they do not understand; they waste away their lives in vain.
Gurbani is the Light to illuminate this world; by His Grace, it comes to abide within the mind. ||1||
O mind, chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and find peace.
Praising the Perfect Guru, you shall easily meet with that God. ||1||Pause||
Doubt departs, and fear runs away, when you focus your consciousness on the Lord's Feet.
The Gurmukh practices the Shabad, and the Lord comes to dwell within the mind.
In the mansion of the home within the self, we merge in Truth, and the Messenger of Death cannot devour us. ||2||
Naam Dayv the printer, and Kabeer the weaver, obtained salvation through the Perfect Guru.
Those who know God and recognize His Shabad lose their ego and class consciousness.
Their Banis are sung by the angelic beings, and no one can erase them, O Siblings of Destiny! ||3||
The demon's son Prahlaad had not read about religious rituals or ceremonies, austerity or self-discipline; he did not know the love of duality.
Upon meeting with the True Guru, he became pure; night and day, he chanted the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
He read only of the One and he understood only the One Name; he knew no other at all. ||4||
The followers of the six different life-styles and world-views, the Yogis and the Sanyaasees have gone astray in doubt without the Guru.
If they serve the True Guru, they find the state of salvation; they enshrine the Dear Lord within their minds.
They focus their consciousness on the True Bani, and their comings and goings in reincarnation are over. ||5||
The Pandits, the religious scholars, read and argue and stir up controversies, but without the Guru, they are deluded by doubt.
They wander around the cycle of 8.4 million reincarnations; without the Shabad, they do not attain liberation.
But when they remember the Name, then they attain the state of salvation, when the True Guru unites them in Union. ||6||
In the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, the Name of the Lord wells up, when the True Guru unites us in His Sublime Love.
