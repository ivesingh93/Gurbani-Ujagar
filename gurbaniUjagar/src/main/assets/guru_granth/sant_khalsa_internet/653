O Nanak, they are purified, bathing in the sacred shrine of the Lord. ||26||
Shalok, Fourth Mehl:
Within the Gurmukh is peace and tranquility; his mind and body are absorbed in the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
He contemplates the Naam, he studies the Naam, and he remains lovingly absorbed in the Naam.
He obtains the treasure of the Naam, and his anxiety is dispelled.
Meeting with the Guru, the Naam wells up, and his thirst and hunger are completely relieved.
O Nanak, imbued with the Naam, he gathers in the Naam. ||1||
Fourth Mehl:
One who is cursed by the True Guru, abandons his home, and wanders around aimlessly.
He is jeered at, and his face is blackened in the world hereafter.
He babbles incoherently, and foaming at the mouth, he dies.
What can anyone do? Such is his destiny, according to his past deeds.
Wherever he goes, he is a liar, and by telling lies, he not liked by anyone.
O Siblings of Destiny, behold this, the glorious greatness of our Lord and Master, O Saints; as one behaves, so does he receive.
This shall be God's determination in His True Court; servant Nanak predicts and proclaims this. ||2||
Pauree:
The True Guru has established the village; the Guru has appointed its guards and protectors.
My hopes are fulfilled, and my mind is imbued with the love of the Guru's Feet.
The Guru is infinitely merciful; He has erased all my sins.
The Guru has showered me with His Mercy, and He has made me His own.
Nanak is forever a sacrifice to the Guru, who has countless virtues. ||27||
Shalok, First Mehl:
By His Command, we receive our pre-ordained rewards; so what can we do now, O Pandit?
When His Command is received, then it is decided; all beings move and act accordingly. ||1||
Second Mehl:
The string through the nose is in the hands of the Lord Master; one's own actions drive him on.
Wherever his food is, there he eats it; O Nanak, this is the Truth. ||2||
Pauree:
The Lord Himself puts everything in its proper place.
He Himself created the creation, and He Himself destroys it.
He Himself fashions His creatures, and He Himself nourishes them.
He hugs His slaves close in His embrace, and blesses them with His Glance of Grace.
O Nanak, His devotees are forever in bliss; they have burnt away the love of duality. ||28||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
O mind, meditate on the Dear Lord, with single-minded conscious concentration.
The glorious greatness of the Lord shall last forever and ever; He never regrets what He gives.
I am forever a sacrifice to the Lord; serving Him, peace is obtained.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh remains merged with the Lord; he burns away his ego through the Word of the Shabad. ||1||
Third Mehl:
He Himself enjoins us to serve Him, and He Himself blesses us with forgiveness.
He Himself is the father and mother of all; He Himself cares for us.
O Nanak, those who meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, abide in the home of their inner being; they are honored throughout the ages. ||2||
Pauree:
You are the Creator, all-powerful, able to do anything. Without You, there is no other at all.
