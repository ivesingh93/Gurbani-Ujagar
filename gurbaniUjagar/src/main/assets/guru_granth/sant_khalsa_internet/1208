O my mind, sing forever the Songs of Joy of the Lord of the Universe.
All your disease, sorrow and sin will be erased, if you meditate on the Lord's Name, even for an instant. ||1||Pause||
Abandon all your clever tricks; go and enter the Sanctuary of the Holy.
When the Lord, the Destroyer of the pains of the poor becomes merciful, the Messenger of Death is changed into the Righteous Judge of Dharma. ||1||
Without the One Lord, there is no other at all. No one else can equal Him.
The Lord is Nanak's Mother, Father and Sibling, the Giver of Peace, his Breath of Life. ||2||2||21||

Nanak longs for the dust of their feet; O God, please shower Your Mercy on me! ||2||3||22||

One who enjoys peace in the Company of the Holy, even for an instant, obtains millions of heavenly paradises. ||1||Pause||
This human body, so difficult to obtain, is sanctified by meditating on the Lord. It takes away the fear of death.
Even the sins of terrible sinners are washed away, by cherishing the Lord's Name within the heart. ||1||
Whoever listens to the Immaculate Praises of the Lord - his pains of birth and death are dispelled.
Says Nanak, the Lord is found by great good fortune, and then the mind and body blossom forth. ||2||4||23||
