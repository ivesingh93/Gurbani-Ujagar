Sorat'h, Third Mehl:
Dear Beloved Lord, I praise You continually, as long as there is the breath within my body.
If I were to forget You, for a moment, even for an instant, O Lord Master, it would be like fifty years for me.
I was always such a fool and an idiot, O Siblings of Destiny, but now, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, my mind is enlightened. ||1||
Dear Lord, You Yourself bestow understanding.
Dear Lord, I am forever a sacrifice to You; I am dedicated and devoted to Your Name. ||Pause||
I have died in the Word of the Shabad, and through the Shabad, I am dead while yet alive, O Siblings of Destiny; through the Shabad, I have been liberated.
Through the Shabad, my mind and body have been purified, and the Lord has come to dwell within my mind.
The Guru is the Giver of the Shabad; my mind is imbued with it, and I remain absorbed in the Lord. ||2||
Those who do not know the Shabad are blind and deaf; why did they even bother to come into the world?
They do not obtain the subtle essence of the Lord's elixir; they waste away their lives, and are reincarnated over and over again.
The blind, idiotic, self-willed manmukhs are like maggots in manure, and in manure they rot away. ||3||
The Lord Himself creates us, watches over us, and places us on the Path, O Siblings of Destiny; there is no one other than Him.
No one can erase that which is pre-ordained, O Siblings of Destiny; whatever the Creator wills, comes to pass.
O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides deep within the mind; O Siblings of Destiny, there is no other at all. ||4||4||
Sorat'h, Third Mehl:
The Gurmukhs practice devotional worship, and become pleasing to God; night and day, they chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
You Yourself protect and take care of Your devotees, who are pleasing to Your Mind.
You are the Giver of virtue, realized through the Word of Your Shabad. Uttering Your Glories, we merge with You, O Glorious Lord. ||1||
O my mind, remember always the Dear Lord.
At the very last moment, He alone shall be your best friend; He shall always stand by you. ||Pause||
The gathering of the wicked enemies shall always practice falsehood; they do not contemplate understanding.
Who can obtain fruit from the slander of evil enemies? Remember that Harnaakhash was torn apart by the Lord's claws.
Prahlaad, the Lord's humble servant, constantly sang the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and the Dear Lord saved him. ||2||
The self-willed manmukhs see themselves as being very virtuous; they have absolutely no understanding at all.
They indulge in slander of the humble spiritual people; they waste their lives away, and then they have to depart.
They never think of the Lord's Name, and in the end, they depart, regretting and repenting. ||3||
The Lord makes the lives of His devotees fruitful; He Himself links them to the Guru's service.
Imbued with the Word of the Shabad, and intoxicated with celestial bliss, night and day, they sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
Slave Nanak utters this prayer: O Lord, please, let me fall at their feet. ||4||5||
Sorat'h, Third Mehl:
He alone is a Sikh, a friend, a relative and a sibling, who walks in the Way of the Guru's Will.
One who walks according to his own will, O Siblings of Destiny, suffers separation from the Lord, and shall be punished.
Without the True Guru, peace is never obtained, O Siblings of Destiny; again and again, he regrets and repents. ||1||
The Lord's slaves are happy, O Siblings of Destiny.
