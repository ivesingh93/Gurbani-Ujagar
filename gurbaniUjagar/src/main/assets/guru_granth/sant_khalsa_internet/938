Considering his knowledge, he finds the essence of reality, and lovingly focuses his attention on the Name of the Lord.
The self-willed manmukh sells his knowledge; he earns poison, and eats poison.
The fool does not think of the Word of the Shabad. He has no understanding, no comprehension. ||53||
That Pandit is called Gurmukh, who imparts understanding to his students.
Contemplate the Naam, the Name of the Lord; gather in the Naam, and earn the true profit in this world.
With the true notebook of the true mind, study the most sublime Word of the Shabad.
O Nanak, he alone is learned, and he alone is a wise Pandit, who wears the necklace of the Lord's Name. ||54||1||
Raamkalee, First Mehl, Sidh Gosht ~ Conversations With The Siddhas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The Siddhas formed an assembly; sitting in their Yogic postures, they shouted, "Salute this gathering of Saints".
I offer my salutation to the One who is true, infinite and incomparably beautiful.
I cut off my head, and offer it to Him; I dedicate my body and mind to Him".
O Nanak, meeting with the Saints, Truth is obtained, and one is spontaneously blessed with distinction. ||1||
What is the use of wandering around? Purity comes only through Truth.
Without the True Word of the Shabad, no one finds liberation. ||1||Pause||
Who are you? What is your name? What is your way? What is your goal?
We pray that you will answer us truthfully; we are a sacrifice to the humble Saints.
Where is your seat? Where do you live, boy? Where did you come from, and where are you going?
Tell us, Nanak - the detached Siddhas wait to hear your reply. What is your path?" ||2||
He dwells deep within the nucleus of each and every heart. This is my seat and my home. I walk in harmony with the Will of the True Guru.
I came from the Celestial Lord God; I go wherever He orders me to go. I am Nanak, forever under the Command of His Will.
I sit in the posture of the eternal, imperishable Lord. These are the Teachings I have received from the Guru.
As Gurmukh, I have come to understand and realize myself; I merge in the Truest of the True". ||3||
The world-ocean is treacherous and impassable; how can one cross over?
O Nanak, think it over, and give us your true reply." Charpat the Yogi asks.
What answer can I give to someone, who claims to understand himself?
I speak the Truth; if you have already crossed over, how can I argue with you?" ||4||
The lotus flower floats untouched upon the surface of the water, and the duck swims through the stream;
with one's consciousness focused on the Word of the Shabad, one crosses over the terrifying world-ocean. O Nanak, chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
One who lives alone, as a hermit, enshrining the One Lord in his mind, remaining unaffected by hope in the midst of hope,
sees and inspires others to see the inaccessible, unfathomable Lord. Nanak is his slave". ||5||
Listen, Lord, to our prayer. We seek your true opinion.
Don't be angry with us - please tell us: How can we find the Guru's Door?
This fickle mind sits in its true home, O Nanak, through the Support of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
The Creator Himself unites us in Union, and inspires us to love the Truth". ||6||
Away from stores and highways, we live in the woods, among plants and trees.
For food, we take fruits and roots. This is the spiritual wisdom spoken by the renunciates.
