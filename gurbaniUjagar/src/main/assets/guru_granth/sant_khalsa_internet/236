The One Lord is the Creator of all things, the Cause of causes.
He Himself is wisdom, contemplation and discerning understanding.
He is not far away; He is near at hand, with all.
So praise the True One, O Nanak, with love! ||8||1||

Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Those who implant the Word of the Guru's Shabad within their hearts
cut their connections with the five passions.
They keep the ten organs under their control;
their souls are enlightened. ||1||
They alone acquire such stability,
whom God blesses with His Mercy and Grace. ||1||Pause||
Friend and foe are one and the same to them.
Whatever they speak is wisdom.
Whatever they hear is the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Whatever they see is meditation. ||2||
They awaken in peace and poise; they sleep in peace and poise.
That which is meant to be, automatically happens.
In peace and poise, they remain detached; in peace and poise, they laugh.
In peace and poise, they remain silent; in peace and poise, they chant. ||3||
In peace and poise they eat; in peace and poise they love.
The illusion of duality is easily and totally removed.
They naturally join the Saadh Sangat, the Society of the Holy.
In peace and poise, they meet and merge with the Supreme Lord God. ||4||
They are at peace in their homes, and they are at peace while detached.
