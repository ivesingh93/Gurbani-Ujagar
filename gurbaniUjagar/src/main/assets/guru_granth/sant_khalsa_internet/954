The Paandavas were made slaves, and wept,
but they once lived in the Presence of the Lord.
Janmayjaa wept, that he had lost his way.
One mistake, and he became a sinner.
The Shaykhs, Pirs and spiritual teachers weep;
at the very last instant, they suffer in agony.
The kings weep - their ears are cut;
they go begging from house to house.
The miser weeps; he has to leave behind the wealth he has gathered.
The Pandit, the religious scholar, weeps when his learning is gone.

O Nanak, the whole world is suffering.
He alone is victorious, who believes in the Lord's Name.
No other action is of any account. ||1||
Second Mehl:
Meditation, austerity and everything come through belief in the Lord's Name. All other actions are useless.
O Nanak, believe in the One who is worth believing in. By Guru's Grace, he is realized. ||2||
Pauree:
The union of the body and the soul-swan was pre-ordained by the Creator Lord.
He is hidden, and yet pervading all. He is revealed to the Gurmukh.
Singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and chanting His Praises, one merges in His Glories.
True is the True Word of the Guru's Bani. One unites in Union with the True Lord.
He Himself is everything; He Himself grants glorious greatness. ||14||

The Jeweler has come, and opened up the bag of jewels.
The merchandise and the merchant are merged together.

The fortress of the body has nine gates; the tenth gate is kept hidden.

Deep within the nucleus of the heart, the Divine Light shines forth. Through devotional worship, one meets the Lord.
The One Lord is pervading and permeating all. He Himself created the creation. ||15||
Shalok, Second Mehl:
He is truly blind, who follows the way shown by the blind man.
O Nanak, why should the one who can see, get lost?
Do not call them blind, who have no eyes in their face.
They alone are blind, O Nanak, who wander away from their Lord and Master. ||1||
Second Mehl:
One whom the Lord has made blind - the Lord can make him see again.
He acts only as he knows, although he may be spoken to a hundred times.
Where the real thing is not seen, self-conceit prevails there - know this well.
O Nanak, how can the purchaser purchase the real thing, if he cannot recognize it? ||2||
Second Mehl:
How can someone be called blind, if he was made blind by the Lord's Command?
O Nanak, one who does not understand the Hukam of the Lord's Command should be called blind. ||3||
