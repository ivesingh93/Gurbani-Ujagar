Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
Honor the One, to whom everything belongs.
Leave your egotistical pride behind.
You belong to Him; everyone belongs to Him.
Worship and adore Him, and you shall be at peace forever. ||1||
Why do you wander in doubt, you fool?
Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, nothing is of any use at all. Crying out, 'Mine, mine', a great many have departed, regretfully repenting. ||1||Pause||
Whatever the Lord has done, accept that as good.
Without accepting, you shall mingle with dust.
His Will seems sweet to me.
By Guru's Grace, He comes to dwell in the mind. ||2||
He Himself is carefree and independent, imperceptible.
Twenty-four hours a day, O mind, meditate on Him.
When He comes into the consciousness, pain is dispelled.
Here and hereafter, your face shall be radiant and bright. ||3||
Who, and how many have been saved, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord?
They cannot be counted or evaluated.
Even the sinking iron is saved, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy,
O Nanak, as His Grace is received. ||4||31||42||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
In your mind, meditate on the Lord God.
This is the Teaching given by the Perfect Guru.
All fears and terrors are taken away,
and your hopes shall be fulfilled. ||1||
Service to the Divine Guru is fruitful and rewarding.
His value cannot be described; the True Lord is unseen and mysterious. ||1||Pause||
He Himself is the Doer, the Cause of causes.
Meditate on Him forever, O my mind,
and continually serve Him.
You shall be blessed with truth, intuition and peace, O my friend. ||2||
My Lord and Master is so very great.
In an instant, He establishes and disestablishes.
There is no other than Him.
He is the Saving Grace of His humble servant. ||3||
Please take pity on me, and hear my prayer,
that Your servant may behold the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.
Nanak chants the Chant of the Lord,
whose glory and radiance are the highest of all. ||4||32||43||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
Reliance on mortal man is useless.
O God, my Lord and Master, You are my only Support.
I have discarded all other hopes.
I have met with my carefree Lord and Master, the treasure of virtue. ||1||
Meditate on the Name of the Lord alone, O my mind.
Your affairs shall be perfectly resolved; sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, Har, Har, Har, O my mind. ||1||Pause||
You are the Doer, the Cause of causes.
Your lotus feet, Lord, are my Sanctuary.
I meditate on the Lord in my mind and body.
The blissful Lord has revealed His form to me. ||2||
I seek His eternal support;
He is the Creator of all beings.
Remembering the Lord in meditation, the treasure is obtained.
At the very last instant, He shall be your Savior. ||3||
Be the dust of all men's feet.
Eradicate self-conceit, and merge in the Lord.
Night and day, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
O Nanak, this is the most rewarding activity. ||4||33||44||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
He is the Doer, the Cause of causes, the bountiful Lord.
The merciful Lord cherishes all.
The Lord is unseen and infinite.
God is great and endless. ||1||
