Raag Malaar, Chau-Padas, First Mehl, First House:
One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:
Eating, drinking, laughing and sleeping, the mortal forgets about dying.
Forgetting his Lord and Master, the mortal is ruined, and his life is cursed. He cannot remain forever. ||1||
O mortal, meditate on the One Lord.
You shall go to your true home with honor. ||1 Pause||
Those who serve You - what can they give You? They beg for and receive what cannot remain.
You are the Great Giver of all souls; You are the Life within all living beings. ||2||
The Gurmukhs meditate, and receive the Ambrosial Nectar; thus they become pure.
Day and night, chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, O mortal. It makes the filthy immaculate. ||3||
As is the season, so is the comfort of the body, and so is the body itself.
O Nanak, that season is beautiful; without the Name, what season is it? ||4||1||
Malaar, First Mehl:
I offer prayers to my Beloved Guru, that He may unite me with my Husband Lord.
I hear the thunder in the clouds, and my mind is cooled and soothed; imbued with the Love of my Dear Beloved, I sing His Glorious Praises. ||1||
The rain pours down, and my mind is drenched with His Love.
The drop of Ambrosial Nectar pleases my heart; the Guru has fascinated my mind, which is drenched in the sublime essence of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
With intuitive peace and poise, the soul-bride is loved by her Husband Lord; her mind is pleased and appeased by the Guru's Teachings.
She is the happy soul-bride of her Husband Lord; her mind and body are filled with joy by His Love. ||2||
Discarding her demerits, she becomes detached; with the Lord as her Husband, her marriage is eternal.
She never suffers separation or sorrow; her Lord God showers her with His Grace. ||3||
Her mind is steady and stable; she does not come and go in reincarnation.
She takes the Shelter of the Perfect Guru. O Nanak, as Gurmukh, chant the Naam; you shall be accepted as the true soul-bride of the Lord. ||4||2||
Malaar, First Mehl:
They pretend to understand the Truth, but they are not satisfied by the Naam; they waste their lives in egotism.
