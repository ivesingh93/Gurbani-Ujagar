I have sought the Sanctuary of the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; my mind longs for the dust of their Feet. ||1||
I do not know the way, and I have no virtue. It is so difficult to escape from Maya!
Nanak has come and fallen at the Guru's feet; all of his evil inclinations have vanished. ||2||2||28||
Dayv-Gandhaaree, Fifth Mehl:
O Beloved, Your Words are Ambrosial Nectar.
O supremely beautiful Enticer, O Beloved, You are among all, and yet distinct from all. ||1||Pause||
I do not seek power, and I do not seek liberation. My mind is in love with Your Lotus Feet.
Brahma, Shiva, the Siddhas, the silent sages and Indra - I seek only the Blessed Vision of my Lord and Master's Darshan. ||1||
I have come, helpless, to Your Door, O Lord Master; I am exhausted - I seek the Sanctuary of the Saints.
Says Nanak, I have met my Enticing Lord God; my mind is cooled and soothed - it blossoms forth in joy. ||2||3||29||
Dayv-Gandhaaree, Fifth Mehl:
Meditating on the Lord, His servant swims across to salvation.
When God becomes merciful to the meek, then one does not have to suffer reincarnation, only to die again. ||1||Pause||
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and he does not lose the jewel of this human life.
Singing the Glories of God, he crosses over the ocean of poison, and saves all his generations as well. ||1||
The Lotus Feet of the Lord abide within his heart, and with every breath and morsel of food, he chants the Lord's Name.
Nanak has grasped the Support of the Lord of the Universe; again and again, he is a sacrifice to Him. ||2||4||30||
Raag Dayv-Gandhaaree, Fifth Mehl, Fourth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Some wander around the forests, wearing religious robes, but the Fascinating Lord remains distant from them. ||1||Pause||
They talk, preach, and sing their lovely songs, but within their minds, the filth of their sins remains. ||1||
They may be very beautiful, extremely clever, wise and educated, and they may speak very sweetly. ||2||
To forsake pride, emotional attachment, and the sense of 'mine and yours', is the path of the double-edged sword. ||3||
Says Nanak, they alone swim across the terrifying world-ocean, who, by God's Grace, join the Society of the Saints. ||4||1||31||
Raag Dayv-Gandhaaree, Fifth Mehl, Fifth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
I have seen the Lord to be on high; the Fascinating Lord is the highest of all.
No one else is equal to Him - I have made the most extensive search on this. ||1||Pause||
Utterly infinite, exceedingly great, deep and unfathomable - He is lofty, beyond reach.
His weight cannot be weighed, His value cannot be estimated. How can the Enticer of the mind be obtained? ||1||
Millions search for Him, on various paths, but without the Guru, none find Him.
Says Nanak, the Lord Master has become Merciful. Meeting the Holy Saint, I drink in the sublime essence. ||2||1||32||
