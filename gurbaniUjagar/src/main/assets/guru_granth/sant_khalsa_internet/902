At the very last moment, Ajaamal became aware of the Lord;
that state which even the supreme Yogis desire - he attained that state in an instant. ||2||
The elephant had no virtue and no knowledge; what religious rituals has he performed?
O Nanak, behold the way of the Lord, who bestowed the gift of fearlessness. ||3||1||
Raamkalee, Ninth Mehl:
Holy people: what way should I now adopt,
by which all evil-mindedness may be dispelled, and the mind may vibrate in devotional worship to the Lord? ||1||Pause||
My mind is entangled in Maya; it knows nothing at all of spiritual wisdom.
What is that Name, by which the world, contemplating it, might attain the state of Nirvaanaa? ||1||
When the Saints became kind and compassionate, they told me this.
Understand, that whoever sings the Kirtan of God's Praises, has performed all religious rituals. ||2||
One who enshrines the Lord's Name in his heart night and day - even for an instant -
has his fear of Death eradicated. O Nanak, his life is approved and fulfilled. ||3||2||
Raamkalee, Ninth Mehl:
O mortal, focus your thoughts on the Lord.
Moment by moment, your life is running out; night and day, your body is passing away in vain. ||1||Pause||
You have wasted your youth in corrupt pleasures, and your childhood in ignorance.
You have grown old, and even now, you do not understand, the evil-mindedness in which you are entangled. ||1||
Why have you forgotten your Lord and Master, who blessed you with this human life?
Remembering Him in meditation, one is liberated. And yet, you do not sing His Praises, even for an instant. ||2||
Why are you intoxicated with Maya? It will not go along with you.
Says Nanak, think of Him, remember Him in your mind. He is the Fulfiller of desires, who will be your help and support in the end. ||3||3||81||
Raamkalee, First Mehl, Ashtapadees:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The same moon rises, and the same stars; the same sun shines in the sky.
The earth is the same, and the same wind blows. The age in which we dwell affects living beings, but not these places. ||1||
Give up your attachment to life.
Those who act like tyrants are accepted and approved - recognize that this is the sign of the Dark Age of Kali Yuga. ||1||Pause||
Kali Yuga has not been heard to have come to any country, or to be sitting at any sacred shrine.
It is not where the generous person gives to charities, nor seated in the mansion he has built. ||2||
If someone practices Truth, he is frustrated; prosperity does not come to the home of the sincere.
If someone chants the Lord's Name, he is scorned. These are the signs of Kali Yuga. ||3||
Whoever is in charge, is humiliated. Why should the servant be afraid,
when the master is put in chains? He dies at the hands of his servant. ||4||
