Thereafter, one does not die, and does not come and go in reincarnation.
The Lord's slave is in the Lord, and the Lord is in His slave.
Wherever I look, I see none other than the Lord. ||1||
The Gurmukhs worship the Lord, and find His celestial home.

So make Him your Guru, who implants the Truth within you,
who leads you to speak the Unspoken Speech, and who merges you in the Word of the Shabad.
