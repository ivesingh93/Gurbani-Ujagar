Sing the Praises of the Lord and Master, with the love of your soul.
Those who seek His Sanctuary, and meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are blended with the Lord in celestial peace. ||1||Pause||
The feet of the Lord's humble servant abide in my heart; with them, my body is made pure.
O treasure of mercy, please bless Nanak with the dust of the feet of Your humble servants; this alone brings peace. ||2||4||35||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
People try to deceive others, but the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, knows everything.
They commit sins, and then deny them, while they pretend to be in Nirvaanaa. ||1||
They believe that You are far away, but You, O God, are near at hand.
Looking around, this way and that, the greedy people come and go. ||Pause||
As long as the doubts of the mind are not removed, liberation is not found.
Says Nanak, he alone is a Saint, a devotee, and a humble servant of the Lord, to whom the Lord and Master is merciful. ||2||5||36||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
My Guru gives the Naam, the Name of the Lord, to those who have such karma written on their foreheads.
He implants the Naam, and inspires us to chant the Naam; this is Dharma, true religion, in this world. ||1||
The Naam is the glory and greatness of the Lord's humble servant.
The Naam is his salvation, and the Naam is his honor; he accepts whatever comes to pass. ||1||Pause||
That humble servant, who has the Naam as his wealth, is the perfect banker.
The Naam is his occupation, O Nanak, and his only support; the Naam is the profit he earns. ||2||6||37||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
My eyes have been purified, gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, and touching my forehead to the dust of His feet.
With joy and happiness, I sing the Glorious Praises of my Lord and Master; the Lord of the World abides within my heart. ||1||
You are my Merciful Protector, Lord.
O beautiful, wise, infinite Father God, be Merciful to me, God. ||1||Pause||
O Lord of supreme ecstasy and blissful form, Your Word is so beautiful, so drenched with Nectar.
With the Lord's lotus feet enshrined in his heart, Nanak has tied the Shabad, the Word of the True Guru, to the hem of his robe. ||2||7||38||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
In His own way, He provides us with our food; in His own way, He plays with us.
He blesses us with all comforts, enjoyments and delicacies, and he permeates our minds. ||1||
Our Father is the Lord of the World, the Merciful Lord.
Just as the mother protects her children, God nurtures and cares for us. ||1||Pause||
You are my friend and companion, the Master of all excellences, O eternal and permanent Divine Lord.
Here, there and everywhere, You are pervading; please, bless Nanak to serve the Saints. ||2||8||39||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
The Saints are kind and compassionate; they burn away their sexual desire, anger and corruption.
My power, wealth, youth, body and soul are a sacrifice to them. ||1||
With my mind and body, I love the Lord's Name.
With peace, poise, pleasure and joy, He has carried me across the terrifying world-ocean. ||Pause||
