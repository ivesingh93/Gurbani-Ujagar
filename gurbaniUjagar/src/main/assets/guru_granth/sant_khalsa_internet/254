Shalok:
See, that even by calculating and scheming in their minds, people must surely depart in the end.
Hopes and desires for transitory things are erased for the Gurmukh; O Nanak, the Name alone brings true health. ||1||
Pauree:
GAGGA: Chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe with each and every breath; meditate on Him forever.
How can you rely on the body? Do not delay, my friend;
there is nothing to stand in Death's way - neither in childhood, nor in youth, nor in old age.
That time is not known, when the noose of Death shall come and fall on you.
See, that even spiritual scholars, those who meditate, and those who are clever shall not stay in this place.
Only the fool clings to that, which everyone else has abandoned and left behind.
By Guru's Grace, one who has such good destiny written on his forehead remembers the Lord in meditation.
O Nanak, blessed and fruitful is the coming of those who obtain the Beloved Lord as their Husband. ||19||
Shalok:
I have searched all the Shaastras and the Vedas, and they say nothing except this:
In the beginning, throughout the ages, now and forevermore, O Nanak, the One Lord alone exists. ||1||
Pauree:
GHAGHA: Put this into your mind, that there is no one except the Lord.
There never was, and there never shall be. He is pervading everywhere.
You shall be absorbed into Him, O mind, if you come to His Sanctuary.
In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, only the Naam, the Name of the Lord, shall be of any real use to you.
So many work and slave continually, but they come to regret and repent in the end.
Without devotional worship of the Lord, how can they find stability?
They alone taste the supreme essence, and drink in the Ambrosial Nectar,
O Nanak, unto whom the Lord, the Guru, gives it. ||20||
Shalok:
He has counted all the days and the breaths, and placed them in people's destiny; they do not increase or decrease one little bit.
Those who long to live in doubt and emotional attachment, O Nanak, are total fools. ||1||
Pauree:
NGANGA: Death seizes those whom God has made into faithless cynics.
They are born and they die, enduring countless incarnations; they do not realize the Lord, the Supreme Soul.
They alone find spiritual wisdom and meditation,
whom the Lord blesses with His Mercy;
no one is emancipated by counting and calculating.
The vessel of clay shall surely break.
They alone live, who, while alive, meditate on the Lord.
They are respected, O Nanak, and do not remain hidden. ||21||
Shalok:
Focus your consciousness on His Lotus Feet, and the inverted lotus of your heart shall blossom forth.
The Lord of the Universe Himself becomes manifest, O Nanak, through the Teachings of the Saints. ||1||
Pauree:
CHACHA: When I became attached to the Lord's Lotus Feet,
blessed, blessed is that day.
After wandering around in the four quarters and the ten directions,
God showed His Mercy to me, and then I obtained the Blessed Vision of His Darshan.
By pure lifestyle and meditation, all duality is removed.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the mind becomes immaculate.
Anxieties are forgotten, and the One Lord alone is seen,
O Nanak, by those whose eyes are anointed with the ointment of spiritual wisdom. ||22||
Shalok:
The heart is cooled and soothed, and the mind is at peace, chanting and singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe.
Show such Mercy, O God, that Nanak may become the slave of Your slaves. ||1||
Pauree:
CHHACHHA: I am Your child-slave.
I am the water-carrier of the slave of Your slaves.
Chhachha: I long to become the dust under the feet of Your Saints.
