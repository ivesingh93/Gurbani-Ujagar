Those whom You approve, are approved.
Such a celebrated and honored person is known everywhere. ||3||
Day and night, with every breath to worship and adore the Lord -
please, O True Supreme King, fulfill this, Nanak's desire. ||4||6||108||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
He, my Lord Master, is fully pervading all places.
He is the One Lord Master, the roof over our heads; there is no other than Him. ||1||
As it pleases Your Will, please save me, O Savior Lord.
Without You, my eyes see no other at all. ||1||Pause||
God Himself is the Cherisher; He takes care of each and every heart.
That person, within whose mind You Yourself dwell, never forgets You. ||2||
He does that which is pleasing to Himself.
He is known as the help and support of His devotees, throughout the ages. ||3||
Chanting and meditating up the Lord's Name, the mortal never comes to regret anything.
O Nanak, I thirst for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan; please, fulfill my desire, O Lord. ||4||7||109||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Why are you sleeping, and forgetting the Name, O careless and foolish mortal?
So many have been washed away and carried off by this river of life. ||1||
O mortal, get aboard the boat of the Lord's Lotus Feet, and cross over.
Twenty-four hours a day, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||1||Pause||
You may enjoy various pleasures, but they are useless without the Name.
Without devotion to the Lord, you shall die in sorrow, again and again. ||2||
You may dress and eat and apply scented oils to your body,
but without the meditative remembrance of the Lord, your body shall surely turn to dust, and you shall have to depart. ||3||
How very treacherous is this world-ocean; how very few realize this!
Salvation rests in the Lord's Sanctuary; O Nanak, this is your pre-ordained destiny. ||4||8||110||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
No one is anyone's companion; why take any pride in others?
With the Support of the One Name, this terrible world-ocean is crossed over. ||1||
You are the True Support of me, the poor mortal, O my Perfect True Guru.
Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, my mind is encouraged. ||1||Pause||
Royal powers, wealth, and worldly involvements are of no use at all.
The Kirtan of the Lord's Praise is my Support; this wealth is everlasting. ||2||
As many as are the pleasures of Maya, so many are the shadows they leave.
The Gurmukhs sing of the Naam, the treasure of peace. ||3||
You are the True Lord, the treasure of excellence; O God, You are deep and unfathomable.
The Lord Master is the hope and support of Nanak's mind. ||4||9||111||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Remembering Him, suffering is removed, and celestial peace is obtained.
Night and day, with your palms pressed together, meditate on the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||
He alone is Nanak's God, unto whom all beings belong.
He is totally pervading everywhere, the Truest of the True. ||1||Pause||
Inwardly and outwardly, He is my companion and my helper; He is the One to be realized.
Adoring Him, my mind is cured of all its ailments. ||2||
The Savior Lord is infinite; He saves us from the fire of the womb.
