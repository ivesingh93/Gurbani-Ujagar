O my mind, meditate, vibrate on the Lord, and all sins will be eradicated.
The Guru has enshrined the Lord, Har, Har, within my heart; I place my head on the Guru's Path. ||1||Pause||
Whoever tells me the stories of my Lord God, I would cut my mind into slices, and dedicate it to him.
The Perfect Guru has united me with the Lord, my Friend; I have sold myself at each and every store for the Guru's Word. ||1||
One may give donations in charity at Prayaag, and cut the body in two at Benares,
but without the Lord's Name, no one attains liberation, even though one may give away huge amounts of gold. ||2||
When one follows the Guru's Teachings, and sings the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises, the doors of the mind, held shut by deception, are thrown open again.
The three qualities are shattered, doubt and fear run away, and the clay pot of public opinion is broken. ||3||
They alone find the Perfect Guru in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, upon whose foreheads such pre-ordained destiny is inscribed.
Servant Nanak drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar; all his hunger and thirst are quenched. ||4||6|| Chhakaa 1.||
Maalee Gauraa, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O mind, true peace comes from serving the Lord.
Other services are false, and as punishment for them, the Messenger of Death bashes in one's head. ||1||Pause||
They alone join the Sangat, the Congregation, upon whose forehead such destiny is inscribed.
They are carried across the terrifying world-ocean by the Saints of the Infinite, Primal Lord God. ||1||
Serve forever at the feet of the Holy; renounce greed, emotional attachment and corruption.
Abandon all other hopes, and rest your hopes in the One Formless Lord. ||2||
Some are faithless cynics, deluded by doubt; without the Guru, there is only pitch darkness.
Whatever is pre-ordained, comes to pass; no one can erase it. ||3||
The beauty of the Lord of the Universe is profound and unfathomable; the Names of the Infinite Lord are innumerable.
Blessed, blessed are those humble beings, O Nanak, who enshrine the Lord's Name in their hearts. ||4||1||
Maalee Gauraa, Fifth Mehl:
I humbly bow to the Name of the Lord.
Chanting it, one is saved. ||1||Pause||
Meditating on Him in remembrance, conflicts are ended.
Meditating on Him, one's bonds are untied.
Meditating on Him, the fool becomes wise.
Meditating on Him, one's ancestors are saved. ||1||
Meditating on Him, fear and pain are taken away.
Meditating on Him, misfortune is avoided.
Meditating on Him, sins are erased.
Meditating on Him, agony is ended. ||2||
Meditating on Him, the heart blossoms forth.
Meditating on Him, Maya becomes one's slave.
Meditating on Him, one is blessed with the treasures of wealth.
Meditating on Him, one crosses over in the end. ||3||
The Name of the Lord is the Purifier of sinners.
It saves millions of devotees.
I am meek; I seek the Sanctuary of the slaves of the Lord's slaves.
Nanak lays his forehead on the feet of the Saints. ||4||2||
Maalee Gauraa, Fifth Mehl:
This is the sort of helper the Name of the Lord is.
Meditating in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, one's affairs are perfectly resolved. ||1||Pause||
It is like a boat to a drowning man.
