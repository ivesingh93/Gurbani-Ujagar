Kaydaaraa, Fourth Mehl, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O my mind, sing continually the Name of the Lord.
The Inaccessible, Unfathomable Lord cannot be seen; meeting with the Perfect Guru, He is seen. ||Pause||
That person, upon whom my Lord and Master showers His Mercy - the Lord attunes that one to Himself.
Everyone worships the Lord, but only that person who is pleasing to the Lord is accepted. ||1||
The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is priceless. It rests with the Lord. If the Lord bestows it, then we meditate on the Naam.
That person, whom my Lord and Master blesses with His Name - his entire account is forgiven. ||2||
Those humble beings who worship and adore the Lord's Name, are said to be blessed. Such is the good destiny written on their foreheads.
Gazing upon them, my mind blossoms forth, like the mother who meets with her son and hugs him close. ||3||
I am a child, and You, O my Lord God, are my Father; please bless me with such understanding, that I may find the Lord.
Like the cow, which is happy upon seeing her calf, O Lord, please hug Nanak close in Your Embrace. ||4||1||
Kaydaaraa, Fourth Mehl, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O my mind, chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord, Har, Har.
Wash the Feet of the True Guru, and worship them. In this way, you shall find my Lord God. ||Pause||
Sexual desire, anger, greed, attachment, egotism and corrupt pleasures - stay away from these.
Join the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, and speak with the Holy People about the Lord. The Love of the Lord is the healing remedy; the Name of the Lord is the healing remedy. Chant the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam. ||1||
