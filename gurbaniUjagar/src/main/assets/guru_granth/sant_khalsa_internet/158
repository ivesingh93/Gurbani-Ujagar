The mind becomes pure, when the True Lord dwells within.
When one dwells in Truth, all actions become true.
The ultimate action is to contemplate the Word of the Shabad. ||3||
Through the Guru, true service is performed.
How rare is that Gurmukh who recognizes the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
The Giver, the Great Giver, lives forever.
Nanak enshrines love for the Name of the Lord. ||4||1||21||
Gauree Gwaarayree, Third Mehl:
Those who obtain spiritual wisdom from the Guru are very rare.
Those who obtain this understanding from the Guru become acceptable.
Through the Guru, we intuitively contemplate the True One.
Through the Guru, the Gate of Liberation is found. ||1||
Through perfect good destiny, we come to meet the Guru.
The true ones are intuitively absorbed in the True Lord. ||1||Pause||
Meeting the Guru, the fire of desire is quenched.
Through the Guru, peace and tranquility come to dwell within the mind.
Through the Guru, we become pure, holy and true.
Through the Guru, we are absorbed in the Word of the Shabad. ||2||
Without the Guru, everyone wanders in doubt.
Without the Name, they suffer in terrible pain.
Those who meditate on the Naam become Gurmukh.
True honor is obtained through the Darshan, the Blessed Vision of the True Lord. ||3||
Why speak of any other? He alone is the Giver.
When He grants His Grace, union with the Shabad is obtained.
Meeting with my Beloved, I sing the Glorious Praises of the True Lord.
O Nanak, becoming true, I am absorbed in the True One. ||4||2||22||
Gauree Gwaarayree, Third Mehl:
True is that place, where the mind becomes pure.
True is the one who abides in Truth.
The True Bani of the Word is known throughout the four ages.
The True One Himself is everything. ||1||
Through the karma of good actions, one joins the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation.
Sing the Glories of the Lord, sitting in that place. ||1||Pause||
Burn this tongue, which loves duality,
which does not taste the sublime essence of the Lord, and which utters insipid words.
Without understanding, the body and mind become tasteless and insipid.
Without the Name, the miserable ones depart crying out in pain. ||2||
One whose tongue naturally and intuitively tastes the Lord's sublime essence,
by Guru's Grace, is absorbed in the True Lord.
Imbued with Truth, one contemplates the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
and drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar, from the immaculate stream within. ||3||
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is collected in the vessel of the mind.
Nothing is collected if the vessel is upside-down.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Naam abides within the mind.
O Nanak, True is that vessel of the mind, which thirsts for the Shabad. ||4||3||23||
Gauree Gwaarayree, Third Mehl:
Some sing on and on, but their minds do not find happiness.
In egotism, they sing, but it is wasted uselessly.
Those who love the Naam, sing the song.
They contemplate the True Bani of the Word, and the Shabad. ||1||
They sing on and on, if it pleases the True Guru.
Their minds and bodies are embellished and adorned, attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Some sing, and some perform devotional worship.
Without heart-felt love, the Naam is not obtained.
True devotional worship consists of love for the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
The devotee keeps his Beloved clasped tightly to his heart. ||2||
