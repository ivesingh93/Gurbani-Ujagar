Have Mercy upon me, and bless me with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||4||
He alone obtains something, who becomes the dust under the feet of all.
And he alone repeats the Naam, whom God causes to understand. ||1||Pause||2||8||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
Within the home of his own self, he does not even come to see his Lord and Master.
And yet, around his neck, he hangs a stone god. ||1||
The faithless cynic wanders around, deluded by doubt.
He churns water, and after wasting his life away, he dies. ||1||Pause||
That stone, which he calls his god,
that stone pulls him down and drowns him. ||2||
O sinner, you are untrue to your own self;
a boat of stone will not carry you across. ||3||
Meeting the Guru, O Nanak, I know my Lord and Master.
The Perfect Architect of Destiny is pervading and permeating the water, the land and the sky. ||4||3||9||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
How have you enjoyed your Dear Beloved?
O sister, please teach me, please show me. ||1||
Crimson, crimson, crimson - this is the color of the soul-bride,
who is imbued with the Love of her Beloved. ||1||Pause||
I wash Your Feet with my eye-lashes.
Wherever You send me, there I will go. ||2||
I would trade meditation, austerity, self-discipline and celibacy,
if I could only meet the Lord of my life, for even an instant. ||3||
She who eradicates her self-conceit, power and arrogant intellect,
O Nanak, is the true soul-bride. ||4||4||10||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
You are my Life, the very Support of my breath of life.
Gazing upon You, beholding You, my mind is soothed and comforted. ||1||
You are my Friend, You are my Beloved.
I shall never forget You. ||1||Pause||
I am Your indentured servant; I am Your slave.
You are my Great Lord and Master, the treasure of excellence. ||2||
There are millions of servants in Your Court - Your Royal Darbaar.
Each and every instant, You dwell with them. ||3||
I am nothing; everything is Yours.
Through and through, You abide with Nanak. ||4||5||11||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
His Mansions are so comfortable, and His gates are so lofty.
Within them, His beloved devotees dwell. ||1||
The Natural Speech of God is so very sweet.
How rare is that person, who sees it with his eyes. ||1||Pause||
There, in the arena of the congregation, the divine music of the Naad, the sound current, is sung.
There, the Saints celebrate with their Lord. ||2||
Neither birth nor death is there, neither pain nor pleasure.
The Ambrosial Nectar of the True Name rains down there. ||3||
From the Guru, I have come to know the mystery of this speech.
Nanak speaks the Bani of the Lord, Har, Har. ||4||6||12||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
By the Blessed Vision of their Darshan, millions of sins are erased.
Meeting with them, this terrifying world-ocean is crossed over||1||
They are my companions, and they are my dear friends,
who inspire me to remember the Lord's Name. ||1||Pause||
Hearing the Word of His Shabad, I am totally at peace.
When I serve Him, the Messenger of Death is chased away. ||2||
His comfort and consolation soothes and supports my mind.
Remembering Him in meditation, my face is radiant and bright. ||3||
God embellishes and supports His servants.
Nanak seeks the Protection of their Sanctuary; he is forever a sacrifice to them. ||4||7||13||
