He Himself is the water, He Himself gives the tooth-pick, and He Himself offers the mouthwash.
He Himself calls and seats the congregation, and He Himself bids them goodbye.
One whom the Lord Himself blesses with His Mercy - the Lord causes him to walk according to His Will. ||6||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Rituals and religions are all just entanglements; bad and good are bound up with them.
Those things done for the sake of children and spouse, in ego and attachment, are just more bonds.
Wherever I look, there I see the noose of attachment to Maya.
O Nanak, without the True Name, the world is engrossed in blind entanglements. ||1||
Fourth Mehl:
The blind receive the Divine Light, when they merge with the Will of the True Guru.
They break their bonds, and dwell in Truth, and the darkness of ignorance is dispelled.
They see that everything belongs to the One who created and fashioned the body.
Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Creator - the Creator preserves his honor. ||2||
Pauree:
When the Creator, sitting all by Himself, created the Universe, he did not consult with any of His servants;
so what can anyone take, and what can anyone give, when He did not create any other like Himself?
Then, after fashioning the world, the Creator blessed all with His blessings.
He Himself instructs us in His service, and as Gurmukh, we drink in His Ambrosial Nectar.
He Himself is formless, and He Himself is formed; whatever He Himself does, comes to pass. ||7||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
The Gurmukhs serve God forever; night and day, they are steeped in the Love of the True Lord.
They are in bliss forever, singing the Glorious Praises of the True Lord; in this world and in the next, they keep Him clasped to their hearts.
Their Beloved dwells deep within; the Creator pre-ordained this destiny.
O Nanak, He blends them into Himself; He Himself showers His Mercy upon them. ||1||
Third Mehl:
By merely talking and speaking, He is not found. Night and day, sing His Glorious Praises continually.
Without His Merciful Grace, no one finds Him; many have died barking and bewailing.
When the mind and body are saturated with the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Lord Himself comes to dwell in his mind.
O Nanak, by His Grace, He is found; He unites us in His Union. ||2||
Pauree:
He Himself is the Vedas, the Puraanas and all the Shaastras; He Himself chants them, and He Himself is pleased.
He Himself sits down to worship, and He Himself creates the world.
He Himself is a householder, and He Himself is a renunciate; He Himself utters the Unutterable.
He Himself is all goodness, and He Himself causes us to act; He Himself remains detached.
He Himself grants pleasure and pain; the Creator Himself bestows His gifts. ||8||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
O Shaykh, abandon your cruel nature; live in the Fear of God and give up your madness.
Through the Fear of the Guru, many have been saved; in this fear, find the Fearless Lord.
Pierce your stone heart with the Word of the Shabad; let peace and tranquility come to abide in your mind.
If good deeds are done in this state of peace, they are approved by the Lord and Master.
O Nanak, through sexual desire and anger, no one has ever found God - go, and ask any wise man. ||1||
Third Mehl:
