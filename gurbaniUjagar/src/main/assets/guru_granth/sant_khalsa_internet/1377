He obtains the treasure of liberation, and the difficult road to the Lord is not blocked. ||231||
Kabeer, whether is for an hour, half an hour, or half of that,
whatever it is, it is worthwhile to speak with the Holy. ||232||
Kabeer, those mortals who consume marijuana, fish and wine -
no matter what pilgrimages, fasts and rituals they follow, they will all go to hell. ||233||
Kabeer, I keep my eyes lowered, and enshrine my Friend within my heart.
I enjoy all pleasures with my Beloved, but I do not let anyone else know. ||234||
Twenty-four hours a day, every hour, my soul continues to look to You, O Lord.
Why should I keep my eyes lowered? I see my Beloved in every heart. ||235||
Listen, O my companions: my soul dwells in my Beloved, and my Beloved dwells in my soul.
I realize that there is no difference between my soul and my Beloved; I cannot tell whether my soul or my Beloved dwells in my heart. ||236||
Kabeer, the Brahmin may be the guru of the world, but he is not the Guru of the devotees.
He rots and dies in the perplexities of the four Vedas. ||237||
The Lord is like sugar, scattered in the sand; the elephant cannot pick it up.
Says Kabeer, the Guru has given me this sublime understanding: become an ant, and feed on it. ||238||
Kabeer, if you desire to play the game of love with the Lord, then cut off your head, and make it into a ball.
Lose yourself in the play of it, and then whatever will be, will be. ||239||
Kabeer, if you desire to play the game of love with the Lord, play it with someone with committment.
Pressing the unripe mustard seeds produces neither oil nor flour. ||240||
Searching, the mortal stumbles like a blind person, and does not recognize the Saint.
Says Naam Dayv, how can one obtain the Lord God, without His devotee? ||241||
Forsaking the Diamond of the Lord, the mortals put their hopes in another.
Those people shall go to hell; Ravi Daas speaks the Truth. ||242||
Kabeer, if you live the householder's life, then practice righteousness; otherwise, you might as well retire from the world.
If someone renounces the world, and then gets involved in worldly entanglements, he shall suffer terrible misfortune. ||243||
Shaloks Of Shaykh Fareed Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The day of the bride's wedding is pre-ordained.
On that day, the Messenger of Death, of whom she had only heard, comes and shows its face.
It breaks the bones of the body and pulls the helpless soul out.
That pre-ordained time of marriage cannot be avoided. Explain this to your soul.
The soul is the bride, and death is the groom. He will marry her and take her away.
After the body sends her away with its own hands, whose neck will it embrace?
The bridge to hell is narrower than a hair; haven't you heard of it with your ears?
Fareed, the call has come; be careful now - don't let yourself be robbed. ||1||
Fareed, it is so difficult to become a humble Saint at the Lord's Door.
