Malaar, Third Mehl, Ashtapadees, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
If it is in his karma, then he finds the True Guru; without such karma, He cannot be found.
He meets the True Guru, and he is transformed into gold, if it is the Lord's Will. ||1||
O my mind, focus your consciousness on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
The Lord is found through the True Guru, and then he remains merged with the True Lord. ||1||Pause||
Spiritual wisdom wells up through the True Guru, and then this cynicism is dispelled.
Through the True Guru, the Lord is realized, and then, he is not consigned to the womb of reincarnation ever again. ||2||
By Guru's Grace, the mortal dies in life, and by so dying, lives to practice the Word of the Shabad.
He alone finds the Door of Salvation, who eradicates self-conceit from within himself. ||3||
By Guru's Grace, the mortal is reincarnated into the Home of the Lord, having eradicated Maya from within.
If one controls the difficult mind, he is blessed with a discriminating intellect; he meets the Supreme Person, the Primal Lord God. ||4||
The world is unconscious, like a passing show; the mortal departs, having lost his capital.
The profit of the Lord is obtained in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation; by good karma, it is found. ||5||
Without the True Guru, no one finds it; see this in your mind, and consider this in your heart.
By great good fortune, the mortal finds the Guru, and crosses over the terrifying world-ocean. ||6||
The Name of the Lord is my Anchor and Support. I take only the Support of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
O Dear Lord, please be kind and lead me to meet the Guru, that I may find the Door of Salvation. ||7||
The pre-ordained destiny inscribed on the mortal's forehead by our Lord and Master cannot be erased.
O Nanak, those humble beings are perfect, who are pleased by the Lord's Will. ||8||1||
Malaar, Third Mehl:
The world is involved with the words of the Vedas, thinking about the three gunas - the three dispositions.
Without the Name, it suffers punishment by the Messenger of Death; it comes and goes in reincarnation, over and over again.
Meeting with the True Guru, the world is liberated, and finds the Door of Salvation. ||1||
O mortal, immerse yourself in service to the True Guru.
By great good fortune, the mortal finds the Perfect Guru, and meditates on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||Pause||
The Lord, by the Pleasure of His Own Will, created the Universe, and the Lord Himself gives it sustenance and support.
The Lord, by His Own Will, makes the mortal's mind immaculate, and lovingly attunes him to the Lord.
The Lord, by His Own Will, leads the mortal to meet the True Guru, the Embellisher of all his lives. ||2||
Waaho! Waaho! Blessed and Great is the True Word of His Bani. Only a few, as Gurmukh, understand.
Waaho! Waaho! Praise God as Great! No one else is as Great as He.
When God's Grace is received, He Himself forgives the mortal, and unites him with Himself. ||3||
The True Guru has revealed our True, Supreme Lord and Master.
The Ambrosial Nectar rains down and the mind is satisfied, remaining lovingly attuned to the True Lord.
In the Lord's Name, it is forever rejuvenated; it shall never wither and dry up again. ||4||
