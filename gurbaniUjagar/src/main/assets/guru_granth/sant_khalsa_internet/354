O my soul, vibrate on the Profound, Unfathomable Lord. ||1||Pause||
Loving devotion to the Lord brings endless waves of joy and delight.
One who dwells with the Glorious Praises of the Lord, night and day, is sanctified.
The birth into the world of the faithless cynic is totally useless.
The humble devotee of the Lord remains unattached. ||2||
The body which sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord is sanctified.
The soul remains conscious of the Lord, absorbed in His Love.
The Lord is the Infinite Primal Being, beyond the beyond, the priceless jewel.
My mind is totally content, imbued with my Beloved. ||3||
Those who speak and babble on and on, are truly dead.
God is not far away - O God, You are right here.
I have seen that the whole world is engrossed in Maya.
O Nanak, through the Guru's Teachings, I meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||17||
Aasaa, First Mehl, Ti-Tukas:
One is a beggar, living on charity;
another is a king, absorbed in himself.
One receives honor, and another dishonor.
The Lord destroys and creates; He is enshrined in His meditation.
There is no other as great as You.
So whom should I present to You? Who is good enough? ||1||
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is my only Support.
You are the Great Giver, the Doer, the Creator. ||1||Pause||
I have not walked on Your Path; I have followed the crooked path.
In the Court of the Lord, I find no place to sit.
I am mentally blind, in the bondage of Maya.
The wall of my body is breaking down, wearing away, growing weaker.
You have such high hopes of eating and living -
your breaths and morsels of food are already counted! ||2||
Night and day they are blind - please, bless them with Your Light.
They are drowning in the terrifying world-ocean, crying out in pain.
Who chant, hear and believe in the Name,
I am a sacrifice to those.
Nanak utters this one prayer;
soul and body, all belong to You, Lord. ||3||
When You bless me, I chant Your Name.
Thus I find my seat in the Court of the Lord.
When it pleases You, evil-mindedness departs,
and the jewel of spiritual wisdom comes to dwell in the mind.
When the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace, then one comes to meet the True Guru.
Prays Nanak, carry us across the terrifying world-ocean. ||4||18||
Aasaa, First Mehl, Panch-Padas:
A cow without milk; a bird without wings; a garden without water - totally useless!
What is an emperor, without respect? The chamber of the soul is so dark, without the Name of the Lord. ||1||
How could I ever forget You? It would be so painful!
I would suffer such pain - no, I shall not forget You! ||1||Pause||
The eyes grow blind, the tongue does not taste, and the ears do not hear any sound.
He walks on his feet only when supported by someone else; without serving the Lord, such are the fruits of life. ||2||
The Word is the tree; the garden of the heart is the farm; tend it, and irrigate it with the Lord's Love.
All these trees bear the fruit of the Name of the One Lord; but without the karma of good actions, how can anyone obtain it? ||3||
As many living beings are there are, they are all Yours. Without selfless service, no one obtains any reward.
Pain and pleasure come by Your Will; without the Name, the soul does not even exist. ||4||
To die in the Teachings is to live. Otherwise, what is life? That is not the way.
Says Nanak, He grants life to the living beings; O Lord, please keep me according to Your Will. ||5||19||
