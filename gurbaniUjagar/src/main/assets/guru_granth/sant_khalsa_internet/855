Pauree:
If someone slanders the True Guru, and then comes seeking the Guru's Protection,
the True Guru forgives him for his past sins, and unites him with the Saints' Congregation.
When the rain falls, the water in the streams, rivers and ponds flows into the Ganges; flowing into the Ganges, it is made sacred and pure.
Such is the glorious greatness of the True Guru, who has no vengeance; meeting with Him, thirst and hunger are quenched, and instantly, one attains celestial peace.
O Nanak, behold this wonder of the Lord, my True King! Everyone is pleased with one who obeys and believes in the True Guru. ||13||1|| Sudh||
Bilaaval, The Word Of The Devotees.
Of Kabeer Jee:
One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified By Guru's Grace:
This world is a drama; no one can remain here.
Walk the straight path; otherwise, you will be pushed around. ||1||Pause||
The children, the young and the old, O Siblings of Destiny, will be taken away by the Messenger of Death.
The Lord has made the poor man a mouse, and the cat of Death is eating him up. ||1||
It gives no special consideration to either the rich or the poor.
The king and his subjects are equally killed; such is the power of Death. ||2||
Those who are pleasing to the Lord are the servants of the Lord; their story is unique and singular.
They do not come and go, and they never die; they remain with the Supreme Lord God. ||3||
Know this in your soul, that by renouncing your children, spouse, wealth and property -
says Kabeer, listen, O Saints - you shall be united with the Lord of the Universe. ||4||1||
Bilaaval:
I do not read books of knowledge, and I do not understand the debates.
I have gone insane, chanting and hearing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||
O my father, I have gone insane; the whole world is sane, and I am insane.
I am spoiled; let no one else be spoiled like me. ||1||Pause||
I have not made myself go insane - the Lord made me go insane.
The True Guru has burnt away my doubt. ||2||
I am spoiled; I have lost my intellect.
Let no one go astray in doubt like me. ||3||
He alone is insane, who does not understand himself.
When he understands himself, then he knows the One Lord. ||4||
One who is not intoxicated with the Lord now, shall never be intoxicated.
Says Kabeer, I am imbued with the Lord's Love. ||5||2||
Bilaaval:
Abandoning his household, he may go to the forest, and live by eating roots;
but even so, his sinful, evil mind does not renounce corruption. ||1||
How can anyone be saved? How can anyone cross over the terrifying world-ocean?
Save me, save me, O my Lord! Your humble servant seeks Your Sanctuary. ||1||Pause||
I cannot escape my desire for sin and corruption.
I make all sorts of efforts to hold back from this desire, but it clings to me, again and again. ||2||
