Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
O Husband Lord, You have given me the silk gown of Your Love to cover and protect my honor.
You are all-wise and all-knowing, O my Master; Nanak: I have not appreciated Your value, Lord. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
By Your meditative remembrance, I have found everything; nothing seems difficult to me.
One whose honor the True Lord Master has preserved - O Nanak, no one can dishonor him. ||2||
Pauree:
Meditating on the Lord, there comes a great peace.
Multitudes of illnesses vanish, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
Utter peace pervades within, when God comes to mind.
One's hopes are fulfilled, when one's mind is filled with the Name.
No obstacles stand in the way, when one eliminates his self-conceit.
The intellect attains the blessing of spiritual wisdom from the Guru.
He receives everything, unto whom the Lord Himself gives.
You are the Lord and Master of all; all are under Your Protection. ||8||
Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
Crossing the stream, my foot does not get stuck - I am filled with love for You.
O Lord, my heart is attached to Your Feet; the Lord is Nanak's raft and boat. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
The sight of them banishes my evil-mindedness; they are my only true friends.
I have searched the whole world; O servant Nanak, how rare are such persons! ||2||
Pauree:
You come to mind, O Lord and Master, when I behold Your devotees.
The filth of my mind is removed, when I dwell in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
The fear of birth and death is dispelled, meditating on the Word of His humble servant.
The Saints untie the bonds, and all the demons are dispelled.
They inspire us to love Him, the One who established the entire universe.
The seat of the inaccessible and infinite Lord is the highest of the high.
Night and day, with your palms pressed together, with each and every breath, meditate on Him.
When the Lord Himself becomes merciful, then we attain the Society of His devotees. ||9||
Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
In this wondrous forest of the world, there is chaos and confusion; shrieks emanate from the highways.
I am in love with You, O my Husband Lord; O Nanak, I cross the jungle joyfully. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
The true society is the company of those who meditate on the Name of the Lord.
Do not associate with those, O Nanak, who look out only for their own interests. ||2||
Pauree:
Approved is that time, when one meets the True Guru.
Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, he does not suffer pain again.
When he attains the eternal place, he does not have to enter the womb again.
He comes to see the One God everywhere.
He focuses his meditation on the essence of spiritual wisdom, and withdraws his attention from other sights.
All chants are chanted by one who chants them with his mouth.
Realizing the Hukam of the Lord's Command, he becomes happy, and he is filled with peace and tranquility.
Those who are assayed, and placed in the Lord's treasury, are not declared counterfeit again. ||10||
Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
The pincers of separation are so painful to endure.
If only the Master would come to meet me! O Nanak, I would then obtain all the true comforts. ||1||
