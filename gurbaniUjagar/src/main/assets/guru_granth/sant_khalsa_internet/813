Merciful to the meek, the treasure of mercy, He remembers and protects us with each and every breath. ||2||
Whatever the Creator Lord does is glorious and great.
The Perfect Guru has instructed me, that peace comes by the Will of our Lord and Master. ||3||
Anxieties, worries and calculations are dismissed; the Lord's humble servant accepts the Hukam of His Command.
He does not die, and He does not leave; Nanak is attuned to His Love. ||4||18||48||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
The great fire is put out and cooled; meeting with the Guru, sins run away.
I fell into the deep dark pit; giving me His Hand, He pulled me out. ||1||
He is my friend; I am the dust of His Feet.
Meeting with Him, I am at peace; He blesses me with the gift of the soul. ||1||Pause||
I have now received my pre-ordained destiny.
Dwelling with the Lord's Holy Saints, my hopes are fulfilled. ||2||
The fear of the three worlds is dispelled, and I have found my place of rest and peace.
The all-powerful Guru has taken pity upon me, and the Naam has come to dwell in my mind. ||3||
O God, You are the Anchor and Support of Nanak.
He is the Doer, the Cause of causes; the All-powerful Lord God is inaccessible and infinite. ||4||19||49||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
One who forgets God is filthy, poor and low.
The fool does not understand the Creator Lord; instead, he thinks that he himself is the doer. ||1||
Pain comes, when one forgets Him. Peace comes when one remembers God.
This is the way the Saints are in bliss - they continually sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
The high, He makes low, and the low, he elevates in an instant.
The value of the glory of our Lord and Master cannot be estimated. ||2||
While he gazes upon beautiful dramas and plays, the day of his departure dawns.
The dream becomes the dream, and his actions do not go along with him. ||3||
God is All-powerful, the Cause of causes; I seek Your Sanctuary.
Day and night, Nanak meditates on the Lord; forever and ever he is a sacrifice. ||4||20||50||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
I carry water on my head, and with my hands I wash their feet.
Tens of thousands of times, I am a sacrifice to them; gazing upon the Blessed Vision of their Darshan, I live. ||1||
The hopes which I cherish in my mind - my God fulfills them all.
With my broom, I sweep the homes of the Holy Saints, and wave the fan over them. ||1||Pause||
The Saints chant the Ambrosial Praises of the Lord; I listen, and my mind drinks it in.
That sublime essence calms and soothes me, and quenches the fire of sin and corruption. ||2||
When the galaxy of Saints worship the Lord in devotion, I join them, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
I bow in reverence to the humble devotees, and apply the dust of their feet to my face. ||3||
Sitting down and standing up, I chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord; this is what I do.
This is Nanak's prayer to God, that he may merge in the Lord's Sanctuary. ||4||21||51||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
He alone crosses over this world-ocean, who sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
He dwells with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; by great good fortune, he finds the Lord. ||1||
