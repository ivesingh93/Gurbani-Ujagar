He is within - see Him outside as well; there is no one, other than Him.
As Gurmukh, look upon all with the single eye of equality; in each and every heart, the Divine Light is contained. ||2||
Restrain your fickle mind, and keep it steady within its own home; meeting the Guru, this understanding is obtained.
Seeing the unseen Lord, you shall be amazed and delighted; forgetting your pain, you shall be at peace. ||3||
Drinking in the ambrosial nectar, you shall attain the highest bliss, and dwell within the home of your own self.
So sing the Praises of the Lord, the Destroyer of the fear of birth and death, and you shall not be reincarnated again. ||4||
The essence, the immaculate Lord, the Light of all - I am He and He is me - there is no difference between us.
The Infinite Transcendent Lord, the Supreme Lord God - Nanak has met with Him, the Guru. ||5||11||
Sorat'h, First Mehl, Third House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
When I am pleasing to Him, then I sing His Praises.
Singing His Praises, I receive the fruits of my rewards.
The rewards of singing His Praises are obtained,
when He Himself gives them. ||1||
O my mind, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the treasure is obtained;
this is why I remain immersed in the True Name. ||Pause||
When I awoke within myself to the Guru's Teachings,
then I renounced my fickle intellect.
When the Light of the Guru's Teachings dawned,
and then all darkness was dispelled. ||2||
When the mind is attached to the Guru's Feet,
then the Path of Death recedes.
Through the Fear of God, one attains the Fearless Lord;
then, one enters the home of celestial bliss. ||3||
Prays Nanak, how rare are those who reflect and understand,
the most sublime action in this world.
The noblest deed is to sing the Lord's Praises,
and so meet the Lord Himself. ||4||1||12||
Sorat'h, Third Mehl, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
All of Your servants, who relish the Word of Your Shabad, serve You.
By Guru's Grace, they become pure, eradicating self-conceit from within.
Night and day, they continually sing the Glorious Praises of the True Lord; they are adorned with the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||1||
O my Lord and Master, I am Your child; I seek Your Sanctuary.
You are the One and Only Lord, the Truest of the True; You Yourself are the Destroyer of ego. ||Pause||
Those who remain wakeful obtain God; through the Word of the Shabad, they conquer their ego.
Immersed in family life, the Lord's humble servant ever remains detached; he reflects upon the essence of spiritual wisdom.
Serving the True Guru, he finds eternal peace, and he keeps the Lord enshrined in his heart. ||2||
This mind wanders in the ten directions; it is consumed by the love of duality.
