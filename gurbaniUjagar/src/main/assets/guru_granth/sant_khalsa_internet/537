Raag Bihaagraa, Chau-Padas, Fifth Mehl, Second House:
To associate with those indulging in unethical pursuits,
is to live with poisonous snakes;
that have destroyed many. ||1||
Then, I repeated the Name of the Lord, Har, Har,
and I obtained celestial peace. ||1||Pause||
False is the love of,
many emotional attachments,
which suck the mortal into the whirlpool of reincarnation. ||2||
All are travelers,
who have gathered under the world-tree,
and are bound by their many bonds. ||3||
Eternal is the Company of the Holy,
where the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises are sung.
Nanak seeks this Sanctuary. ||4||1||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Raag Bihaagraa, Ninth Mehl:
No one knows the state of the Lord.
The Yogis, the celibates, the penitents, and all sorts of clever people have failed. ||1||Pause||
In an instant, He changes the beggar into a king, and the king into a beggar.
He fills what is empty, and empties what is full - such are His ways. ||1||
He Himself spread out the expanse of His Maya, and He Himself beholds it.
He assumes so many forms, and plays so many games, and yet, He remains detached from it all. ||2||
Incalculable, infinite, incomprehensible and immaculate is He, who has misled the entire world.
Cast off all your doubts; prays Nanak, O mortal, focus your consciousness on His Feet. ||3||1||2||
Raag Bihaagraa, Chhant, Fourth Mehl, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my soul; as Gurmukh, meditate on the invaluable Name of the Lord.
My mind is pierced through by the sublime essence of the Lord's Name. The Lord is dear to my mind. With the sublime essence of the Lord's Name, my mind is washed clean.
