The Creator Himself enjoys all delights.
Whatever He does, surely comes to pass.
He is the Great Giver; He has no greed at all.
O Nanak, living the Word of the Shabad, the mortal meets with God. ||4||6||
Basant, Third Mehl:
By perfect destiny, one acts in truth.
Remembering the One Lord, one does not have to enter the cycle of reincarnation.
Fruitful is the coming into the world, and the life of one
who remains intuitively absorbed in the True Name. ||1||
The Gurmukh acts, lovingly attuned to the Lord.
Be dedicated to the Lord's Name, and eradicate self-conceit from within. ||1||Pause||
True is the speech of that humble being;
through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, it is spread throughout the world.
Throughout the four ages, his fame and glory spread.
Imbued with the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the Lord's humble servant is recognized and renowned. ||2||
Some remain lovingly attuned to the True Word of the Shabad.
True are those humble beings who love the True Lord.
They meditate on the True Lord, and behold Him near at hand, ever-present.
They are the dust of the lotus feet of the humble Saints. ||3||
There is only One Creator Lord; there is no other at all.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, comes Union with the Lord.
Whoever serves the True Lord finds joy.

are blessed with understanding by the Perfect True Guru. ||1||
How rare are those who become the slave of the Lord's slaves.

So serve the One Lord, and no other.
Serving Him, eternal peace is obtained.
He does not die; He does not come and go in reincarnation.
Why should I serve any other than Him, O my mother? ||2||
True are those humble beings who realize the True Lord.
Conquering their self-conceit, they merge intuitively into the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
The Gurmukhs gather in the Naam.
Their minds are immaculate, and their reputations are immaculate. ||3||
Know the Lord, who gave you spiritual wisdom,
and realize the One God, through the True Word of the Shabad.
When the mortal tastes the sublime essence of the Lord, he becomes pure and holy.
O Nanak, those who are imbued with the Naam - their reputations are true. ||4||8||
Basant, Third Mehl:
Those who are imbued with the Naam, the Name of the Lord - their generations are redeemed and saved.
True is their speech; they love the Naam.
Why have the wandering self-willed manmukhs even come into the world?
Forgetting the Naam, the mortals waste their lives away. ||1||
One who dies while yet alive, truly dies, and embellishes his death.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he enshrines the True Lord within his heart. ||1||Pause||
Truth is the food of the Gurmukh; his body is sanctified and pure.
His mind is immaculate; he is forever the ocean of virtue.
He is not forced to come and go in the cycle of birth and death.
By Guru's Grace, he merges in the True Lord. ||2||
Serving the True Lord, one realizes Truth.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he goes to the Lord's Court with his banners flying proudly.
