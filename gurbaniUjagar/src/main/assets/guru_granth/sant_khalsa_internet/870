Raag Gond, The Word Of The Devotees.
Kabeer Jee, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
When you meet a Saint, talk to him and listen.
Meeting with an unsaintly person, just remain silent. ||1||
O father, if I speak, what words should I utter?
Speak such words, by which you may remain absorbed in the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Speaking with the Saints, one becomes generous.
To speak with a fool is to babble uselessly. ||2||
By speaking and only speaking, corruption only increases.
If I do not speak, what can the poor wretch do? ||3||
Says Kabeer, the empty pitcher makes noise,
but that which is full makes no sound. ||4||1||
Gond:
When a man dies, he is of no use to anyone.
But when an animal dies, it is used in ten ways. ||1||
What do I know, about the state of my karma?
What do I know, O Baba? ||1||Pause||
His bones burn, like a bundle of logs;
his hair burns like a bale of hay. ||2||
Says Kabeer, the man wakes up,
only when the Messenger of Death hits him over the head with his club. ||3||2||
Gond:
The Celestial Lord is in the Akaashic ethers of the skIEs, the Celestial Lord is in the nether regions of the underworld; in the four directions, the Celestial Lord is pervading.
The Supreme Lord God is forever the source of bliss. When the vessel of the body perishes, the Celestial Lord does not perish. ||1||
I have become sad,
wondering where the soul comes from, and where it goes. ||1||Pause||
The body is formed from the union of the five tattvas; but where were the five tattvas created?
You say that the soul is tied to its karma, but who gave karma to the body? ||2||
The body is contained in the Lord, and the Lord is contained in the body. He is permeating within all.
Says Kabeer, I shall not renounce the Lord's Name. I shall accept whatever happens. ||3||3||
Raag Gond, The Word Of Kabeer Jee, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
They tied my arms, bundled me up, and threw me before an elephant.
The elephant driver struck him on the head, and infuriated him.
But the elephant ran away, trumpeting,
I am a sacrifice to this image of the Lord". ||1||
O my Lord and Master, You are my strength.
The Qazi shouted at the driver to drive the elephant on. ||1||Pause||
He yelled out, "O driver, I shall cut you into pieces.
Hit him, and drive him on!
But the elephant did not move; instead, he began to meditate.
The Lord God abides within his mind. ||2||
What sin has this Saint committed,
that you have made him into a bundle and thrown him before the elephant?
Lifting up the bundle, the elephant bows down before it.
The Qazi could not understand it; he was blind. ||3||
Three times, he tried to do it.
