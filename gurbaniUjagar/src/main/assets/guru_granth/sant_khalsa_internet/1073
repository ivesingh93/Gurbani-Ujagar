The body-bride is blind, and the groom is clever and wise.
The creation was created of the five elements.
That merchandise, for which you have come into the world, is received only from the True Guru. ||6||
The body-bride says, "Please live with me,
O my beloved, peaceful, young lord.
Without you, I am of no account. Please give me your word, that you will not leave me". ||7||
The soul-husband says, "I am the slave of my Commander.
He is my Great Lord and Master, who is fearless and independent.
As long as He wills, I will remain with you. When He summons me, I shall arise and depart". ||8||
The husband speaks words of Truth to the bride,
but the bride is restless and inexperienced, and she does not understand anything.
Again and again, she begs her husband to stay; she thinks that he is just joking when he answers her. ||9||
The Order comes, and the husband-soul is called.
He does not consult with his bride, and does not ask her opinion.
He gets up and marches off, and the discarded body-bride mingles with dust. O Nanak, behold the illusion of emotional attachment and hope. ||10||
O greedy mind - listen, O my mind!
Serve the True Guru day and night forever.
Without the True Guru, the faithless cynics rot away and die. The noose of Death is around the necks of those who have no Guru. ||11||
The self-willed manmukh comes, and the self-willed manmukh goes.
The manmukh suffers beatings again and again.
The manmukh endures as many hells as there are; the Gurmukh is not even touched by them. ||12||
He alone is Gurmukh, who is pleasing to the Dear Lord.
Who can destroy anyone who is robed in honor by the Lord?
The blissful one is forever in bliss; he is dressed in robes of honor. ||13||
I am a sacrifice to the Perfect True Guru.
He is the Giver of Sanctuary, the Heroic Warrior who keeps His Word.
Such is the Lord God, the Giver of peace, whom I have met; He shall never leave me or go anywhere else. ||14||
He is the treasure of virtue; His value cannot be estimated.
He is perfectly permeating each and every heart, prevailing everywhere.
Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Destroyer of the pains of the poor; I am the dust of the feet of Your slaves. ||15||1||2||
Maaroo, Solahas, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
My Blissful Lord is forever in bliss.
He fills each and every heart, and judges each and everyone.
The True Lord and Master is above the heads of all kings; there is none other than Him. ||1||
He is joyful, blissful and merciful.
God's Light is manifest everywhere.
He creates forms, and gazing upon them, He enjoys them; He Himself worships Himself. ||2||
He contemplates His own creative power.
The True Lord Himself creates the expanse of the Universe.
He Himself stages the play, day and night; He Himself listens, and hearing, rejoices. ||3||
True is His throne, and True is His kingdom.
True is the treasure of the True Banker.
