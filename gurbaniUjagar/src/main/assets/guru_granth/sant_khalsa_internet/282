He Himself is All-in-Himself.
In His many ways, He establishes and disestablishes.
He is Imperishable; nothing can be broken.
He lends His Support to maintain the Universe.
Unfathomable and Inscrutable is the Glory of the Lord.
As He inspires us to meditate, O Nanak, so do we meditate. ||6||
Those who know God are glorious.
The whole world is redeemed by their teachings.
God's servants redeem all.
God's servants cause sorrows to be forgotten.
The Merciful Lord unites them with Himself.
Chanting the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they become ecstatic.
He alone is committed to serve them,
upon whom God bestows His Mercy, by great good fortune.
Those who chant the Naam find their place of rest.
O Nanak, respect those persons as the most noble. ||7||
Whatever you do, do it for the Love of God.
Forever and ever, abide with the Lord.
By its own natural course, whatever will be will be.
Acknowledge that Creator Lord;
God's doings are sweet to His humble servant.
As He is, so does He appear.
From Him we came, and into Him we shall merge again.
He is the treasure of peace, and so does His servant become.
Unto His own, He has given His honor.
O Nanak, know that God and His humble servant are one and the same. ||8||14||
Shalok:
God is totally imbued with all powers; He is the Knower of our troubles.
Meditating in remembrance on Him, we are saved; Nanak is a sacrifice to Him. ||1||
Ashtapadee:
The Lord of the World is the Mender of the broken.
He Himself cherishes all beings.
The cares of all are on His Mind;
no one is turned away from Him.
O my mind, meditate forever on the Lord.
The Imperishable Lord God is Himself All-in-all.
By one's own actions, nothing is accomplished,
even though the mortal may wish it so, hundreds of times.
Without Him, nothing is of any use to you.
Salvation, O Nanak, is attained by chanting the Name of the One Lord. ||1||
One who is good-looking should not be vain;
the Light of God is in all hearts.
Why should anyone be proud of being rich?
All riches are His gifts.
One may call himself a great hero,
but without God's Power, what can anyone do?
One who brags about giving to charities -
the Great Giver shall judge him to be a fool.
One who, by Guru's Grace, is cured of the disease of ego -
O Nanak, that person is forever healthy. ||2||
As a palace is supported by its pillars,
so does the Guru's Word support the mind.
As a stone placed in a boat can cross over the river,
so is the mortal saved, grasping hold of the Guru's Feet.
As the darkness is illuminated by the lamp,
so does the mind blossom forth, beholding the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan.
The path is found through the great wilderness,
by joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and one's light shines forth.
I seek the dust of the feet of those Saints;
O Lord, fulfill Nanak's longing! ||3||
O foolish mind, why do you cry and bewail?
