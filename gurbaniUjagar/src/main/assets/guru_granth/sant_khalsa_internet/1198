This is the way to meet your Husband Lord. Blessed is the soul-bride who is loved by her Husband Lord.
Social class and status, race, ancestry and skepticism are eliminated, following the Guru's Teachings and contemplating the Word of the Shabad. ||1||
One whose mind is pleased and appeased, has no egotistical pride. Violence and greed are forgotten.
The soul-bride intuitively ravishes and enjoys her Husband Lord; as Gurmukh, she is embellished by His Love. ||2||
Burn away any love of family and relatives, which increases your attachment to Maya.
One who does not savor the Lord's Love deep within, lives in duality and corruption. ||3||
His Love is a priceless jewel deep within my being; the Lover of my Beloved is not hidden.
O Nanak, as Gurmukh, enshrine the Priceless Naam deep within your being, all the ages through. ||4||3||
Saarang, Fourth Mehl, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
I am the dust of the feet of the humble Saints of the Lord.
Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, I have obtained the supreme status. The Lord, the Supreme Soul, is all-pervading everywhere. ||1||Pause||
Meeting the Saintly True Guru, I have found peace and tranquility. Sins and painful mistakes are totally erased and taken away.
The Divine Light of the soul radiates forth, gazing upon the Presence of the Immaculate Lord God. ||1||
By great good fortune, I have found the Sat Sangat; the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is all-pervading everywhere.
I have taken my cleansing bath at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage, bathing in the dust of the feet of the True Congregation. ||2||
Evil-minded and corrupt, filthy-minded and shallow, with impure heart, attached to enticement and falsehood.
Without good karma, how can I find the Sangat? Engrossed in egotism, the mortal remains stuck in regret. ||3||
Be kind and show Your Mercy, O Dear Lord; I beg for the dust of the feet of the Sat Sangat.
O Nanak, meeting with the Saints, the Lord is attained. The Lord's humble servant obtains the Presence of the Lord. ||4||1||
Saarang, Fourth Mehl:
I am a sacrifice to the Feet of the Lord of the Universe.
I cannot swim across the terrifying world ocean. But chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, I am carried across. ||1||Pause||
Faith in God came to fill my heart; I serve Him intuitively, and contemplate Him.
Night and day, I chant the Lord's Name within my heart; it is all-powerful and virtuous. ||1||
God is Inaccessible and Unfathomable, All-pervading everywhere, in all minds and bodies; He is Infinite and Invisible.
When the Guru becomes merciful, then the Unseen Lord is seen within the heart. ||2||
Deep within the inner being is the Name of the Lord, the Support of the entire earth, but to the egotistical shaakta, the faithless cynic, He seems far away.
His burning desire is never quenched, and he loses the game of life in the gamble. ||3||
Standing up and sitting down, the mortal sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, when the Guru bestows even a tiny bit of His Grace.
O Nanak, those who are blessed by His Glance of Grace - He saves and protects their honor. ||4||2||
