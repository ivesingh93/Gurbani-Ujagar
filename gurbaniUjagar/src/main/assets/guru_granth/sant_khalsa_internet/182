It torments us with the expression of pleasure and pain.
It torments us through incarnations in heaven and hell.
It is seen to afflict the rich, the poor and the glorious.
The source of this illness which torments us is greed. ||1||
Maya torments us in so many ways.
But the Saints live under Your Protection, God. ||1||Pause||
It torments us through intoxication with intellectual pride.
It torments us through the love of children and spouse.
It torments us through elephants, horses and beautiful clothes.
It torments us through the intoxication of wine and the beauty of youth. ||2||
It torments landlords, paupers and lovers of pleasure.
It torments us through the sweet sounds of music and parties.
It torments us through beautiful beds, palaces and decorations.
It torments us through the darkness of the five evil passions. ||3||
It torments those who act, entangled in ego.
It torments us through household affairs, and it torments us in renunciation.
It torments us through character, lifestyle and social status.
It torments us through everything, except for those who are imbued with the Love of the Lord. ||4||
The Sovereign Lord King has cut away the bonds of His Saints.
How can Maya torment them?
Says Nanak, who have obtained the dust of the feet of the Saints,
Maya does not draw near them. ||5||19||88||
Gauree Gwaarayree, Fifth Mehl:
The eyes are asleep in corruption, gazing upon the beauty of another.
The ears are asleep, listening to slanderous stories.
The tongue is asleep, in its desire for sweet flavors.
The mind is asleep, fascinated by Maya. ||1||
Those who remain awake in this house are very rare;
by doing so, they receive the whole thing. ||1||Pause||
All of my companions are intoxicated with their sensory pleasures;
they do not know how to guard their own home.
The five thieves have plundered them;
the thugs descend upon the unguarded village. ||2||
Our mothers and fathers cannot save us from them;
friends and brothers cannot protect us from them -
they cannot be restrained by wealth or cleverness.
Only through the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, can those villains be brought under control. ||3||
Have Mercy upon me, O Lord, Sustainer of the world.
The dust of the feet of the Saints is all the treasure I need.
In the Company of the True Guru, one's investment remains intact.
Nanak is awake to the Love of the Supreme Lord. ||4||
He alone is awake, unto whom God shows His Mercy.
This investment, wealth and property shall remain intact. ||1||Second. Pause||20||89||
Gauree Gwaarayree, Fifth Mehl:
Kings and emperors are under His Power.
The whole world is under His Power.
Everything is done by His doing;
other than Him, there is nothing at all. ||1||
Offer your prayers to your True Guru;
He will resolve your affairs. ||1||Pause||
The Darbaar of His Court is the most exalted of all.
His Name is the Support of all His devotees.
The Perfect Master is pervading everywhere.
His Glory is manifest in each and every heart. ||2||
Remembering Him in meditation, the home of sorrow is abolished.
Remembering Him in meditation, the Messenger of Death shall not touch you.
Remembering Him in meditation, the dry branches become green again.
