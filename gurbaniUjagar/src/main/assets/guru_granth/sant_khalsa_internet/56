With false mouths, people speak falsehood. How can they be made pure?
Without the Holy Water of the Shabad, they are not cleansed. From the True One alone comes Truth. ||1||
O soul-bride, without virtue, what happiness can there be?
The Husband Lord enjoys her with pleasure and delight; she is at peace in the love of the True Word of the Shabad. ||1||Pause||
When the Husband goes away, the bride suffers in the pain of separation,
like the fish in shallow water, crying for mercy.
As it pleases the Will of the Husband Lord, peace is obtained, when He Himself casts His Glance of Grace. ||2||
Praise your Husband Lord, together with your bridesmaids and friends.
The body is beautified, and the mind is fascinated. Imbued with His Love, we are enraptured.
Adorned with the Shabad, the beautiful bride enjoys her Husband with virtue. ||3||
The soul-bride is of no use at all, if she is evil and without virtue.
She does not find peace in this world or the next; she burns in falsehood and corruption.
Coming and going are very difficult for that bride who is abandoned and forgotten by her Husband Lord. ||4||
The beautiful soul-bride of the Husband Lord-by what sensual pleasures has she been doomed?
She is of no use to her Husband if she babbles in useless arguments.
At the Door of His Home, she finds no shelter; she is discarded for seeking other pleasures. ||5||
The Pandits, the religious scholars, read their books, but they do not understand the real meaning.
They give instructions to others, and then walk away, but they deal in Maya themselves.
Speaking falsehood, they wander around the world, while those who remain true to the Shabad are excellent and exalted. ||6||
There are so many Pandits and astrologers who ponder over the Vedas.
They glorify their disputes and arguments, and in these controversies they continue coming and going.
Without the Guru, they are not released from their karma, although they speak and listen and preach and explain. ||7||
They all call themselves virtuous, but I have no virtue at all.
With the Lord as her Husband, the soul-bride is happy; I, too, love that God.
O Nanak, through the Shabad, union is obtained; there is no more separation. ||8||5||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
You may chant and meditate, practice austerities and self-restraint, and dwell at sacred shrines of pilgrimage;
you may give donations to charity, and perform good deeds, but without the True One, what is the use of it all?
As you plant, so shall you harvest. Without virtue, this human life passes away in vain. ||1||
O young bride, be a slave to virtue, and you shall find peace.
Renouncing wrongful actions, following the Guru's Teachings, you shall be absorbed into the Perfect One. ||1||Pause||
Without capital, the trader looks around in all four directions.
He does not understand his own origins; the merchandise remains within the door of his own house.
Without this commodity, there is great pain. The false are ruined by falsehood. ||2||
One who contemplates and appraises this Jewel day and night reaps new profits.
He finds the merchandise within his own home, and departs after arranging his affairs.
So trade with the true traders, and as Gurmukh, contemplate God. ||3||
In the Society of the Saints, He is found, if the Uniter unites us.
One whose heart is filled with His Infinite Light meets with Him, and shall never again be separated from Him.
True is his position; he abides in Truth, with love and affection for the True One. ||4||
One who understands himself finds the Mansion of the Lord's Presence within his own home.
Imbued with the True Lord, Truth is gathered in.
