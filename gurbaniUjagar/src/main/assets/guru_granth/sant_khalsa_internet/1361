The Beloved Eternal Lord God,
O Nanak, carries us across the world-ocean. ||14||
It is death to forget the Lord of the Universe.
It is life to meditate on the Name of the Lord.
The Lord is found in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy,
O Nanak, by pre-ordained destiny. ||15||
The snake-charmer, by his spell, neutralizes the poison and leaves the snake without fangs.
Just so, the Saints remove suffering;
O Nanak, they are found by good karma. ||16||
The Lord is All-pervading everywhere; He gives Sanctuary to all living beings.
The mind is touched by His Love, O Nanak,
by Guru's Grace, and the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. ||17||
My mind is pierced through by the Lord's Lotus Feet.
I am blessed with total happiness.
Holy people have been singing this Gaat'haa, O Nanak, since the very beginning of time. ||18||
Chanting and singing the Sublime Word of God in the Saadh Sangat,
mortals are saved from the world-ocean. O Nanak, they shall never again be consigned to reincarnation. ||19||
People contemplate the Vedas, Puraanas and Shaastras.
But by enshrining in their hearts the Naam, the Name of the One and Only Creator of the Universe,
everyone can be saved.
By great good fortune, O Nanak, a few cross over like this. ||20||
Meditating in remembrance on the Naam, the Name of Lord of the Universe, all one's generations are saved.
It is obtained in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. O Nanak, by great good fortune, the Blessed Vision of His Darshan is seen. ||21||
Abandon all your evil habits, and implant all Dharmic faith within.
The Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is obtained, O Nanak, by those who have such destiny written upon their foreheads. ||22||
God was, is, and shall always be. He sustains and destroys all.
Know that these Holy people are true, O Nanak; they are in love with the Lord. ||23||
The mortal is engrossed in sweet words and transitory pleasures which shall soon fade away.
Disease, sorrow and separation afflict him; O Nanak, he never finds peace, even in dreams. ||24||
Phunhay, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
With Pen in Hand, the Unfathomable Lord writes the mortal's destiny upon his forehead.
The Incomparably Beautiful Lord is involved with all.
I cannot utter Your Praises with my mouth.
Nanak is fascinated, gazing upon the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. I am a sacrifice to You. ||1||
Seated in the Society of the Saints, I chant the Lord's Praises.
I dedicate all my adornments to Him, and give all this soul to Him.
With hopeful yearning for Him, I have made the bed for my Husband.
O Lord! If such good destiny is inscribed upon my forehead, then I shall find my Friend. ||2||
O my companion, I have prepared everything: make-up, garlands and betel-leaves.
I have embellished myself with the sixteen decorations, and applied the mascara to my eyes.
If my Husband Lord comes to my home, then I obtain everything.
O Lord! Without my Husband, all these adornments are useless. ||3||
Very fortunate is she, within whose home the Husband Lord abides.
She is totally adorned and decorated; she is a happy soul-bride.
I sleep in peace, without anxiety; the hopes of my mind have been fulfilled.
O Lord! When my Husband came into the home of my heart, I obtained everything. ||4||
