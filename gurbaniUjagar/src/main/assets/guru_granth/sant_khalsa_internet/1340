The Word of the Guru's Shabad is unchanging, forever and ever.
Whose minds are filled with the Word of the Guru's Bani,
all pains and afflictions run away from him. ||1||
Imbued with the Lord's Love, they sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
They are liberated, bathing in the dust of the feet of the Holy. ||1||Pause||
By Guru's Grace, they are carried across to the other shore;
they are rid of fear, doubt and corruption.
The Guru's Feet abide deep within their minds and bodies.
The Holy are fearless; they take to the Sanctuary of the Lord. ||2||
They are blessed with abundant bliss, happiness, pleasure and peace.
Enemies and pains do not even approach them.
The Perfect Guru makes them His Own, and protects them.
Chanting the Lord's Name, they are rid of all their sins. ||3||
The Saints, spiritual companions and Sikhs are exalted and uplifted.
The Perfect Guru leads them to meet God.
The painful noose of death and rebirth is snapped.
Says Nanak, the Guru covers their faults. ||4||8||
Prabhaatee, Fifth Mehl:
The Perfect True Guru has bestowed the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
I am blessed with bliss and happiness, emancipation and eternal peace. All my affairs have been resolved. ||1||Pause||
The Lotus Feet of the Guru abide within my mind.
I am rid of pain, suffering, doubt and fraud. ||1||
Rise early, and sing the Glorious Word of God's Bani.
Twenty-four hours a day, meditate in remembrance on the Lord, O mortal. ||2||
Inwardly and outwardly, God is everywhere.
Wherever I go, He is always with me, my Helper and Support. ||3||
With my palms pressed together, I offer this prayer.
O Nanak, I meditate forever on the Lord, the Treasure of Virtue. ||4||9||
Prabhaatee, Fifth Mehl:
The Supreme Lord God is All-wise and All-knowing.
The Perfect Guru is found by great good fortune. I am a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. ||1||Pause||
My sins are cut away, through the Word of the Shabad, and I have found contentment.
I have become worthy of worshipping the Naam in adoration.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I have been enlightened.
The Lord's Lotus Feet abide within my mind. ||1||
The One who made us, protects and preserves us.
God is Perfect, the Master of the masterless.
Those, upon whom He showers His Mercy
- they have perfect karma and conduct. ||2||
They sing the Glories of God, continually, continuously, forever fresh and new.
They do not wander in the 8.4 million incarnations.
Here and hereafter, they worship the Lord's Feet.
Their faces are radiant, and they are honored in the Court of the Lord. ||3||
That person, upon whose forehead the Guru places His Hand
NAME?
He sees God pervading and permeating the water, the land and the sky.
Nanak is saved by the dust of the feet of such a humble being. ||4||10||
Prabhaatee, Fifth Mehl:
I am a sacrifice to my Perfect Guru.
By His Grace, I chant and meditate on the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||Pause||
Listening to the Ambrosial Word of His Bani, I am exalted and enraptured.
My corrupt and poisonous entanglements are gone. ||1||
I am in love with the True Word of His Shabad.
The Lord God has come into my consciousness. ||2||
Chanting the Naam, I am enlightened.
