Those who do not have the Assets of Truth-how can they find peace?
By dealing their deals of falsehood, their minds and bodies become false.
Like the deer caught in the trap, they suffer in terrible agony; they continually cry out in pain. ||2||
The counterfeit coins are not put into the Treasury; they do not obtain the Blessed Vision of the Lord-Guru.
The false ones have no social status or honor. No one succeeds through falsehood.
Practicing falsehood again and again, people come and go in reincarnation, and forfeit their honor. ||3||
O Nanak, instruct your mind through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and praise the Lord.
Those who are imbued with the love of the Name of the Lord are not loaded down by doubt.
Those who chant the Name of the Lord earn great profits; the Fearless Lord abides within their minds. ||4||23||
Siree Raag, First Mehl, Second House:
Wealth, the beauty of youth and flowers are guests for only a few days.
Like the leaves of the water-lily, they wither and fade and finally die. ||1||
Be happy, dear beloved, as long as your youth is fresh and delightful.
But your days are few-you have grown weary, and now your body has grown old. ||1||Pause||
My playful friends have gone to sleep in the graveyard.
In my double-mindedness, I shall have to go as well. I cry in a feeble voice. ||2||
Haven't you heard the call from beyond, O beautiful soul-bride?
You must go to your in-laws; you cannot stay with your parents forever. ||3||
O Nanak, know that she who sleeps in her parents' home is plundered in broad daylight.
She has lost her bouquet of merits; gathering one of demerits, she departs. ||4||24||
Siree Raag, First Mehl, Second House:
He Himself is the Enjoyer, and He Himself is the Enjoyment. He Himself is the Ravisher of all.
He Himself is the Bride in her dress, He Himself is the Bridegroom on the bed. ||1||
My Lord and Master is imbued with love; He is totally permeating and pervading all. ||1||Pause||
He Himself is the fisherman and the fish; He Himself is the water and the net.
He Himself is the sinker, and He Himself is the bait. ||2||
He Himself loves in so many ways. O sister soul-brides, He is my Beloved.
He continually ravishes and enjoys the happy soul-brides; just look at the plight I am in without Him! ||3||
Prays Nanak, please hear my prayer: You are the pool, and You are the soul-swan.
You are the lotus flower of the day and You are the water-lily of the night. You Yourself behold them, and blossom forth in bliss. ||4||25||
Siree Raag, First Mehl, Third House:
Make this body the field, and plant the seed of good actions. Water it with the Name of the Lord, who holds all the world in His Hands.
Let your mind be the farmer; the Lord shall sprout in your heart, and you shall attain the state of Nirvaanaa. ||1||
You fool! Why are you so proud of Maya?
Father, children, spouse, mother and all relatives-they shall not be your helpers in the end. ||Pause||
So weed out evil, wickedness and corruption; leave these behind, and let your soul meditate on God.
When chanting, austere meditation and self-discipline become your protectors, then the lotus blossoms forth, and the honey trickles out. ||2||
Bring the twenty-seven elements of the body under your control, and throughout the three stages of life, remember death.
See the Infinite Lord in the ten directions, and in all the variety of nature. Says Nanak, in this way, the One Lord shall carry you across. ||3||26||
