Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
Even in a forest fire, some trees remain green.
The infant is released from the pain of the mother's womb.
Meditating in remembrance on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, fear is dispelled.
Just so, the Sovereign Lord protects and saves the Saints. ||1||
Such is the Merciful Lord, my Protector.
Wherever I look, I see You cherishing and nurturing. ||1||Pause||
As thirst is quenched by drinking water;
as the bride blossoms forth when her husband comes home;
as wealth is the support of the greedy person -
just so, the humble servant of the Lord loves the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||2||
As the farmer protects his fields;
as the mother and father show compassion to their child;
as the lover merges on seeing the beloved;
just so does the Lord hug His humble servant close in His Embrace. ||3||
As the blind man is in ecstasy, when he can see again;
and the mute, when he is able to speak and sing songs;
and the cripple, being able to climb over the mountain -
just so, the Name of the Lord saves all. ||4||
As cold is dispelled by fire,
sins are driven out in the Society of the Saints.
As cloth is cleaned by soap,
just so, by chanting the Naam, all doubts and fears are dispelled. ||5||
As the chakvi bird longs for the sun,
as the rainbird thirsts for the rain drop,
as the deer's ears are attuned to the sound of the bell,
the Lord's Name is pleasing to the mind of the Lord's humble servant. ||6||
