Chant the Name of the Lord, O Sikhs of the Guru, O my Siblings of Destiny. Only the Lord will carry you across the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||Pause||
That humble being who worships, adores and serves the Guru is pleasing to my Lord God.
To worship and adore the True Guru is to serve the Lord. In His Mercy, He saves us and carries us across. ||2||
The ignorant and the blind wander deluded by doubt; deluded and confused, they pick flowers to offer to their idols.
They worship lifeless stones and serve the tombs of the dead; all their efforts are useless. ||3||
He alone is said to be the True Guru, who realizes God, and proclaims the Sermon of the Lord, Har, Har.
Offer the Guru sacred foods, clothes, silk and satin robes of all sorts; know that He is True. The merits of this shall never leave you lacking. ||4||
The Divine True Guru is the Embodiment, the Image of the Lord; He utters the Ambrosial Word.
O Nanak, blessed and good is the destiny of that humble being, who focuses his consciousness on the Feet of the Lord. ||5||4||
Malaar, Fourth Mehl:
Those whose hearts are filled with my True Guru - those Saints are good and noble in every way.
Seeing them, my mind blossoms forth in bliss; I am forever a sacrifice to them. ||1||
O spiritual teacher, chant the Name of the Lord, day and night.
All hunger and thirst are satisfied, for those who partake of the sublime essence of the Lord, through the Guru's Teachings. ||1||Pause||
The slaves of the Lord are our Holy companions. Meeting with them, doubt is taken away.
As the swan separates the milk from the water, the Holy Saint removes the fire of egotism from the body. ||2||
Those who do not love the Lord in their hearts are deceitful; they continually practice deception.
What can anyone give them to eat? Whatever they themselves plant, they must eat. ||3||
This is the Quality of the Lord, and of the Lord's humble servants as well; the Lord places His Own Essence within them.
Blessed, blessed, is Guru Nanak, who looks impartially on all; He crosses over and transcends both slander and praise. ||4||5||
Malaar, Fourth Mehl:
The Name of the Lord is inaccessible, unfathomable, exalted and sublime. It is chanted by the Lord's Grace.
By great good fortune, I have found the True Congregation, and in the Company of the Holy, I am carried across. ||1||
My mind is in ecstasy, night and day.
By Guru's Grace, I chant the Name of the Lord. Doubt and fear are gone from my mind. ||1||Pause||
Those who chant and meditate on the Lord - O Lord, in Your Mercy, please unite me with them.
Gazing upon them, I am at peace; the pain and disease of egotism are gone. ||2||
Those who meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord in their hearts - their lives become totally fruitful.
They themselves swim across, and carry the world across with them. Their ancestors and family cross over as well. ||3||
You Yourself created the whole world, and You Yourself keep it under Your control.
