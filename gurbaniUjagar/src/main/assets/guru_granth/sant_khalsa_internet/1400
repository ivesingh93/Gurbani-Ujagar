The All-powerful Guru is the Boat to carry us across in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga. Hearing the Word of His Shabad, we are transported into Samaadhi.
He is the Spiritual Hero who destroys pain and brings peace. Whoever meditates on Him, dwells near Him.
He is the Perfect Primal Being, who meditates in remembrance on the Lord within his heart; seeing His Face, sins run away.
If you long for wisdom, wealth, spiritual perfection and prosperity, O my mind, dwell upon the Guru, the Guru, the Guru. ||5||9||
Gazing upon the Face of the Guru, I find peace.
I was thirsty, yearning to drink in the Nectar; to fulfill that wish, the Guru laid out the way.
My mind has become perfect; it dwells in the Lord's Place; it had been wandering in all directions, in its desire for tastes and pleasures.
Goindwal is the City of God, built on the bank of the Beas River.
The pains of so many years have been taken away; gazing upon the Face of the Guru, I find peace. ||6||10||
The All-powerful Guru placed His hand upon my head.
The Guru was kind, and blessed me with the Lord's Name. Gazing upon His Feet, my sins were dispelled.
Night and day, the Guru meditates on the One Lord; hearing His Name, the Messenger of Death is scared away.
So speaks the Lord's slave: Guru Raam Daas placed His Faith in Guru Amar Daas, the Guru of the World; touching the Philosopher's Stone, He was transformed into the Philosopher's Stone.
Guru Raam Daas recognized the Lord as True; the All-powerful Guru placed His hand upon His head. ||7||11||
Now, please preserve the honor of Your humble slave.
God saved the honor of the devotee Prahlaad, when Harnaakhash tore him apart with his claws.
And the Dear Lord God saved the honor of Dropadi; when her clothes were stripped from her, she was blessed with even more.
Sudaamaa was saved from misfortune; and Ganikaa the prostitute - when she chanted Your Name, her affairs were perfectly resolved.
O Great True Guru, if it pleases You, please save the honor of Your slave in this Dark Age of kali Yuga. ||8||12||
Jholnaa:
Chant Guru, Guru, Guru, Guru, Guru, O mortal beings.
Chant the Shabad, the Word of the Lord, Har, Har; the Naam, the Name of the Lord, brings the nine treasures. With your tongue, taste it, day and night, and know it as true.
Then, you shall obtain His Love and Affection; become Gurmukh, and meditate on Him. Give up all other ways; vibrate and meditate on Him, O spiritual people.
Enshrine the Word of the Guru's Teachings within your heart, and overpower the five passions. Your life, and your generations, shall be saved, and you shall be honored at the Lord's Door.
If you desire all the peace and comforts of this world and the next, then chant Guru, Guru, Guru, Guru, Guru, O mortal beings. ||1||13||
Chant Guru, Guru, Guru, Guru, Guru, and know Him as true.
Know that the Lord is the Treasure of Excellence. Enshrine Him in your mind, and meditate on Him. Enshrine the Word of the Guru's Teachings within your heart.
Then, cleanse yourself in the Immaculate and Unfathomable Water of the Guru; O GurSikhs and Saints, cross over the Ocean of Love of the True Name.
Meditate lovingly forever on the Lord, free of hate and vengeance, Formless and Fearless; lovingly savor the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and implant devotional worship of the Lord deep within.
O foolish mind, give up your doubts; as Gurmukh, vibrate and meditate on the Naam. Chant Guru, Guru, Guru, Guru, Guru, and know Him as true. ||2||14||
