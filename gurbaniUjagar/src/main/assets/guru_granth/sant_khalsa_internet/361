The Guru's system is the way to liberation.
The True Lord Himself comes to dwell in the mind. ||1||Pause||
Through the Guru's system, the world is saved,
if it is embraced with love and affection.
How rare is that person who truly loves the Guru's Way.
Through the Guru's system, everlasting peace is obtained. ||2||
Through the Guru's system, the Door of Salvation is obtained.
Serving the True Guru, one's family is saved.
There is no salvation for those who have no Guru.
Beguiled by worthless sins, they are struck down. ||3||
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the body finds peace and tranquility.
The Gurmukh is not afflicted by pain.
The Messenger of Death does not come near him.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh is absorbed in the True Lord. ||4||1||40||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
One who dies in the Word of the Shabad, eradicates his self-conceit from within.
He serves the True Guru, with no iota of self-interest.
The Fearless Lord, the Great Giver, ever abides in his mind.
The True Bani of the Word is obtained only by good destiny. ||1||
So gather merits, and let your demerits depart from within you.
You shall be absorbed into the Shabad, the Word of the Perfect Guru. ||1||Pause||
One who purchases merits, knows the value of these merits.
He chants the Ambrosial Nectar of the Word, and the Name of the Lord.
Through the True Bani of the Word, he becomes pure.
Through merit, the Name is obtained. ||2||
The invaluable merits cannot be acquired.
The pure mind is absorbed into the True Word of the Shabad.
How very fortunate are those who meditate on the Naam,
and ever enshrine in their minds the Lord, the Giver of merit. ||3||
I am a sacrifice to those who gather merits.
At the Gate of Truth, I sing the Glorious Praises of the True One.
He Himself spontaneously bestows His gifts.
O Nanak, the value of the Lord cannot be described. ||4||2||41||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
Great is the greatness of the True Guru;
He merges in His Merger, those who have been separated for so long.
He Himself merges the merged in His Merger.
He Himself knows His own worth. ||1||
How can anyone appraise the Lord's worth?
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, one may merge with the Infinite, Unapproachable and Incomprehensible Lord. ||1||Pause||
Few are the Gurmukhs who know His worth.
How rare are those who receive the Lord's Grace.
Through the Sublime Bani of His Word, one becomes sublime.
The Gurmukh chants the Word of the Shabad. ||2||
Without the Name, the body suffers in pain;
but when one meets the True Guru, then that pain is removed.
Without meeting the Guru, the mortal earns only pain.
The self-willed manmukh receives only more punishment. ||3||
The essence of the Lord's Name is so very sweet;
he alone drinks it, whom the Lord causes to drink it.
By Guru's Grace, the essence of the Lord is obtained.
O Nanak, imbued with the Naam, the Name of the Lord, salvation is attained. ||4||3||42||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
My God is True, deep and profound.
Serving Him, the body acquires peace and tranquility.
Through the Word of the Shabad, His humble servants easily swim across.
I fall at their feet forever and ever. ||1||
Those being whose minds are imbued and drenched with the Lord's Love -
