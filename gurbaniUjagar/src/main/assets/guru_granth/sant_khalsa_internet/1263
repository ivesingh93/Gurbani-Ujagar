One who forgets such a Name of the Lord, Har, Har - his family is dishonored.
His family is sterile and barren, and his mother is made a widow. ||2||
O Lord, let me meet the Holy Guru, who night and day keep the Lord enshrined in his heart.
Seeing the Guru, the GurSikh blossoms forth, like the child seeing his mother. ||3||
The soul-bride and the Husband Lord live together as one, but the hard wall of egotism has come between them.
The Perfect Guru demolishes the wall of egotism; servant Nanak has met the Lord, the Lord of the World. ||4||1||
Malaar, Fourth Mehl:
The Ganges, the Jamunaa, the Godaavari and the Saraswati - these rivers strive for the dust of the feet of the Holy.
Overflowing with their filthy sins, the mortals take cleansing baths in them; the rivers' pollution is washed away by the dust of the feet of the Holy. ||1||
Instead of bathing at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage, take your cleansing bath in the Name.
When the dust of the feet of the Sat Sangat rises up into the eyes, all filthy evil-mindedness is removed. ||1||Pause||
Bhaageerat'h the penitent brought the Ganges down, and Shiva established Kaydaar.
Krishna grazed cows in Kaashi; through the humble servant of the Lord, these places became famous. ||2||
And all the sacred shrines of pilgrimage established by the gods, long for the dust of the feet of the Holy.
Meeting with the Lord's Saint, the Holy Guru, I apply the dust of His feet to my face. ||3||
And all the creatures of Your Universe, O my Lord and Master, long for the dust of the feet of the Holy.
O Nanak, one who has such destiny inscribed on his forehead, is blessed with the dust of the feet of the Holy; the Lord carries him across. ||4||2||
Malaar, Fourth Mehl:
The Lord seems sweet to that humble being who is blessed by the Grace of the Lord.
His hunger and pain are totally taken away; he chants the Glorious Praises of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||
Meditating on the Lord, Har, Har, Har, the mortal is emancipated.
One who listens to the Guru's Teachings and meditates on them, is carried across the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||Pause||
I am the slave of that humble being, who is blessed by the Grace of the Lord, Har, Har.
Meeting with the Lord's humble servant, peace is obtained; all the pollution and filth of evil-mindedness is washed away. ||2||
The humble servant of the Lord feels hunger only for the Lord. He is satisfied only when he chants the Lord's Glories.
The humble servant of the Lord is a fish in the Water of the Lord. Forgetting the Lord, he would dry up and die. ||3||
He alone knows this love, who enshrines it within his mind.
Servant Nanak gazes upon the Lord and is at peace; The hunger of his body is totally satisfied. ||4||3||
Malaar, Fourth Mehl:
All the beings and creatures which God has created - on their foreheads, He has written their destiny.
The Lord blesses His humble servant with glorious greatness. The Lord enjoins him to his tasks. ||1||
The True Guru implants the Naam, the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, within.
