Raag Gauree Poorbee, Baawan Akhree Of Kabeer Jee:
One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. By Guru's Grace:
Through these fifty-two letters, the three worlds and all things are described.
These letters shall perish; they cannot describe the Imperishable Lord. ||1||
Wherever there is speech, there are letters.
Where there is no speech, there, the mind rests on nothing.
He is in both speech and silence.
No one can know Him as He is. ||2||
If I come to know the Lord, what can I say; what good does it do to speak?
He is contained in the seed of the banyan-tree, and yet, His expanse spreads across the three worlds. ||3||
One who knows the Lord understands His mystery, and bit by bit, the mystery disappears.
Turning away from the world, one's mind is pierced through with this mystery, and one obtains the Indestructible, Impenetrable Lord. ||4||
The Muslim knows the Muslim way of life; the Hindu knows the Vedas and Puraanas.
To instruct their minds, people ought to study some sort of spiritual wisdom. ||5||
I know only the One, the Universal Creator, the Primal Being.
I do not believe in anyone whom the Lord writes and erases.
If someone knows the One, the Universal Creator,
he shall not perish, since he knows Him. ||6||
KAKKA: When the rays of Divine Light come into the heart-lotus,
the moon-light of Maya cannot enter the basket of the mind.
And if one obtains the subtle fragrance of that spiritual flower,
he cannot describe the indescribable; he could speak, but who would understand? ||7||
KHAKHA: The mind has entered this cave.
It does not leave this cave to wander in the ten directions.
Knowing their Lord and Master, people show compassion;
then, they become immortal, and attain the state of eternal dignity. ||8||
GAGGA: One who understands the Guru's Word
does not listen to anything else.
He remains like a hermit and does not go anywhere,
when he grasps the Ungraspable Lord and dwells in the sky of the Tenth Gate. ||9||
GHAGHA: He dwells in each and every heart.
Even when the body-pitcher bursts, he does not diminish.
When someone finds the Path to the Lord within his own heart,
why should he abandon that Path to follow some other path? ||10||
NGANGA: Restrain yourself, love the Lord, and dismiss your doubts.
Even if you do not see the Path, do not run away; this is the highest wisdom. ||11||
CHACHA: He painted the great picture of the world.
Forget this picture, and remember the Painter.
This wondrous painting is now the problem.
Forget this picture and focus your consciousness on the Painter. ||12||
CHHACHHA: The Sovereign Lord of the Universe is here with you.
Why are you so unhappy? Why don't you abandon your desires?
O my mind, each and every moment I try to instruct you,
but you forsake Him, and entangle yourself with others. ||13||
JAJJA: If someone burns his body while he is still alive,
and burns away the desires of his youth, then he finds the right way.
When he burns his desire for his own wealth, and that of others,
then he finds the Divine Light. ||14||
JHAJHA: You are entangled in the world, and you do not know how to get untangled.
