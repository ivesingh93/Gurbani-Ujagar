Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
He is immersed in the enjoyment of corrupt pleasures; engrossed in them, the blind fool does not understand. ||1||
I am earning profits, I am getting rich, he says, as his life passes away. ||Pause||
I am a hero, I am famous and distinguished; no one is equal to me. ||2||
I am young, cultured, and born of a good family. In his mind, he is proud and arrogant like this. ||3||
He is trapped by his false intellect, and he does not forget this until he dies. ||4||
Brothers, friends, relatives and companions who live after him - he entrusts his wealth to them. ||5||
That desire, to which the mind is attached, at the last moment, becomes manifest. ||6||
He may perform religious deeds, but his mind is egotistical, and he is bound by these bonds. ||7||
O Merciful Lord, please bless me Your Mercy, that Nanak may become the slave of Your slaves. ||8||3||15||44||Total||
One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. By Guru's Grace:
Raag Gauree Poorbee, Chhant, First Mehl:
For the bride, the night is painful; sleep does not come.
The soul-bride has grown weak, in the pain of separation from her Husband Lord.
The soul-bride is wasting away, in the pain of separation from her Husband; how can she see Him with her eyes?
Her decorations, sweet foods, sensuous pleasures and delicacies are all false; they are of no account at all.
Intoxicated with the wine of youthful pride, she has been ruined, and her breasts no longer yield milk.
O Nanak, the soul-bride meets her Husband Lord, when He causes her to meet Him; without Him, sleep does not come to her. ||1||
The bride is dishonored without her Beloved Husband Lord.
How can she find peace, without enshrining Him in her heart?
Without her Husband, her home is not worth living in; go and ask your sisters and companions.
Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, there is no love and affection; but with her True Lord, she abides in peace.
Through mental truthfulness and contentment, union with the True Friend is attained; through the Guru's Teachings, the Husband Lord is known.
O Nanak, that soul-bride who does not abandon the Naam, is intuitively absorbed in the Naam. ||2||
Come, O my sisters and companions - let's enjoy our Husband Lord.
I will ask the Guru, and write His Word as my love-note.
The Guru has shown me the True Word of the Shabad. The self-willed manmukhs will regret and repent.
My wandering mind became steady, when I recognized the True One.
The Teachings of Truth are forever new; the love of the Shabad is forever fresh.
O Nanak, through the Glance of Grace of the True Lord, celestial peace is obtained; let's meet Him, O my sisters and companions. ||3||
My desire has been fulfilled - my Friend has come to my home.
At the Union of husband and wife, the songs of rejoicing were sung.
Singing the songs of joyful praise and love to Him, the soul-bride's mind is thrilled and delighted.
My friends are happy, and my enemies are unhappy; meditating on the True Lord, the true profit is obtained.
With her palms pressed together, the soul-bride prays, that she may remain immersed in the Love of her Lord, night and day.
O Nanak, the Husband Lord and the soul-bride revel together; my desires are fulfilled. ||4||1||
