Meeting the Divine True Guru, I merge into the sound current of the Naad. ||1||Pause||
Where the dazzling white light is seen,
there the unstruck sound current of the Shabad resounds.
One's light merges in the Light;
by Guru's Grace, I know this. ||2||
The jewels are in the treasure chamber of the heart-lotus.
They sparkle and glitter like lightning.
The Lord is near at hand, not far away.
He is totally permeating and pervading in my soul. ||3||
Where the light of the undying sun shines,
the light of burning lamps seems insignificant.
By Guru's Grace, I know this.
Servant Naam Dayv is absorbed in the Celestial Lord. ||4||1||
Fourth House, Sorat'h:
The woman next door asked Naam Dayv, "Who built your house?
I shall pay him double wages. Tell me, who is your carpenter?" ||1||
O sister, I cannot give this carpenter to you.
Behold, my carpenter is pervading everywhere.
My carpenter is the Support of the breath of life. ||1||Pause||
This carpenter demands the wages of love, if someone wants Him to build their house.
When one breaks his ties with all the people and relatives, then the carpenter comes of His own accord. ||2||
I cannot describe such a carpenter, who is contained in everything, everywhere.
The mute tastes the most sublime ambrosial nectar, but if you ask him to describe it, he cannot. ||3||
Listen to the virtues of this carpenter, O sister; He stopped the oceans, and established Dhroo as the pole star.
Naam Dayv's Lord Master brought Sita back, and gave Sri Lanka to Bhabheekhan. ||4||2||
Sorat'h, Third House:
The skinless drum plays.
Without the rainy season, the clouds shake with thunder.
Without clouds, the rain falls,
if one contemplates the essence of reality. ||1||
I have met my Beloved Lord.
Meeting with Him, my body is made beauteous and sublime. ||1||Pause||
Touching the philosopher's stone, I have been transformed into gold.
I have threaded the jewels into my mouth and mind.
I love Him as my own, and my doubt has been dispelled.
Seeking the Guru's guidance, my mind is content. ||2||
The water is contained within the pitcher;
I know that the One Lord is contained in all.
The mind of the disciple has faith in the Guru.
Servant Naam Dayv understands the essence of reality. ||3||3||
Raag Sorat'h, The Word Of Devotee Ravi Daas Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
When I am in my ego, then You are not with me. Now that You are with me, there is no egotism within me.
The wind may raise up huge waves in the vast ocean, but they are just water in water. ||1||
O Lord, what can I say about such an illusion?
Things are not as they seem. ||1||Pause||
It is like the king, who falls asleep upon his throne, and dreams that he is a beggar.
His kingdom is intact, but separated from it, he suffers in sorrow. Such is my own condition. ||2||
