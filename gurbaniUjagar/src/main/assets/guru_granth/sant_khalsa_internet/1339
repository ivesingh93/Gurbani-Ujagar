Twenty-four hours a day, I meditate on the Supreme Lord God; I sing His Glorious Praises forever and ever.
Says Nanak, my desires have been fulfilled; I have found my Guru, the Supreme Lord God. ||4||4||

Meditating in remembrance on the Naam, all my sins have been erased.
The Guru has blessed me with the Capital of the True Name.
God's servants are embellished and exalted in His Court;
serving Him, they look beauteous forever. ||1||
Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my Siblings of Destiny.
All sickness and sin shall be erased; your mind shall be rid of the darkness of ignorance. ||1||Pause||
The Guru has saved me from death and rebirth, O friend;

whatever pleases Him is good. ||2||
I am forever a sacrifice to the Guru;
by His Grace, I meditate on the Lord's Name.
By great good fortune, such a Guru is found;
meeting Him, one is lovingly attuned to the Lord. ||3||
Please be merciful, O Supreme Lord God, O Lord and Master,
Inner-knower, Searcher of Hearts.
Twenty-four hours a day, I am lovingly attuned to You.

I have been saved, touching the Feet of the True Guru.
Whatever the Guru says is good and sweet to me. I have renounced the intellectual wisdom of my mind. ||1||Pause||
That Lord God abides within my mind and body.
There are no conflicts, pains or obstacles.
Forever and ever, God is with my soul.
Filth and pollution are washed away by the Love of the Name. ||2||
I am in love with the Lotus Feet of the Lord;
I am no longer consumed by sexual desire, anger and egotism.
Now, I know the way to meet God.
Through loving devotional worship, my mind is pleased and appeased with the Lord. ||3||
Listen, O friends, Saints, my exalted companions.

They earn the profit, and the congratulations pour in;
by the Grace of the Saints, they sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||2||
Their lives are fruitful and prosperous, and their birth is approved;
by Guru's Grace, they enjoy the Love of the Lord. ||3||

O Nanak, as Gurmukh, they are carried across to the other shore. ||4||7||

The Guru is Perfect, and Perfect is His Power.
