Those GurSikhs, with whom the Lord is pleased, accept the Word of the True Guru.
Those Gurmukhs who meditate on the Naam are imbued with the four-fold color of the Lord's Love. ||12||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
The self-willed manmukh is cowardly and ugly; lacking the Name of the Lord, his nose is cut off in disgrace.
Night and day, he is engrossed in worldly affairs, and even in his dreams, he finds no peace.
O Nanak, if he becomes Gurmukh, then he shall be saved; otherwise, he is held in bondage, and suffers in pain. ||1||
Third Mehl:
The Gurmukhs always look beautiful in the Court of the Lord; they practice the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
There is a lasting peace and happiness deep within them; at the Court of the True Lord, they receive honor.
O Nanak, the Gurmukhs are blessed with the Name of the Lord; they merge imperceptibly into the True Lord. ||2||
Pauree:
As Gurmukh, Prahlaad meditated on the Lord, and was saved.
As Gurmukh, Janak lovingly centered his consciousness on the Lord's Name.
As Gurmukh, Vashisht taught the Teachings of the Lord.
Without the Guru, no one has found the Lord's Name, O my Siblings of Destiny.
The Lord blesses the Gurmukh with devotion. ||13||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
One who has no faith in the True Guru, and who does not love the Word of the Shabad,
shall find no peace, even though he may come and go hundreds of times.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh meets the True Lord with natural ease; he is in love with the Lord. ||1||
Third Mehl:
O mind, search for such a True Guru, by serving whom the pains of birth and death are dispelled.
Doubt shall never afflict you, and your ego shall be burnt away through the Word of the Shabad.
The veil of falsehood shall be torn down from within you, and Truth shall come to dwell in the mind.
Peace and happiness shall fill your mind deep within, if you act according to truth and self-discipline.
O Nanak, by perfect good karma, you shall meet the True Guru, and then the Dear Lord, by His Sweet Will, shall bless you with His Mercy. ||2||
Pauree:
The whole world comes under the control of one whose home is filled with the Lord, the King.
He is subject to no one else's rule, and the Lord, the King, causes everyone to fall at his feet.
One may run away from the courts of other men, but where can one go to escape the Lord's Kingdom?
The Lord is such a King, who abides in the hearts of His devotees; He brings the others, and makes them stand before His devotees.
The glorious greatness of the Lord's Name is obtained only by His Grace; how few are the Gurmukhs who meditate on Him. ||14||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Without serving the True Guru, the people of the world are dead; they waste their lives away in vain.
In love with duality, they suffer terrible pain; they die, and are reincarnated, and continue coming and going.
They live in manure, and are reincarnated again and again.
O Nanak, without the Name, the Messenger of Death punishes them; in the end, they depart regretting and repenting. ||1||
Third Mehl:
In this world, there is one Husband Lord; all other beings are His brides.
