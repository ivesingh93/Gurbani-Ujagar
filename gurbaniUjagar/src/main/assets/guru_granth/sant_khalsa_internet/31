Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Discarding the Ambrosial Nectar, they greedily grab the poison; they serve others, instead of the Lord.
They lose their faith, they have no understanding; night and day, they suffer in pain.
The blind, self-willed manmukhs do not even think of the Lord; they are drowned to death without water. ||1||
O mind, vibrate and meditate forever on the Lord; seek the Protection of His Sanctuary.
If the Word of the Guru's Shabad abides deep within, then you shall not forget the Lord. ||1||Pause||
This body is the puppet of Maya. The evil of egotism is within it.
Coming and going through birth and death, the self-willed manmukhs lose their honor.
Serving the True Guru, eternal peace is obtained, and one's light merges into the Light. ||2||
Serving the True Guru brings a deep and profound peace, and one's desires are fulfilled.
Abstinence, truthfulness and self-discipline are obtained, and the body is purified; the Lord, Har, Har, comes to dwell within the mind.
Such a person remains blissful forever, day and night. Meeting the Beloved, peace is found. ||3||
I am a sacrifice to those who seek the Sanctuary of the True Guru.
In the Court of the True One, they are blessed with true greatness; they are intuitively absorbed into the True Lord.
O Nanak, by His Glance of Grace He is found; the Gurmukh is united in His Union. ||4||12||45||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
The self-willed manmukh performs religious rituals, like the unwanted bride decorating her body.
Her Husband Lord does not come to her bed; day after day, she grows more and more miserable.
She does not attain the Mansion of His Presence; she does not find the door to His House. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, meditate on the Naam with one-pointed mind.
Remain united with the Society of the Saints; chant the Name of the Lord, and find peace. ||1||Pause||
The Gurmukh is the happy and pure soul-bride forever. She keeps her Husband Lord enshrined within her heart.
Her speech is sweet, and her way of life is humble. She enjoys the Bed of her Husband Lord.
The happy and pure soul-bride is noble; she has infinite love for the Guru. ||2||
By perfect good fortune, one meets the True Guru, when one's destiny is awakened.
Suffering and doubt are cut out from within, and peace is obtained.
One who walks in harmony with the Guru's Will shall not suffer in pain. ||3||
The Amrit, the Ambrosial Nectar, is in the Guru's Will. With intuitive ease, it is obtained.
Those who are destined to have it, drink it in; their egotism is eradicated from within.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh meditates on the Naam, and is united with the True Lord. ||4||13||46||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
If you know that He is your Husband Lord, offer your body and mind to Him.
Behave like the happy and pure soul-bride.
With intuitive ease, you shall merge with the True Lord, and He shall bless you with true greatness. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, without the Guru, there is no devotional worship.
Without the Guru, devotion is not obtained, even though everyone may long for it. ||1||Pause||
The soul-bride in love with duality goes around the wheel of reincarnation, through 8.4 million incarnations.
Without the Guru, she finds no sleep, and she passes her life-night in pain.
Without the Shabad, she does not find her Husband Lord, and her life wastes away in vain. ||2||
