You hold back in fear, and are not approved by the Lord.
Why do you talk such nonsense, trying to convince others?
Stirring up arguments, you shall only obtain more arguments. ||15||
NYANYA: He dwells near you, deep within your heart; why do you leave Him and go far away?
I searched the whole world for Him, but I found Him near myself. ||16||
TATTA: It is such a difficult path, to find Him within your own heart.
Open the doors within, and enter the Mansion of His Presence.
Beholding the Immovable Lord, you shall not slip and go anywhere else.
You shall remain firmly attached to the Lord, and your heart will be happy. ||17||
T'HAT'HA: Keep yourself far away from this mirage.
With great difficulty, I have calmed my mind.
That cheater, who cheated and devoured the whole world -
I have cheated that cheater, and my mind is now at peace. ||18||
DADDA: When the Fear of God wells up, other fears depart.
Other fears are absorbed into that Fear.
When one rejects the Fear of God, then other fears cling to him.
But if he becomes fearless, the fears of his heart run away. ||19||
DHADHA: Why do you search in other directions?
Searching for Him like this, the breath of life runs out.
When I returned after climbing the mountain,
I found Him in the fortress - the fortress which He Himself made. ||20||
NANNA: The warrior who fights on the battle-field should keep up and press on.
He should not yield, and he should not retreat.
Blessed is the coming of one
who conquers the one and renounces the many. ||21||
TATTA: The impassable world-ocean cannot be crossed over;
the body remains embroiled in the three worlds.
But when the Lord of the three worlds enters into the body,
then one's essence merges with the essence of reality, and the True Lord is attained. ||22||
T'HAT'HA: He is Unfathomable; His depths cannot be fathomed.
He is Unfathomable; this body is impermanent, and unstable.
The mortal builds his dwelling upon this tiny space;
without any pillars, he wishes to support a mansion. ||23||
DADDA: Whatever is seen shall perish.
Contemplate the One who is unseen.
When the key is inserted in the Tenth Gate,
then the Blessed Vision of the Merciful Lord's Darshan is seen. ||24||
DHADHA: When one ascends from the lower realms of the earth to the higher realms of the heavens, then everything is resolved.
The Lord dwells in both the lower and higher worlds.
Leaving the earth, the soul ascends to the heavens;
then, the lower and higher join together, and peace is obtained. ||25||
NANNA: The days and nights go by; I am looking for the Lord.
Looking for Him, my eyes have become blood-shot.
After looking and looking, when He is finally found,
then the one who was looking merges into the One who was looked for. ||26||
PAPPA: He is limitless; His limits cannot be found.
I have attuned myself to the Supreme Light.
One who controls his five senses
rises above both sin and virtue. ||27||
FAFFA: Even without the flower, the fruit is produced.
One who looks at a slice of that fruit
and reflects on it, will not be consigned to reincarnation.
A slice of that fruit slices all bodies. ||28||
BABBA: When one drop blends with another drop,
then these drops cannot be separated again.
Become the Lord's slave, and hold tight to His meditation.
If you turn your thoughts to the Lord, the Lord will take care of you like a relative. ||29||
