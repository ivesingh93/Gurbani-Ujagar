One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Raag Siree Raag, First Mehl, First House:
If I had a palace made of pearls, inlaid with jewels,
scented with musk, saffron and sandalwood, a sheer delight to behold -
seeing this, I might go astray and forget You, and Your Name would not enter into my mind. ||1||
Without the Lord, my soul is scorched and burnt.
I consulted my Guru, and now I see that there is no other place at all. ||1||Pause||
If the floor of this palace was a mosaic of diamonds and rubies, and if my bed was encased with rubies,
and if heavenly beauties, their faces adorned with emeralds, tried to entice me with sensual gestures of love -
seeing these, I might go astray and forget You, and Your Name would not enter into my mind. ||2||
If I were to become a Siddha, and work miracles, summon wealth
and become invisible and visible at will, so that people would hold me in awe -
seeing these, I might go astray and forget You, and Your Name would not enter into my mind. ||3||
If I were to become an emperor and raise a huge army, and sit on a throne,
issuing commands and collecting taxes-O Nanak, all of this could pass away like a puff of wind.
Seeing these, I might go astray and forget You, and Your Name would not enter into my mind. ||4||1||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
If I could live for millions and millions of years, and if the air was my food and drink,
and if I lived in a cave and never saw either the sun or the moon, and if I never slept, even in dreams -
even so, I could not estimate Your Value. How can I describe the Greatness of Your Name? ||1||
The True Lord, the Formless One, is Himself in His Own Place.
I have heard, over and over again, and so I tell the tale; as it pleases You, Lord, please instill within me the yearning for You. ||1||Pause||
If I was slashed and cut into pieces, over and over again, and put into the mill and ground into flour,
burnt by fire and mixed with ashes -
even then, I could not estimate Your Value. How can I describe the Greatness of Your Name? ||2||
If I was a bird, soaring and flying through hundreds of heavens,
and if I was invisible, neither eating nor drinking anything -
even so, I could not estimate Your Value. How can I describe the Greatness of Your Name? ||3||
