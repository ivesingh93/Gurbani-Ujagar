They do not remember the Name of the Creator Lord.
They die, and are reborn, over and over, again and again. ||2||
Those whose guru is spiritually blind - their doubts are not dispelled.
Abandoning the Source of all, they have become attached to the love of duality.
Infected with poison, they are immersed in poison. ||3||
Believing Maya to be the source of all, they wander in doubt.
They have forgotten the Dear Lord, and they are in love with duality.
The supreme status is obtained only by those who are blessed with His Glance of Grace. ||4||
One who has Truth pervading within, radiates Truth outwardly as well.
The Truth does not remain hidden, even though one may try to hide it.
The spiritually wise know this intuitively. ||5||
The Gurmukhs keep their consciousness lovingly centered on the Lord.
Ego and Maya are burned away by the Word of the Shabad.
My True God unites them in His Union. ||6||
The True Guru, The Giver, preaches the Shabad.
He controls, and restrains, and holds still the wandering mind.
Understanding is obtained through the Perfect Guru. ||7||
The Creator Himself has created the universe; He Himself shall destroy it.
Without Him, there is no other at all.
O Nanak, how rare are those who, as Gurmukh, understand this! ||8||6||
Gauree, Third Mehl:
The Gurmukhs obtain the Naam, the Priceless Name of the Lord.
They serve the Name, and through the Name, they are absorbed in intuitive peace and poise.
With their tongues, they continually sing the Ambrosial Naam.
They obtain the Lord's Name; the Lord showers His Mercy upon them. ||1||
Night and day, within your heart, meditate on the Lord of the Universe.
The Gurmukhs obtain the supreme state of peace. ||1||Pause||
Peace comes to fill the hearts of those
who, as Gurmukh, sing of the True Lord, the treasure of excellence.
They become the constant slaves of the slaves of the Lord's slaves.
Within their households and families, they remain always detached. ||2||
How rare are those who, as Gurmukh, become Jivan Mukta - liberated while yet alive.
They alone obtain the supreme treasure.
Eradicating the three qualities, they become pure.
They are intuitively absorbed in the True Lord God. ||3||
Emotional attachment to family does not exist,
when the True Lord abides within the heart.
The mind of the Gurmukh is pierced through and held steady.
One who recognizes the Hukam of the Lord's Command understands the True Lord. ||4||
You are the Creator Lord - there is no other for me.
I serve You, and through You, I obtain honor.
God showers His Mercy, and I sing His Praises.
The light of the jewel of the Naam permeates the entire world. ||5||
To the Gurmukhs, the Word of God's Bani seems so sweet.
Deep within, their hearts blossom forth; night and day, they lovingly center themselves on the Lord.
The True Lord is intuitively obtained, by His Grace.
The True Guru is obtained by the destiny of perfect good fortune. ||6||
Egotism, possessiveness, evil-mindedness and suffering depart,
when the Lord's Name, the Ocean of Virtue, comes to dwell within the heart.
The intellect of the Gurmukhs is awakened, and they praise God,
when the Lord's Lotus Feet come to dwell within the heart. ||7||
They alone receive the Naam, unto whom it is given.
The Gurmukhs shed their ego, and merge with the Lord.
The True Name abides within their hearts.
O Nanak, they are intuitively absorbed in the True Lord. ||8||7||
Gauree, Third Mehl:
The mind has intuitively healed itself, through the Fear of God.
