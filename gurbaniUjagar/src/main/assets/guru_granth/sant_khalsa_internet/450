The Lord has given the treasure of His devotional worship to servant Nanak. ||2||
What Glorious Virtues of Yours can I describe, O Lord and Master? You are the most infinite of the infinite, O Lord King.
I praise the Lord's Name, day and night; this alone is my hope and support.
I am a fool, and I know nothing. How can I find Your limits?
Servant Nanak is the slave of the Lord, the water-carrier of the slaves of the Lord. ||3||
As it pleases You, You save me; I have come seeking Your Sanctuary, O God, O Lord King.
I am wandering around, ruining myself day and night; O Lord, please save my honor!
I am just a child; You, O Guru, are my father. Please give me understanding and instruction.
Servant Nanak is known as the Lord's slave; O Lord, please preserve his honor! ||4||10||17||
Aasaa, Fourth Mehl:
Those who have the blessed pre-ordained destiny of the Lord written on their foreheads, meet the True Guru, the Lord King.
The Guru removes the darkness of ignorance, and spiritual wisdom illuminates their hearts.
They find the wealth of the jewel of the Lord, and then, they do not wander any longer.
Servant Nanak meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and in meditation, he meets the Lord. ||1||
Those who have not kept the Lord's Name in their consciousness - why did they bother to come into the world, O Lord King?
It is so difficult to obtain this human incarnation, and without the Naam, it is all futile and useless.
Now, in this most fortunate season, he does not plant the seed of the Lord's Name; what will the hungry soul eat, in the world hereafter?
The self-willed manmukhs are born again and again. O Nanak, such is the Lord's Will. ||2||
You, O Lord, belong to all, and all belong to You. You created all, O Lord King.
Nothing is in anyone's hands; all walk as You cause them to walk.
They alone are united with You, O Beloved, whom You cause to be so united; they alone are pleasing to Your Mind.
Servant Nanak has met the True Guru, and through the Lord's Name, he has been carried across. ||3||
Some sing of the Lord, through musical Ragas and the sound current of the Naad, through the Vedas, and in so many ways. But the Lord, Har, Har, is not pleased by these, O Lord King.
Those who are filled with fraud and corruption within - what good does it do for them to cry out?
The Creator Lord knows everything, although they may try to hide their sins and the causes of their diseases.
O Nanak, those Gurmukhs whose hearts are pure, obtain the Lord, Har, Har, by devotional worship. ||4||11||18||
Aasaa, Fourth Mehl:
Those whose hearts are filled with the love of the Lord, Har, Har, are the wisest and most clever people, O Lord King.
Even if they misspeak outwardly, they are still very pleasing to the Lord.
The Lord's Saints have no other place. The Lord is the honor of the dishonored.
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the Royal Court for servant Nanak; the Lord's power is his only power. ||1||
Wherever my True Guru goes and sits, that place is beautiful, O Lord King.
The Guru's Sikhs seek out that place; they take the dust and apply it to their faces.
The works of the Guru's Sikhs, who meditate on the Lord's Name, are approved.
Those who worship the True Guru, O Nanak - the Lord causes them to be worshipped in turn. ||2||
The Guru's Sikh keeps the Love of the Lord, and the Name of the Lord, in his mind. He loves You, O Lord, O Lord King.
