Says Kabeer, my mind became enlightened, when I saw the sun rise. ||2||43||
Gauree Chaytee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
They do not listen to the Lord's Praises, and they do not sing the Lord's Glories,
but they try to bring down the sky with their talk. ||1||
What can anyone say to such people?
You should always be careful around those whom God has excluded from His devotional worship. ||1||Pause||
They do not offer even a handful of water,
while they slander the one who brought forth the Ganges. ||2||
Sitting down or standing up, their ways are crooked and evil.
They ruin themselves, and then they ruin others. ||3||
They know nothing except evil talk.
They would not even obey Brahma's orders. ||4||
They themselves are lost, and they mislead others as well.
They set their own temple on fire, and then they fall asleep within it. ||5||
They laugh at others, while they themselves are one-eyed.
Seeing them, Kabeer is embarrassed. ||6||1||44||
Raag Gauree Bairaagan, Kabeer Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
He does not honor his ancestors while they are alive, but he holds feasts in their honor after they have died.
Tell me, how can his poor ancestors receive what the crows and the dogs have eaten up? ||1||
If only someone would tell me what real happiness is!
Speaking of happiness and joy, the world is perishing. How can happiness be found? ||1||Pause||
Making gods and goddesses out of clay, people sacrifice living beings to them.
Such are your dead ancestors, who cannot ask for what they want. ||2||
You murder living beings and worship lifeless things; at your very last moment, you shall suffer in terrible pain.
You do not know the value of the Lord's Name; you shall drown in the terrifying world-ocean. ||3||
You worship gods and goddesses, but you do not know the Supreme Lord God.
Says Kabeer, you have not remembered the Lord who has no ancestors; you are clinging to your corrupt ways. ||4||1||45||
Gauree:
One who remains dead while yet alive, will live even after death; thus he merges into the Primal Void of the Absolute Lord.
Remaining pure in the midst of impurity, he will never again fall into the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||
O my Lord, this is the milk to be churned.
Through the Guru's Teachings, hold your mind steady and stable, and in this way, drink in the Ambrosial Nectar. ||1||Pause||
The Guru's arrow has pierced the hard core of this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, and the state of enlightenment has dawned.
In the darkness of Maya, I mistook the rope for the snake, but that is over, and now I dwell in the eternal home of the Lord. ||2||
Maya has drawn her bow without an arrow, and has pierced this world, O Siblings of Destiny.
The drowning person is blown around in the ten directions by the wind, but I hold tight to the string of the Lord's Love. ||3||
