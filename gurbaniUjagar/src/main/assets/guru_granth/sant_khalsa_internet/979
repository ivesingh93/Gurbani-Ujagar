The doors of doubt are thrown open, and I have met the Lord of the World; God's diamond has pierced the diamond of my mind.
Nanak blossoms forth in ecstasy, singing the Lord's Praises; my Lord and Master is the ocean of virtue. ||2||2||3||
Nat, Fifth Mehl:
He Himself saves His humble servant.
Twenty-four hours a day, He dwells with His humble servant; He never forgets him from His Mind. ||1||Pause||
The Lord does not look at his color or form; He does not consider the ancestry of His slave.
Granting His Grace, the Lord blesses him with His Name, and embellishes him with intuitive ease. ||1||
The ocean of fire is treacherous and difficult, but he is carried across.
Seeing, seeing Him, Nanak blossoms forth, over and over again, a sacrifice to Him. ||2||3||4||
Nat, Fifth Mehl:
One who chants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, within his mind -
millions of sins are erased in an instant, and pain is relieved. ||1||Pause||
Seeking and searching, I have become detached; I have found the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
Renouncing everything, I am lovingly focused on the One Lord. I grab hold of the feet of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||
Whoever chants His Name is liberated; whoever listens to it is saved, as is anyone who seeks His Sanctuary.
Meditating, meditating in remembrance on God the Lord and Master, says Nanak, I am in ecstasy! ||2||4||5||
Nat, Fifth Mehl:
I am in love with Your Lotus Feet.
O Lord, ocean of peace, please bless me with the supreme status. ||1||Pause||
He has inspired His humble servant to grasp the hem of His robe; his mind is pierced through with the intoxication of divine love.
Singing His Praises, love wells up within the devotee, and the trap of Maya is broken. ||1||
The Lord, the ocean of mercy, is all-pervading, permeating everywhere; I do not see any other at all.
He has united slave Nanak with Himself; His Love never diminishes. ||2||5||6||
Nat, Fifth Mehl:
O my mind, chant, and meditate on the Lord.
I shall never forget Him from my mind; twenty-four hours a day, I sing His Glorious Praises. ||1||Pause||
I take my daily cleansing bath in the dust of the feet of the Holy, and I am rid of all my sins.
The Lord, the ocean of mercy, is all-pervading, permeating everywhere; He is seen to be contained in each and every heart. ||1||
Hundreds of thousands and millions of meditations, austerities and worships are not equal to remembering the Lord in meditation.
With his palms pressed together, Nanak begs for this blessing, that he may become the slave of the slaves of Your slaves. ||2||6||7||
Nat, Fifth Mehl:
The treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is everything for me.
Granting His Grace, He has led me to join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; the True Guru has granted this gift. ||1||Pause||
Sing the Kirtan, the Praises of the Lord, the Giver of peace, the Destroyer of pain; He shall bless you with perfect spiritual wisdom.
Sexual desire, anger and greed shall be shattered and destroyed, and your foolish ego will be dispelled. ||1||
What Glorious Virtues of Yours should I chant? O God, You are the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.
I seek the Sanctuary of Your Lotus Feet, O Lord, ocean of peace; Nanak is forever a sacrifice to You. ||2||7||8||
