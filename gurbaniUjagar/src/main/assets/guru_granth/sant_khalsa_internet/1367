Kabeer, the fish is in the shallow water; the fisherman has cast his net.
You shall not escape this little pool; think about returning to the ocean. ||49||
Kabeer, do not leave the ocean, even if it is very salty.
If you poke around searching from puddle to puddle, no one will call you smart. ||50||
Kabeer, those who have no guru are washed away. No one can help them.
Be meek and humble; whatever happens is what the Creator Lord does. ||51||
Kabeer, even the dog of a devotee is good, while the mother of the faithless cynic is bad.
The dog hears the Praises of the Lord's Name, while the other is engaged in sin. ||52||
Kabeer, the deer is weak, and the pool is lush with green vegetation.
Thousands of hunters are chasing after the soul; how long can it escape death? ||53||
Kabeer, some make their homes on the banks of the Ganges, and drink pure water.
Without devotional worship of the Lord, they are not liberated. Kabeer proclaims this. ||54||
Kabeer, my mind has become immaculate, like the waters of the Ganges.
The Lord follows after me, calling, "Kabeer! Kabeer!" ||55||
Kabeer, turmeric is yelow, and lime is white.
You shall meet the Beloved Lord, only when both colors are lost. ||56||
Kabeer, turmeric has lost its yellow color, and no trace of lime's whiteness remains.
I am a sacrifice to this love, by which social class and status, color and ancestry are taken away. ||57||
Kabeer, the door of liberation is very narrow, less than the width of a mustard seed.
Your mind is larger than an elephant; how will it pass through? ||58||
Kabeer, if I meet such a True Guru, who mercifully blesses me with the gift,
then the door of liberation will open wide for me, and I will easily pass through. ||59||
Kabeer, I have no hut or hovel, no house or village.
I hope that the Lord will not ask who I am. I have no social status or name. ||60||
Kabeer, I long to die; let me die at the Lord's Door.
I hope that the Lord does not ask, "Who is this, lying at my door?" ||61||
Kabeer, I have not done anything; I shall not do anything; my body cannot do anything.
I do not know what the Lord has done, but the call has gone out: "Kabeer, Kabeer". ||62||
Kabeer, if someone utters the Name of the Lord even in dreams,
I would make my skin into shoes for his feet. ||63||
Kabeer, we are puppets of clay, but we take the name of mankind.
We are guests here for only a few days, but we take up so much space. ||64||
Kabeer, I have made myself into henna, and I grind myself into powder.
But You, O my Husband Lord, have not asked about me; You have never applied me to Your Feet. ||65||
Kabeer, that door, through which people never stop coming and going -
how can I leave such a door as that? ||66||
Kabeer, I was drowning, but the waves of virtue saved me in an instant.
