Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Keep the Word of the Guru's Shabad in your mind.
Meditating in remembrance on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, all anxiety is removed. ||1||
Without the Lord God, there is no one else at all.
He alone preserves and destroys. ||1||Pause||
Enshrine the Guru's Feet in your heart.
Meditate on Him and cross over the ocean of fire. ||2||
Focus your meditation on the Guru's Sublime Form.
Here and hereafter, you shall be honored. ||3||
Renouncing everything, I have come to the Guru's Sanctuary.
My anxieties are over - O Nanak, I have found peace. ||4||61||130||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Remembering Him in meditation, all pains are gone.
The jewel of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, comes to dwell in the mind. ||1||
O my mind, chant the Bani, the Hymns of the Lord of the Universe.
The Holy People chant the Lord's Name with their tongues. ||1||Pause||
Without the One Lord, there is no other at all.
By His Glance of Grace, eternal peace is obtained. ||2||
Make the One Lord your friend, intimate and companion.
Write in your mind the Word of the Lord, Har, Har. ||3||
The Lord Master is totally pervading everywhere.
Nanak sings the Praises of the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. ||4||62||131||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
The whole world is engrossed in fear.
Those who have the Naam, the Name of the Lord, as their Support, feel no fear. ||1||
Fear does not affect those who take to Your Sanctuary.
You do whatever You please. ||1||Pause||
In pleasure and in pain, the world is coming and going in reincarnation.
Those who are pleasing to God, find peace. ||2||
Maya pervades the awesome ocean of fire.
Those who have found the True Guru are calm and cool. ||3||
Please preserve me, O God, O Great Preserver!
Says Nanak, what a helpless creature I am! ||4||63||132||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
By Your Grace, I chant Your Name.
By Your Grace, I obtain a seat in Your Court. ||1||
Without You, O Supreme Lord God, there is no one.
By Your Grace, everlasting peace is obtained. ||1||Pause||
If You abide in the mind, we do not suffer in sorrow.
By Your Grace, doubt and fear run away. ||2||
O Supreme Lord God, Infinite Lord and Master,
You are the Inner-knower, the Searcher of all hearts. ||3||
I offer this prayer to the True Guru:
O Nanak, may I be blessed with the treasure of the True Name. ||4||64||133||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
As the husk is empty without the grain,
so is the mouth empty without the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||
O mortal, chant continually the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
Without the Naam, cursed is the body, which shall be taken back by Death. ||1||Pause||
Without the Naam, no one's face shows good fortune.
Without the Husband, where is the marriage? ||2||
Forgetting the Naam, and attached to other tastes,
no desires are fulfilled. ||3||
O God, grant Your Grace, and give me this gift.
Please, let Nanak chant Your Name, day and night. ||4||65||134||
