Raag Soohee, Fifth Mehl, Third House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Attachment to sex is an ocean of fire and pain.
By Your Grace, O Sublime Lord, please save me from it. ||1||
I seek the Sanctuary of the Lotus Feet of the Lord.
He is the Master of the meek, the Support of His devotees. ||1||Pause||
Master of the masterless, Patron of the forlorn, Eradicator of fear of His devotees.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the Messenger of Death cannot even touch them. ||2||
The Merciful, Incomparably Beautiful, Embodiment of Life.
Vibrating the Glorious Virtues of the Lord, the noose of the Messenger of Death is cut away. ||3||
One who constantly chants the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam with his tongue,
is not touched or affected by Maya, the embodiment of disease. ||4||
Chant and meditate on God, the Lord of the Universe, and all of your companions shall be carried across;
the five thieves will not even approach. ||5||
One who meditates on the One God in thought, word and deed -
that humble being receives the fruits of all rewards. ||6||
Showering His Mercy, God has made me His own;
He has blessed me with the unique and singular Naam, and the sublime essence of devotion. ||7||
In the beginning, in the middle, and in the end, He is God.
O Nanak, without Him, there is no other at all. ||8||1||2||

One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Gazing upon them, my mind is enraptured. How can I join them and be with them?
They are Saints and friends, good friends of my mind, who inspire me and help me tune in to God's Love.
My love for them shall never die; it shall never, ever be broken. ||1||
O Supreme Lord God, please grant me Your Grace, that I might constantly sing Your Glorious Praises.
Come, and meet with me, O Saints, and good friends; let us chant and meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the Best Friend of my mind. ||1||Pause||
He does not see, he does not hear, and he does not understand; he is blind, enticed and bewitched by Maya.
His body is false and transitory; it shall perish. And still, he entangles himself in false pursuits.
They alone depart victorious, who have meditated on the Naam; they stick with the Perfect Guru. ||2||
By the Hukam of God's Will, they come into this world, and they leave upon receipt of His Hukam.
By His Hukam, the Expanse of the Universe is expanded. By His Hukam, they enjoy pleasures.
One who forgets the Creator Lord, suffers sorrow and separation. ||3||
One who is pleasing to his God, goes to His Court dressed in robes of honor.
One who meditates on the Naam, the One Name, finds peace in this world; his face is radiant and bright.
The Supreme Lord confers honor and respect on those who serve the Guru with true love. ||4||
He is pervading and permeating the spaces and interspaces; He loves and cherishes all beings.
I have accumulated the true treasure, the wealth and riches of the One Name.
I shall never forget Him from my mind, since He has been so merciful to me. ||5||
