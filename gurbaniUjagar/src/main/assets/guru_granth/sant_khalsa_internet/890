In the third stage of life, he gathers the wealth of Maya.
And when he grows old, he must leave all this; he departs regretting and repenting. ||2||
After a very long time, one obtains this precious human body, so difficult to obtain.
Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, it is reduced to dust.
Worse than a beast, a demon or an idiot,
is that one who does not understand who created him. ||3||
Listen, O Creator Lord, Lord of the Universe, Lord of the World,
Merciful to the meek, forever compassionate -
If You emancipate the human, then his bonds are broken.
O Nanak, the people of world are blind; please, Lord, forgive them, and unite them with Yourself. ||4||12||23||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
Joining the elements together, the robe of the body is fashioned.
The ignorant fool is engrossed in it.
He cherishes it, and constantly takes care of it.
But at the very last moment, he must arise and depart. ||1||
Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, everything is false, O mortal.
Those who do not vibrate and meditate on the Lord of the Universe, but instead are imbued with other things, - all those mortals are plundered by Maya. ||1||Pause||
Bathing at sacred shrines of pilgrimage, filth is not washed off.
Religious rituals are all just egotistical displays.
By pleasing and appeasing people, no one is saved.
Without the Naam, they shall depart weeping. ||2||
Without the Lord's Name, the screen is not torn away.
I have studied all the Shaastras and Simritees.
He alone chants the Naam, whom the Lord Himself inspires to chant.
He obtains all fruits and rewards, and merges in peace. ||3||
O Savior Lord, please save me!
All peace and comforts are in Your Hand, God.
Whatever you attach me to, to that I am attached, O my Lord and Master.
O Nanak, the Lord is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. ||4||13||24||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
Whatever He does makes me happy.
The ignorant mind is encouraged, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
Now, it does not waver at all; it has become stable and steady.
Receiving Truth, it is merged in the True Lord. ||1||
Pain is gone, and all illness is gone.
I have accepted the Will of God in my mind, associating with the Great Person, the Guru. ||1||Pause||
All is pure; all is immaculate.
Whatever exists is good.
Wherever He keeps me, that is the place of liberation for me.
Whatever He makes me chant, is His Name. ||2||
That is the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage, where the Holy place their feet,
and that is heaven, where the Naam is chanted.
All bliss comes, when one obtains the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan.
I sing continuously, continually, the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||3||
The Lord Himself is pervading in each and every heart.
The glory of the Merciful Lord is radiant and manifest.
The shutters are opened, and doubts have run away.
Nanak has met with the Perfect Guru. ||4||14||25||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
Millions of meditations and austerities rest in him,
along with wealth, wisdom, miraculous spiritual powers and angelic spiritual insight.
He enjoys the various shows and forms, pleasures and delicacies;
the Naam, the Name of the Lord, dwells within the heart of the Gurmukh. ||1||
Such is the glorious greatness of the Name of the Lord.
Its value cannot be described. ||1||Pause||
He alone is brave, patient and perfectly wise;
