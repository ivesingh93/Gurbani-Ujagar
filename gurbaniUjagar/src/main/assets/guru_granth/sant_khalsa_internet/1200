With my ears, I listen to the Kirtan of His Praises, day and night. I love the Lord, Har, Har, with all my heart. ||3||
When the Guru helped me to overcome the five thieves, then I found ultimate bliss, attached to the Naam.
The Lord has showered His Mercy on servant Nanak; he merges in the Lord, in the Name of the Lord. ||4||5||
Saarang, Fourth Mehl:
O my mind, chant the Name of the Lord, and study His Excellence.
Without the Lord's Name, nothing is steady or stable. All the rest of the show is useless. ||1||Pause||
What is there to accept, and what is there to reject, O madman? Whatever is seen shall turn to dust.
That poison which you believe to be your own - you must abandon it and leave it behind. What a load you have to carry on your head! ||1||
Moment by moment, instant by instant, your life is running out. The fool cannot understand this.
He does things which will not go along with him in the end. This is the lifestyle of the faithless cynic. ||2||
So join together with the humble Saints, O madman, and you shall find the Gate of Salvation.
Without the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, no one finds any peace. Go and ask the scholars of the Vedas. ||3||
All the kings and queens shall depart; they must leave this false expanse.
O Nanak, the Saints are eternally steady and stable; they take the Support of the Name of the Lord. ||4||6||
Saarang, Fourth Mehl, Third House, Du-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O son, why do you argue with your father?
It is a sin to argue with the one who fathered you and raised you. ||1||Pause||
That wealth, which you are so proud of - that wealth does not belong to anyone.
In an instant, you shall have to leave behind all your corrupt pleasures; you shall be left to regret and repent. ||1||
He is God, your Lord and Master - chant the Chant of that Lord.
Servant Nanak spreads the Teachings; if you listen to it, you shall be rid of your pain. ||2||1||7||
Saarang, Fourth Mehl, Fifth House, Du-Padas, Partaal:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O my mind, meditate on the Lord of the World, the Master of the Universe, the Life of the World, the Enticer of the mind; fall in love with Him. I take the Support of the Lord, Har, Har, Har, all day and all night. ||1||Pause||
Endless, endless, endless are the Praises of the Lord. Suk Dayv, Naarad and the gods like Brahma sing His Glorious Praises. Your Glorious Virtues, O my Lord and Master, cannot even be counted.
O Lord, You are Infinite, O Lord, You are Infinite, O Lord, You are my Lord and Master; only You Yourself know Your Own Ways. ||1||
Those who are near, near to the Lord - those who dwell near the Lord - those humble servants of the Lord are the Holy, the devotees of the Lord.
Those humble servants of the Lord merge with their Lord, O Nanak, like water merging with water. ||2||1||8||
