Gauree Bairaagan, Fourth Mehl:
Just as the mother, having given birth to a son, feeds him and keeps him in her vision -
indoors and outdoors, she puts food in his mouth; each and every moment, she caresses him.
In just the same way, the True Guru protects His GurSikhs, who love their Beloved Lord. ||1||
O my Lord, we are just the ignorant children of our Lord God.
Hail, hail, to the Guru, the Guru, the True Guru, the Divine Teacher who has made me wise through the Lord's Teachings. ||1||Pause||
The white flamingo circles through the sky,
but she keeps her young ones in her mind; she has left them behind, but she constantly remembers them in her heart.
In just the same way, the True Guru loves His Sikhs. The Lord cherishes His GurSikhs, and keeps them clasped to His Heart. ||2||
Just as the tongue, made of flesh and blood, is protected within the scissors of the thirty-two teeth -
who thinks that the power lies in the flesh or the scissors? Everything is in the Power of the Lord.
In just the same way, when someone slanders the Saint, the Lord preserves the honor of His servant. ||3||
O Siblings of Destiny, let none think that they have any power. All act as the Lord causes them to act.
Old age, death, fever, poisons and snakes - everything is in the Hands of the Lord. Nothing can touch anyone without the Lord's Order.
Within your conscious mind, O servant Nanak, meditate forever on the Name of the Lord, who shall deliver you in the end. ||4||7||13||51||
Gauree Bairaagan, Fourth Mehl:
Meeting Him, the mind is filled with bliss. He is called the True Guru.
Double-mindedness departs, and the supreme status of the Lord is obtained. ||1||
How can I meet my Beloved True Guru?
Each and every moment, I humbly bow to Him. How will I meet my Perfect Guru? ||1||Pause||
Granting His Grace, the Lord has led me to meet my Perfect True Guru.
The desire of His humble servant has been fulfilled. I have received the dust of the Feet of the True Guru. ||2||
Those who meet the True Guru implant devotional worship to the Lord, and listen to this devotional worship of the Lord.
They never suffer any loss; they continually earn the profit of the Lord. ||3||
One whose heart blossoms forth, is not in love with duality.
O Nanak, meeting the Guru, one is saved, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||4||8||14||52||
Fourth Mehl, Gauree Poorbee:
The Merciful Lord God showered me with His Mercy; with mind and body and mouth, I chant the Lord's Name.
As Gurmukh, I have been dyed in the deep and lasting color of the Lord's Love. The robe of my body is drenched with His Love. ||1||
I am the maid-servant of my Lord God.
When my mind surrendered to the Lord, He made all the world my slave. ||1||Pause||
Consider this well, O Saints, O Siblings of Destiny - search your own hearts, seek and find Him there.
The Beauty and the Light of the Lord, Har, Har, is present in all. In all places, the Lord dwells near by, close at hand. ||2||
