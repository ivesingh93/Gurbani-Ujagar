Sorat'h, First Mehl, First House, Chau-Padas:
Death comes to all, and all must suffer separation.
Go and ask the clever people, whether they shall meet in the world hereafter.
Those who forget my Lord and Master shall suffer in terrible pain. ||1||
So praise the True Lord,
by whose Grace peace ever prevails. ||Pause||
Praise Him as great; He is, and He shall ever be.
You alone are the Great Giver; mankind cannot give anything.
Whatever pleases Him, comes to pass; what good does it do to cry out in protest? ||2||
Many have proclaimed their sovereignty over millions of fortresses on the earth, but they have now departed.
And those, whom even the sky could not contain, had ropes put through their noses.
O mind, if you only knew the torment in your future, you would not relish the sweet pleasures of the present. ||3||
O Nanak, as many as are the sins one commits, so many are the chains around his neck.
If he possesses virtues, then the chains are cut away; these virtues are his brothers, his true brothers.
Going to the world hereafter, those who have no Guru are not accepted; they are beaten, and expelled. ||4||1||
Sorat'h, First Mehl, First House:
Make your mind the farmer, good deeds the farm, modesty the water, and your body the field.
Let the Lord's Name be the seed, contentment the plow, and your humble dress the fence.
Doing deeds of love, the seed shall sprout, and you shall see your home flourish. ||1||
O Baba, the wealth of Maya does not go with anyone.
This Maya has bewitched the world, but only a rare few understand this. ||Pause||
Make your ever-decreasing life your shop, and make the Lord's Name your merchandise.
Make understanding and contemplation your warehouse, and in that warehouse, store the Lord's Name.
Deal with the Lord's dealers, earn your profits, and rejoice in your mind. ||2||
Let your trade be listening to scripture, and let Truth be the horses you take to sell.
Gather up merits for your travelling expenses, and do not think of tomorrow in your mind.
When you arrive in the land of the Formless Lord, you shall find peace in the Mansion of His Presence. ||3||
Let your service be the focusing of your consciousness, and let your occupation be the placing of faith in the Naam.
