If the Lord were totally pleased, then He would let Naam Dayv be His servant. ||3||1||
The tidal waves of greed constantly assault me.
My body is drowning, O Lord. ||1||
Please carry me across the world-ocean, O Lord of the Universe.
Carry me across, O Beloved Father. ||1||Pause||
I cannot steer my ship in this storm.
I cannot find the other shore, O Beloved Lord. ||2||
Please be merciful, and unite me with the True Guru;
carry me across, O Lord. ||3||
Says Naam Dayv, I do not know how to swim.
Give me Your Arm, give me Your Arm, O Beloved Lord. ||4||2||
Slowly at first, the body-cart loaded with dust starts to move.
Later, it is driven on by the stick. ||1||
The body moves along like the ball of dung, driven on by the dung-beetle.
The beloved soul goes down to the pool to wash itself clean. ||1||Pause||
The washer-man washes, imbued with the Lord's Love.
My mind is imbued with the Lord's Lotus Feet. ||2||
Prays Naam Dayv, O Lord, You are All-pervading.
Please be kind to Your devotee. ||3||3||
Basant, The Word Of Ravi Daas Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
You know nothing.
Seeing your clothes, you are so proud of yourself.
The proud bride shall not find a place with the Lord.
Above your head, the crow of death is cawing. ||1||
Why are you so proud? You are insane.
Even the mushrooms of summer live longer than you. ||1||Pause||
The deer does not know the secret;
the musk is within its own body, but it searches for it outside.
Whoever reflects on his own body-
the Messenger of Death does not abuse him. ||2||
The man is so proud of his sons and his wife;
his Lord and Master shall call for his account.
The soul suffers in pain for the actions it has committed.
Afterwards, whom shall you call, "Dear, Dear."||3||
If you seek the Support of the Holy,
millions upon millions of your sins shall be totally erased.
Says Ravi Daas, one who chants the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
is not concerned with social class, birth and rebirth. ||4||1||
Basant, Kabeer Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
You walk like a cow.
The hair on your tail is shiny and lustrous. ||1||
Look around, and eat anything in this house.
But do not go out to any other. ||1||Pause||
You lick the grinding bowl, and eat the flour.
Where have you taken the kitchen rags? ||2||
Your gaze is fixed on the basket in the cupboard.
Watch out - a stick may strike you from behind. ||3||
Says Kabeer, you have over-indulged in your pleasures.
Watch out - someone may throw a brick at you. ||4||1||
