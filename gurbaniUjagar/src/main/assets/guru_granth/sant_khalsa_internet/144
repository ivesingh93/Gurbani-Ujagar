You alone, Lord, You alone. ||2||
First Mehl:
Neither the just, nor the generous, nor any humans at all,
nor the seven realms beneath the earth, shall remain.
The One Lord alone exists. Who else is there?
You alone, Lord, You alone. ||3||
First Mehl:
Neither the sun, nor the moon, nor the planets,
nor the seven continents, nor the oceans,
nor food, nor the wind - nothing is permanent.
You alone, Lord, You alone. ||4||
First Mehl:
Our sustenance is not in the hands of any person.
The hopes of all rest in the One Lord.
The One Lord alone exists-who else is there?
You alone, Lord, You alone. ||5||
First Mehl:
The birds have no money in their pockets.
They place their hopes on trees and water.
He alone is the Giver.
You alone, Lord, You alone. ||6||
First Mehl:
O Nanak, that destiny which is pre-ordained and written on one's forehead -
no one can erase it.
The Lord infuses strength, and He takes it away again.
You alone, O Lord, You alone. ||7||
Pauree:
True is the Hukam of Your Command. To the Gurmukh, it is known.
Through the Guru's Teachings, selfishness and conceit are eradicated, and the Truth is realized.
True is Your Court. It is proclaimed and revealed through the Word of the Shabad.
Meditating deeply on the True Word of the Shabad, I have merged into the Truth.
The self-willed manmukhs are always false; they are deluded by doubt.
They dwell in manure, and they do not know the taste of the Name.
Without the Name, they suffer the agonies of coming and going.
O Nanak, the Lord Himself is the Appraiser, who distinguishes the counterfeit from the genuine. ||13||
Shalok, First Mehl:
Tigers, hawks, falcons and eagles-the Lord could make them eat grass.
And those animals which eat grass-He could make them eat meat. He could make them follow this way of life.
He could raise dry land from the rivers, and turn the deserts into bottomless oceans.
He could appoint a worm as king, and reduce an army to ashes.
All beings and creatures live by breathing, but He could keep us alive, even without the breath.
O Nanak, as it pleases the True Lord, He gives us sustenance. ||1||
First Mehl:
Some eat meat, while others eat grass.
Some have all the thirty-six varieties of delicacies,
while others live in the dirt and eat mud.
Some control the breath, and regulate their breathing.
Some live by the Support of the Naam, the Name of the Formless Lord.
The Great Giver lives; no one dies.
O Nanak, those who do not enshrine the Lord within their minds are deluded. ||2||
Pauree:
By the karma of good actions, some come to serve the Perfect Guru.
Through the Guru's Teachings, some eliminate selfishness and conceit, and meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Undertaking any other task, they waste their lives in vain.
Without the Name, all that they wear and eat is poison.
Praising the True Word of the Shabad, they merge with the True Lord.
Without serving the True Guru, they do not obtain the home of peace; they are consigned to reincarnation, over and over again.
Investing counterfeit capital, they earn only falsehood in the world.
O Nanak, singing the Praises of the Pure, True Lord, they depart with honor. ||14||
Shalok, First Mehl:
When it pleases You, we play music and sing; when it pleases You, we bathe in water.
