Glory is in His Hands; He bestows His Name, and attaches us to it.
O Nanak, the treasure of the Naam abides within the mind, and glory is obtained. ||8||4||26||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
Listen, O mortal: enshrine His Name within your mind; He shall come to meet with you, O my Sibling of Destiny.
Night and day, center your consciousness on true devotional worship of the True Lord. ||1||
Meditate on the One Naam, and you shall find peace, O my Siblings of Destiny.
Eradicate egotism and duality, and your glory shall be glorious. ||1||Pause||
The angels, humans and silent sages long for this devotional worship, but without the True Guru, it cannot be attained.
The Pandits, the religious scholars, and the astrologers read their books, but they do not understand. ||2||
He Himself keeps all in His Hand; nothing else can be said.
Whatever He gives, is received. The Guru has imparted this understanding to me. ||3||
All beings and creatures are His; He belongs to all.
So who can we call bad, since there is no other? ||4||
The Command of the One Lord is pervading throughout; duty to the One Lord is upon the heads of all.
He Himself has led them astray, and placed greed and corruption within their hearts. ||5||
He has sanctified those few Gurmukhs who understand Him, and reflect upon Him.
He grants devotional worship to them, and within them is the treasure. ||6||
The spiritual teachers know nothing but the Truth; they obtain true understanding.
They are led astray by Him, but they do not go astray, because they know the True Lord. ||7||
Within the homes of their bodies, the five passions are pervading, but here, the five are well-behaved.
O Nanak, without the True Guru, they are not overcome; through the Naam, the ego is conquered. ||8||5||27||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
Everything is within the home of your own self; there is nothing beyond it.
By Guru's Grace, it is obtained, and the doors of the inner heart are opened wide. ||1||
From the True Guru, the Lord's Name is obtained, O Siblings of Destiny.
The treasure of the Naam is within; the Perfect True Guru has shown this to me. ||1||Pause||
One who is a buyer of the Lord's Name, finds it, and obtains the jewel of contemplation.
He opens the doors deep within, and through the Eyes of Divine Vision, beholds the treasure of liberation. ||2||
There are so many mansions within the body; the soul dwells within them.
He obtains the fruits of his mind's desires, and he shall not have to go through reincarnation again. ||3||
The appraisers cherish the commodity of the Name; they obtain understanding from the Guru.
The wealth of the Naam is priceless; how few are the Gurmukhs who obtain it. ||4||
Searching outwardly, what can anyone find? The commodity is deep within the home of the self, O Siblings of Destiny.
The entire world is wandering around, deluded by doubt; the self-willed manmukhs lose their honor. ||5||
The false one leaves his own hearth and home, and goes out to another's home.
Like a thief, he is caught, and without the Naam, he is beaten and struck down. ||6||
Those who know their own home, are happy, O Siblings of Destiny.
They realize God within their own hearts, through the glorious greatness of the Guru. ||7||
He Himself gives gifts, and He Himself bestows understanding; unto whom can we complain?
O Nanak, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and you shall obtain glory in the True Court. ||8||6||28||
