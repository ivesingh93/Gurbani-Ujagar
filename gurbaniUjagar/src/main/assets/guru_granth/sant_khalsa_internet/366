My mind and body are filled with divine love, and great sadness.
By great good fortune, I have obtained the True Guru, the Primal Being. ||2||

Aasaa, Fourth Mehl:
The Love of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the Support of my mind and body.
I chant the Naam; the Naam is the essence of peace. ||1||
So chant the Naam, O my friends and companions.
Without the Naam, there is nothing else for me. By great good fortune, as Gurmukh, I have received the Lord's Name. ||1||Pause||
Without the Naam, I cannot live.
By great good fortune, the Gurmukhs obtain the Naam. ||2||
Those who lack the Naam have their faces rubbed in the dirt of Maya.
Without the Naam, cursed, cursed are their lives. ||3||
The Great Lord is obtained by great good destiny.
