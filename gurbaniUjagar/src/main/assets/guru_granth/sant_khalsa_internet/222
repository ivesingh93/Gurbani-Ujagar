Their bodies and minds are purified, as they enshrine the True Lord in their consciousness.
O Nanak, meditate on the Lord, each and every day. ||8||2||
Gauree Gwaarayree, First Mehl:
The mind does not die, so the job is not accomplished.
The mind is under the power of the demons of evil intellect and duality.
But when the mind surrenders, through the Guru, it becomes one. ||1||
The Lord is without attributes; the attributes of virtue are under His control.
One who eliminates selfishness contemplates Him. ||1||Pause||
The deluded mind thinks of all sorts of corruption.
When the mind is deluded, the load of wickedness falls on the head.
But when the mind surrenders to the Lord, it realizes the One and Only Lord. ||2||
The deluded mind enters the house of Maya.
Engrossed in sexual desire, it does not remain steady.
O mortal, lovingly vibrate the Lord's Name with your tongue. ||3||
Elephants, horses, gold, children and spouses -
in the anxious affairs of all these, people lose the game and depart.
In the game of chess, their pieces do not reach their destination. ||4||
They gather wealth, but only evil comes from it.
Pleasure and pain stand in the doorway.
Intuitive peace comes by meditating on the Lord, within the heart. ||5||
When the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace, then He unites us in His Union.
Through the Word of the Shabad, merits are gathered in, and demerits are burned away.
The Gurmukh obtains the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||6||
Without the Name, all live in pain.
The consciousness of the foolish, self-willed manmukh is the dwelling place of Maya.
The Gurmukh obtains spiritual wisdom, according to pre-ordained destiny. ||7||
The fickle mind continuously runs after fleeting things.
The Pure True Lord is not pleased by filth.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||8||3||
Gauree Gwaarayree, First Mehl:
Acting in egotism, peace is not obtained.
The intellect of the mind is false; only the Lord is True.
All who love duality are ruined.
People act as they are pre-ordained. ||1||
I have seen the world to be such a gambler;
all beg for peace, but they forget the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
If the Unseen Lord could be seen, then He could be described.
Without seeing Him, all descriptions are useless.
The Gurmukh sees Him with intuitive ease.
So serve the One Lord, with loving awareness. ||2||
People beg for peace, but they receive severe pain.
They are all weaving a wreath of corruption.
You are false - without the One, there is no liberation.
The Creator created the creation, and He watches over it. ||3||
The fire of desire is quenched by the Word of the Shabad.
Duality and doubt are automatically eliminated.
Following the Guru's Teachings, the Naam abides in the heart.
Through the True Word of His Bani, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||4||
The True Lord abides within the body of that Gurmukh who enshrines love for Him.
Without the Naam, none obtain their own place.
The Beloved Lord King is dedicated to love.
If He bestows His Glance of Grace, then we realize His Name. ||5||
Emotional attachment to Maya is total entanglement.
The self-willed manmukh is filthy, cursed and dreadful.
Serving the True Guru, these entanglements are ended.
In the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam, you shall abide in lasting peace. ||6||
The Gurmukhs understand the One Lord, and enshrine love for Him.
They dwell in the home of their own inner beings, and merge in the True Lord.
The cycle of birth and death is ended.
This understanding is obtained from the Perfect Guru. ||7||
Speaking the speech, there is no end to it.
