You are the Almighty Overlord of all; You bless us with Your Glance of Grace. ||17||
Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
Take away my sexual desire, anger, pride, greed, emotional attachment and evil desires.
Protect me, O my God; Nanak is forever a sacrifice to You. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
By eating and eating, the mouth is worn out; by wearing clothes, the limbs grow weary.
O Nanak, cursed are the lives of those who are not attuned to the Love of the True Lord. ||2||
Pauree:
As is the Hukam of Your Command, so do things happen.
Wherever You keep me, there I go and stand.
With the Love of Your Name, I wash away my evil-mindedness.
By continually meditating on You, O Formless Lord, my doubts and fears are dispelled.
Those who are attuned to Your Love, shall not be trapped in reincarnation.
Inwardly and outwardly, they behold the One Lord with their eyes.
Those who recognize the Lord's Command never weep.
O Nanak, they are blessed with the gift of the Name, woven into the fabric of their minds. ||18||
Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
Those who do not remember the Lord while they are alive, shall mix with the dust when they die.
O Nanak, the foolish and filthy faithless cynic passes his life engrossed in the world. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
One who remembers the Lord while he is alive, shall be imbued with the Lord's Love when he dies.
The precious gift of his life is redeemed, O Nanak, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||2||
Pauree:
From the beginning, and through the ages, You have been our Protector and Preserver.
True is Your Name, O Creator Lord, and True is Your Creation.
You do not lack anything; You are filling each and every heart.
You are merciful and all-powerful; You Yourself cause us to serve You.
Those whose minds in which You dwell are forever at peace.
Having created the creation, You Yourself cherish it.
You Yourself are everything, O infinite, endless Lord.
Nanak seeks the Protection and Support of the Perfect Guru. ||19||
Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
In the beginning, in the middle and in the end, the Transcendent Lord has saved me.
The True Guru has blessed me with the Lord's Name, and I have tasted the Ambrosial Nectar.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord, night and day.
I have obtained all my objectives, and I shall not wander in reincarnation again.
Everything is in the Hands of the Creator; He does what is done.
Nanak begs for the gift of the dust of the feet of the Holy, which shall deliver him. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
Enshrine Him in your mind, the One who created you.
Whoever meditates on the Lord and Master obtains peace.
Fruitful is the birth, and approved is the coming of the Gurmukh.
One who realizes the Hukam of the Lord's Command shall be blessed - so has the Lord and Master ordained.
One who is blessed with the Lord's Mercy does not wander.
Whatever the Lord and Master gives him, with that he is content.
O Nanak, one who is blessed with the kindness of the Lord, our Friend, realizes the Hukam of His Command.
But those whom the Lord Himself causes to wander, continue to die, and take reincarnation again. ||2||
Pauree:
The slanderers are destroyed in an instant; they are not spared for even a moment.
God will not endure the sufferings of His slaves, but catching the slanderers, He binds them to the cycle of reincarnation.
