Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
First, they come forth from the womb.
They become attached to their children, spouses and families.
The foods of various sorts and appearances,
will surely pass away, O wretched mortal! ||1||
What is that place which never perishes?
What is that Word by which the dirt of the mind is removed? ||1||Pause||
In the Realm of Indra, death is sure and certain.
The Realm of Brahma shall not remain permanent.
The Realm of Shiva shall also perish.
The three dispositions, Maya and the demons shall vanish. ||2||
The mountains, the trees, the earth, the sky and the stars;
the sun, the moon, the wind, water and fire;
day and night, fasting days and their determination;
the Shaastras, the Simritees and the Vedas shall pass away. ||3||
The sacred shrines of pilgrimage, gods, temples and holy books;
rosaries, ceremonial tilak marks on the forehead, meditative people, the pure, and the performers of burnt offerings;
wearing loin cloths, bowing in reverence and the enjoyment of sacred foods -
all these, and all people, shall pass away. ||4||
Social classes, races, Muslims and Hindus;
beasts, birds and the many varieties of beings and creatures;
the entire world and the visible universe -
all forms of existence shall pass away. ||5||
Through the Praises of the Lord, devotional worship, spiritual wisdom and the essence of reality,
eternal bliss and the imperishable true place are obtained.
There, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the Lord's Glorious Praises are sung with love.
There, in the city of fearlessness, He dwells forever. ||6||
There is no fear, doubt, suffering or anxiety there;
there is no coming or going, and no death there.
There is eternal bliss, and the unstruck celestial music there.
The devotees dwell there, with the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises as their support. ||7||
There is no end or limitation to the Supreme Lord God.
Who can embrace His contemplation?
Says Nanak, when the Lord showers His Mercy,
the imperishable home is obtained; in the Saadh Sangat, you shall be saved. ||8||4||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
One who kills this is a spiritual hero.
One who kills this is perfect.
One who kills this obtains glorious greatness.
One who kills this is freed of suffering. ||1||
How rare is such a person, who kills and casts off duality.
Killing it, he attains Raja Yoga, the Yoga of meditation and success. ||1||Pause||
