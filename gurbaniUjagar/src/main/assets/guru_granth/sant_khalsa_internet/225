Janameja did not know the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Deluded by doubt, how could he find peace?
Making a mistake, for even an instant, you shall regret and repent later on. ||10||
Kansa the King and his warriors Kays and Chandoor had no equals.
But they did not remember the Lord, and they lost their honor.
Without the Lord of the Universe, no one can be saved. ||11||

Gauree, First Mehl:
I may anoint my limbs with sandalwood oil.
I may dress up and wear silk and satin clothes.
But without the Lord's Name, where would I find peace? ||1||
So what should I wear? In what clothes should I display myself?
Without the Lord of the Universe, how can I find peace? ||1||Pause||
I may wear ear-rings, and a pearl necklace around my neck;
my bed may be adorned with red blankets, flowers and red powder;
but without the Lord of the Universe, where can I search for peace? ||2||
I may have a beautiful woman with fascinating eyes;
she may decorate herself with the sixteen adornments, and make herself appear gorgeous.
But without meditating on the Lord of the Universe, there is only continual suffering. ||3||

he may place a crown upon his head, and carry a royal umbrella;
but without the Lord of the Universe, where can Truth be found? ||6||

he may give orders - "Do this now, do this then" - but this is a false display.
Without the Word of the Guru's Shabad, his works are not accomplished. ||7||

With the Guru's Teachings in my heart, I have come to know the Lord.
Prays Nanak, I seek Your Sanctuary. ||8||10||
Gauree, First Mehl:
Those who serve the One Lord, do not know any other.
They abandon the bitter worldly conflicts.
Through love and truth, they meet the Truest of the True. ||1||
Such are the humble devotees of the Lord.
They sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and their pollution is washed away. ||1||Pause||
The heart-lotus of the entire universe is upside-down.
The fire of evil-mindedness is burning up the world.
They alone are saved, who contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||2||
The bumble bee, the moth, the elephant, the fish
and the deer - all suffer for their actions, and die.
Trapped by desire, they cannot see reality. ||3||

Honor and good sense are lost, when one forgets the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||
