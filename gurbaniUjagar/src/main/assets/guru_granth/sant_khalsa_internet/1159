I have abandoned both the Pandits, the Hindu religious scholars, and the Mullahs, the Muslim pirEsts. ||1||Pause||
I weave and weave, and wear what I weave.
Where egotism does not exist, there I sing God's Praises. ||2||
Whatever the Pandits and Mullahs have written,
I reject; I do not accept any of it. ||3||
My heart is pure, and so I have seen the Lord within.
Searching, searching within the self, Kabeer has met the Lord. ||4||7||
No one respects the poor man.
He may make thousands of efforts, but no one pays any attention to him. ||1||Pause||
When the poor man goes to the rich man,
and sits right in front of him, the rich man turns his back on him. ||1||
But when the rich man goes to the poor man,
the poor man welcomes him with respect. ||2||
The poor man and the rich man are both brothers.
God's pre-ordained plan cannot be erased. ||3||
Says Kabeer, he alone is poor,
who does not have the Naam, the Name of the Lord, in his heart. ||4||8||
Serving the Guru, devotional worship is practiced.
Then, this human body is obtained.
Even the gods long for this human body.
So vibrate that human body, and think of serving the Lord. ||1||
Vibrate, and meditate on the Lord of the Universe, and never forget Him.
This is the blessed opportunity of this human incarnation. ||1||Pause||
As long as the disease of old age has not come to the body,
and as long as death has not come and seized the body,
and as long as your voice has not lost its power,
O mortal being, vibrate and meditate on the Lord of the World. ||2||
If you do not vibrate and meditate on Him now, when will you, O Sibling of Destiny?
When the end comes, you will not be able to vibrate and meditate on Him.
Whatever you have to do - now is the best time to do it.
Otherwise, you shall regret and repent afterwards, and you shall not be carried across to the other side. ||3||
He alone is a servant, whom the Lord enjoins to His service.
He alone attains the Immaculate Divine Lord.
Meeting with the Guru, his doors are opened wide,
and he does not have to journey again on the path of reincarnation. ||4||
This is your chance, and this is your time.
Look deep into your own heart, and reflect on this.
Says Kabeer, you can win or lose.
In so many ways, I have proclaimed this out loud. ||5||1||9||
In the City of God, sublime understanding prevails.
There, you shall meet with the Lord, and reflect on Him.
Thus, you shall understand this world and the next.
What is the use of claiming that you own everything, if you only dIE in the end? ||1||
I focus my meditation on my inner self, deep within.
The Name of the Sovereign Lord is my spiritual wisdom. ||1||Pause||
In the first chakra, the root chakra, I have grasped the reins and tied them.
I have firmly placed the moon above the sun.
The sun blazes forth at the western gate.
Through the central channel of the Shushmanaa, it rises up above my head. ||2||
There is a stone at that western gate,
and above that stone, is another window.
Above that window is the Tenth Gate.
Says Kabeer, it has no end or limitation. ||3||2||10||
He alone is a Mullah, who struggles with his mind,
and through the Guru's Teachings, fights with death.
He crushes the pride of the Messenger of Death.
Unto that Mullah, I ever offer greetings of respect. ||1||
