The self-willed manmukh is on the wrong side. You can see this with your own eyes.
He is caught in the trap like the deer; the Messenger of Death hovers over his head.
Hunger, thirst and slander are evil; sexual desire and anger are horrible.
These cannot be seen with your eyes, until you contemplate the Word of the Shabad.
Whoever is pleasing to You is content; all his entanglements are gone.
Serving the Guru, his capital is preserved. The Guru is the ladder and the boat.
O Nanak, whoever is attached to the Lord receives the essence; O True Lord, You are found when the mind is true. ||1||
First Mehl:
There is one path and one door. The Guru is the ladder to reach one's own place.
Our Lord and Master is so beautiful, O Nanak; all comfort and peace are in the Name of the True Lord. ||2||
Pauree:
He Himself created Himself; He Himself understands Himself.
Separating the sky and the earth, He has spread out His canopy.
Without any pillars, He supports the sky, through the insignia of His Shabad.
Creating the sun and the moon, He infused His Light into them.
He created the night and the day; Wondrous are His miraculous plays.
He created the sacred shrines of pilgrimage, where people contemplate righteousness and Dharma, and take cleansing baths on special occasions.
There is no other equal to You; how can we speak and describe You?
You are seated on the throne of Truth; all others come and go in reincarnation. ||1||
Shalok, First Mehl:
O Nanak, when it rains in the month of Saawan, four are delighted:
the snake, the deer, the fish and the wealthy people who seek pleasure. ||1||
First Mehl:
O Nanak, when it rains in the month of Saawan, four suffer the pains of separation:
the cow's calves, the poor, the travelers and the servants. ||2||
Pauree:
You are True, O True Lord; You dispense True Justice.
Like a lotus, You sit in the primal celestial trance; You are hidden from view.
Brahma is called great, but even he does not know Your limits.
You have no father or mother; who gave birth to You?
You have no form or feature; You transcend all social classes.
You have no hunger or thirst; You are satisfied and satiated.
You have merged Yourself into the Guru; You are pervading through the Word of Your Shabad.
When he is pleasing to the True Lord, the mortal merges in Truth. ||2||
Shalok, First Mehl:
The physician was called in; he touched my arm and felt my pulse.
The foolish physician did not know that the pain was in the mind. ||1||
Second Mehl:
O physician, you are a competent physician, if you first diagnose the disease.
Prescribe such a remedy, by which all sorts of illnesses may be cured.
Administer that medicine, which will cure the disease, and allow peace to come and dwell in the body.
Only when you are rid of your own disease, O Nanak, will you be known as a physician. ||2||
Pauree:
Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva and the deities were created.
Brahma was given the Vedas, and enjoined to worship God.
The ten incarnations, and Rama the king, came into being.
According to His Will, they quickly killed all the demons.
Shiva serves Him, but cannot find His limits.
He established His throne on the principles of Truth.
He enjoined all the world to its tasks, while He keeps Himself hidden from view.
