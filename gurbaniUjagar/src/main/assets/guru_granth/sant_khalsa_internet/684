One whose mind is imbued with the Lord's lotus feet
is not afflicted by the fire of sorrow. ||2||
He crosses over the world-ocean in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
He chants the Name of the Fearless Lord, and is imbued with the Lord's Love. ||3||
One who does not steal the wealth of others, who does not commit evil deeds or sinful acts -
the Messenger of Death does not even approach him. ||4||
God Himself quenches the fires of desire.
O Nanak, in God's Sanctuary, one is saved. ||5||1||55||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
I am satisfied and satiated, eating the food of Truth.
With my mind, body and tongue, I meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||
Life, spiritual life, is in the Lord.
Spiritual life consists of chanting the Lord's Name in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||1||Pause||
He is dressed in robes of all sorts,
if he sings the Kirtan of the Lord's Glorious Praises, day and night. ||2||
He rides upon elephants, chariots and horses,
if he sees the Lord's Path within his own heart. ||3||
Meditating on the Lord's Feet, deep within his mind and body,
slave Nanak has found the Lord, the treasure of peace. ||4||2||56||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
The Guru's feet emancipate the soul.
They carry it across the world-ocean in an instant. ||1||Pause||
Some love rituals, and some bathe at sacred shrines of pilgrimage.
The Lord's slaves meditate on His Name. ||1||
The Lord Master is the Breaker of bonds.
Servant Nanak meditates in remembrance on the Lord, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. ||2||3||57||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
Nothing can break his love for You,
the lifestyle of Your slave is so pure. ||1||Pause||
He is more dear to me than my soul, my breath of life, my mind and my wealth.
The Lord is the Giver, the Restrainer of the ego. ||1||
I am in love with the Lord's lotus feet.
This alone is Nanak's prayer. ||2||4||58||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Dhanaasaree, Ninth Mehl:
Why do you go looking for Him in the forest?
Although he is unattached, he dwells everywhere. He is always with you as your companion. ||1||Pause||
Like the fragrance which remains in the flower, and like the reflection in the mirror,
the Lord dwells deep within; search for Him within your own heart, O Siblings of Destiny. ||1||
Outside and inside, know that there is only the One Lord; the Guru has imparted this wisdom to me.
O servant Nanak, without knowing one's own self, the moss of doubt is not removed. ||2||1||
Dhanaasaree, Ninth Mehl:
O Holy people, this world is deluded by doubt.
It has forsaken the meditative remembrance of the Lord's Name, and sold itself out to Maya. ||1||Pause||
Mother, father, siblings, children and spouse - he is entangled in their love.
