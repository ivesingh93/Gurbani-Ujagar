Gond, Fifth Mehl:
Deal and trade only with the Lord, Raam, Raam.
The Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam, is the Support of the breath of life.
Sing the Kirtan of the Praises of the Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam.
The Lord is ever-present, all-pervading. ||1||
Joining the humble Saints, chant the Lord's Name.
This is the most immaculate and perfect occupation of all. ||1||Pause||
Gather the treasure, the wealth of the Lord, Raam, Raam.
Let your sustenance be the Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam.
Never forget the Lord, Raam, Raam.
In His Mercy, the Guru has revealed this to me. ||2||
The Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam, is always our help and support.
Embrace love for the Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam.
Through the Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam, I have become immaculate.
The sins of countless incarnations have been taken away. ||3||
Uttering the Lord's Name, birth and death are finished.
Repeating the Lord's Name, one crosses over the terrifying world-ocean.
The Luminous Lord is the highest of all.
Night and day, servant Nanak meditates on Him. ||4||8||10||
Gond, Fifth Mehl:
My Lord and Master has held back the five demons.
He conquered them, and scared them away from the Lord's slave.
They cannot find the mansion of the Lord's devotee.
Joining together, the Lord's humble servants sing the songs of joy. ||1||
The five demons are the rulers of the whole world,
but they are just water-carriers for the Lord's devotee. ||1||Pause||
They collect taxes from the world,
but they bow in subservience to God's devotees.
They plunder and dishonor the faithless cynics,
but they massage and wash the feet of the Holy. ||2||
The One Mother gave birth to the five sons,
and began the play of the created world.
With the three qualities joined together, they celebrate.
Renouncing these three qualities, the Lord's humble servants rise above them. ||3||
In His Mercy, He saves His humble servants.
They belong to Him, and so He saves them by driving out the five.
Says Nanak, devotion to God is noble and sublime.
Without devotion, all just waste away uselessly. ||4||9||11||
Gond, Fifth Mehl:
Suffering and troubles are eradicated by the Lord's Name.
Pain is dispelled, and peace takes its place.
Meditating, chanting the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, I am satisfied.
By the Grace of the Saints, I have received all fruitful rewards. ||1||
Meditating on the Lord, His humble servant is carried across,
and the sins of countless incarnations are taken away. ||1||Pause||
I have enshrined the Guru's feet within my heart,
and crossed over the ocean of fire.
All the painful diseases of birth and death have been eradicated.
I am attached to God in celestial Samaadhi. ||2||
In all places and interspaces, the One, our Lord and Master is contained.
He is the Inner-knower of all hearts.
One whom the Lord blesses with understanding,
chants the Name of God, twenty-four hours a day. ||3||
Deep within, God Himself abides;
within his heart, the Divine Light shines forth.
With loving devotion, sing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises.
Meditate on the Supreme Lord God, O Nanak, and you shall be saved. ||4||10||12||
