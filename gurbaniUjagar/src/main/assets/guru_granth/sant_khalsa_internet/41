Siree Raag, Fourth Mehl:
I stand by the wayside and ask the Way. If only someone would show me the Way to God-I would go with him.
I follow in the footsteps of those who enjoy the Love of my Beloved.
I beg of them, I implore them; I have such a yearning to meet God! ||1||
O my Siblings of Destiny, please unite me in Union with my Lord God.
I am a sacrifice to the True Guru, who has shown me the Lord God. ||1||Pause||
In deep humility, I fall at the Feet of the Perfect True Guru.
The Guru is the Honor of the dishonored. The Guru, the True Guru, brings approval and applause.
I am never tired of praising the Guru, who unites me with the Lord God. ||2||
Everyone, all over the world, longs for the True Guru.
Without the good fortune of destiny, the Blessed Vision of His Darshan is not obtained. The unfortunate ones just sit and cry.
All things happen according to the Will of the Lord God. No one can erase the pre-ordained Writ of Destiny. ||3||
He Himself is the True Guru; He Himself is the Lord. He Himself unites in His Union.
In His Kindness, He unites us with Himself, as we follow the Guru, the True Guru.
Over all the world, He is the Life of the World, O Nanak, like water mingled with water. ||4||4||68||
Siree Raag, Fourth Mehl:
The Essence of the Ambrosial Naam is the most sublime essence; how can I get to taste this essence?
I go and ask the happy soul-brides, "How did you come to meet God?
They are care-free and do not speak; I massage and wash their feet. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, meet with your spiritual friend, and dwell upon the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
The True Guru, the Primal Being, is your Friend, who shall drive out pain and subdue your ego. ||1||Pause||
The Gurmukhs are the happy soul-brides; their minds are filled with kindness.
The Word of the True Guru is the Jewel. One who believes in it tastes the Sublime Essence of the Lord.
Those who partake of the Lord's Sublime Essence, through the Guru's Love, are known as great and very fortunate. ||2||
This Sublime Essence of the Lord is in the forests, in the fields and everywhere, but the unfortunate ones do not taste it.
Without the True Guru, it is not obtained. The self-willed manmukhs continue to cry in misery.
They do not bow before the True Guru; the demon of anger is within them. ||3||
The Lord Himself, Har, Har, Har, is the Sublime Essence. The Lord Himself is the Essence.
In His Kindness, He blesses the Gurmukh with it; the Ambrosial Nectar of this Amrit trickles down.
Then, the body and mind totally blossom forth and flourish; O Nanak, the Lord comes to dwell within the mind. ||4||5||69||
Siree Raag, Fourth Mehl:
The day dawns, and then it ends, and the night passes away.
Man's life is diminishing, but he does not understand. Each day, the mouse of death is gnawing away at the rope of life.
Maya spreads out like sweet molasses; the self-willed manmukh is stuck like a fly, rotting away. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, God is my Friend and Companion.
Emotional attachment to children and spouse is poison; in the end, no one will go along with you as your helper. ||1||Pause||
Through the Guru's Teachings, some embrace love for the Lord, and are saved. They remain detached and unaffected, and they find the Sanctuary of the Lord.
