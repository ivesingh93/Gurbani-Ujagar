The foolish self-willed manmukh does not remember the Lord's Name; he wastes away his life in vain.
But when he meets the True Guru, then he obtains the Name; he sheds egotism and emotional attachment. ||3||
The Lord's humble servants are True - they practice Truth, and reflect upon the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
The True Lord God unites them with Himself, and they keep the True Lord enshrined in their hearts.
O Nanak, through the Name, I have obtained salvation and understanding; this alone is my wealth. ||4||1||
Sorat'h, Third Mehl:
The True Lord has blessed His devotees with the treasure of devotional worship, and the wealth of the Lord's Name.
The wealth of the Naam, shall never be exhausted; no one can estimate its worth.
With the wealth of the Naam, their faces are radiant, and they attain the True Lord. ||1||
O my mind, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Lord is found.
Without the Shabad, the world wanders around, and receives its punishment in the Court of the Lord. ||Pause||
Within this body dwell the five thieves: sexual desire, anger, greed, emotional attachment and egotism.
They plunder the Nectar, but the self-willed manmukh does not realize it; no one hears his complaint.
The world is blind, and its dealings are blind as well; without the Guru, there is only pitch darkness. ||2||
Indulging in egotism and possessiveness, they are ruined; when they depart, nothing goes along with them.
But one who becomes Gurmukh meditates on the Naam, and ever contemplates the Lord's Name.
Through the True Word of Gurbani, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord; blessed with the Lord's Glance of Grace, he is enraptured. ||3||
The spiritual wisdom of the True Guru is a steady light within the heart. The Lord's decree is over the heads of even kings.
Night and day, the Lord's devotees worship Him; night and day, they gather in the true profit of the Lord's Name.
O Nanak, through the Lord's Name, one is emancipated; attuned to the Shabad, he finds the Lord. ||4||2||
Sorat'h, Third Mehl:
If one becomes the slave of the Lord's slaves, then he finds the Lord, and eradicates ego from within.
The Lord of bliss is his object of devotion; night and day, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
Attuned to the Word of the Shabad, the Lord's devotees remain ever as one, absorbed in the Lord. ||1||
O Dear Lord, Your Glance of Grace is True.
Show mercy to Your slave, O Beloved Lord, and preserve my honor. ||Pause||
Continually praising the Word of the Shabad, I live; under Guru's Instruction, my fear has been dispelled.
My True Lord God is so beautiful! Serving the Guru, my consciousness is focused on Him.
One who chants the True Word of the Shabad, and the Truest of the True, the Word of His Bani, remains wakeful, day and night. ||2||
He is so very deep and profound, the Giver of eternal peace; no one can find His limit.
Serving the Perfect Guru, one becomes carefree, enshrining the Lord within the mind.
The mind and body become immaculately pure, and a lasting peace fills the heart; doubt is eradicated from within. ||3||
The Way of the Lord is always such a difficult path; only a few find it, contemplating the Guru.
Imbued with the Lord's Love, and intoxicated with the Shabad, he renounces ego and corruption.
O Nanak, imbued with the Naam, and the Love of the One Lord, he is embellished with the Word of the Shabad. ||4||3||
