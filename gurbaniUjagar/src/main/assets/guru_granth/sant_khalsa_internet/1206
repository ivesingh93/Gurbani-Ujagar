Searching and searching, I have come to this realization: all peace and bliss are in the Name of the Lord.
Says Nanak, he alone receives it, upon whose forehead such destiny is inscribed. ||4||11||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Night and day, utter the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
You shall obtain all wealth, all pleasures and successes, and the fruits of your mind's desires. ||1||Pause||
Come, O Saints, let us meditate in remembrance on God; He is the Eternal, Imperishable Giver of Peace and Praanaa, the Breath of Life.
Master of the masterless, Destroyer of the pains of the meek and the poor; He is All-pervading and permeating, abiding in all hearts. ||1||
The very fortunate ones drink in the Sublime Essence of the Lord, singing, reciting and listening to the Lord's Praises.
All their sufferings and struggles are wiped away from their bodies; they remain lovingly awake and aware in the Name of the Lord. ||2||
So abandon your sexual desire, greed, falsehood and slander; meditating in remembrance on the Lord, you shall be released from bondage.
The intoxication of loving attachments, egotism and blind possessiveness are eradicated by Guru's Grace. ||3||
You are All-powerful, O Supreme Lord God and Master; please be Merciful to Your humble servant.
My Lord and Master is All-pervading and prevailing everywhere; O Nanak, God is Near. ||4||12||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
I am a sacrifice to the Feet of the Divine Guru.
I meditate with Him on the Supreme Lord God; His Teachings have emancipated me. ||1||Pause||
All pains, diseases and fears are erased, for one who comes to the Sanctuary of the Lord's Saints.
He Himself chants, and inspires others to chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord. He is Utterly All-Powerful; He carries us across to the other side. ||1||
His Mantra drives out cynicism, and totally fills the empty one.
Those who obey the Order of the Lord's slaves, do not enter into the womb of reincarnation ever again. ||2||
Whoever works for the Lord's devotees and sings His Praises - his pains of birth and death are taken away.
Those unto whom my Beloved becomes Merciful, endure the Unendurable Ecstasy of the Lord, Har, Har. ||3||
Those who are satisfied by the Sublime Essence of the Lord, merge intuitively into the Lord; no mouth can describe their state.
By Guru's Grace, O Nanak, they are content; chanting and meditating on God's Name, they are saved. ||4||13||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
I sing, O I sing the Songs of Joy of my Lord, the Treasure of Virtue.
Fortunate is the time, fortunate is the day and the moment, when I become pleasing to the Lord of the World. ||1||Pause||
I touch my forehead to the Feet of the Saints.
The Saints have placed their hands on my forehead. ||1||
My mind is filled with the Mantra of the Holy Saints,
and I have risen above the three qualities||2||
Gazing upon the Blessed Vision, the Darshan of God's devotees, my eyes are filled with love.
Greed and attachment are gone, along with doubt. ||3||
Says Nanak, I have found intuitive peace, poise and bliss.
Tearing down the wall, I have met the Lord, the Embodiment of Supreme Bliss. ||4||14||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
How can I express the pain of my soul?
I am so thirsty for the Blessed Vision, the Darshan of my Enticing and Lovely Beloved. My mind cannot survive - it yearns for Him in so many ways. ||1||Pause||
