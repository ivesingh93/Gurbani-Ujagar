Gauree Bairaagan, First Mehl:
What if I were to become a deer, and live in the forest, picking and eating fruits and roots -
by Guru's Grace, I am a sacrifice to my Master. Again and again, I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice. ||1||
I am the shop-keeper of the Lord.
Your Name is my merchandise and trade. ||1||Pause||
If I were to become a cuckoo, living in a mango tree, I would still contemplate the Word of the Shabad.
I would still meet my Lord and Master, with intuitive ease; the Darshan, the Blessed Vision of His Form, is incomparably beautiful. ||2||
If I were to become a fish, living in the water, I would still remember the Lord, who watches over all beings and creatures.
My Husband Lord dwells on this shore, and on the shore beyond; I would still meet Him, and hug Him close in my embrace. ||3||
If I were to become a snake, living in the ground, the Shabad would still dwell in my mind, and my fears would be dispelled.
O Nanak, they are forever the happy soul-brides, whose light merges into His Light. ||4||2||19||
Gauree Poorbee Deepkee, First Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
In that house where the Praises of the Creator are chanted -
in that house, sing the Songs of Praise, and meditate in remembrance on the Creator Lord. ||1||
Sing the Songs of Praise of my Fearless Lord.
I am a sacrifice to that Song of Praise which brings eternal peace. ||1||Pause||
Day after day, He cares for His beings; the Great Giver watches over all.
Your gifts cannot be appraised; how can anyone compare to the Giver? ||2||
The day of my wedding is pre-ordained. Come - let's gather together and pour the oil over the threshold.
My friends, give me your blessings, that I may merge with my Lord and Master. ||3||
Unto each and every home, into each and every heart, this summons is sent out; the call comes each and every day.
Remember in meditation the One who summons us; O Nanak, that day is drawing near! ||4||1||20||

Third Mehl, Chau-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Meeting the Guru, we meet the Lord.
He Himself unites us in His Union.
My God knows all His Own Ways.
By the Hukam of His Command, He unites those who recognize the Word of the Shabad. ||1||
By the Fear of the True Guru, doubt and fear are dispelled.
Imbued with His Fear, we are absorbed in the Love of the True One. ||1||Pause||
Meeting the Guru, the Lord naturally dwells within the mind.
My God is Great and Almighty; His value cannot be estimated.
Through the Shabad, I praise Him; He has no end or limitations.
My God is the Forgiver. I pray that He may forgive me. ||2||
Meeting the Guru, all wisdom and understanding are obtained.
