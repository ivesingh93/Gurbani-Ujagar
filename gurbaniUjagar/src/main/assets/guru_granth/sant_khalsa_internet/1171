Why do you irrigate the barren, alkaline soil? You are wasting your life away!
This wall of mud is crumbling. Why bother to patch it with plaster? ||1||Pause||
Let your hands be the buckets, strung on the chain, and yoke the mind as the ox to pull it; draw the water up from the well.
Irrigate your fields with the Ambrosial Nectar, and you shall be owned by God the Gardener. ||2||
Let sexual desire and anger be your two shovels, to dig up the dirt of your farm, O Siblings of Destiny.
The more you dig, the more peace you shall find. Your past actions cannot be erased. ||3||
The crane is again transformed into a swan, if You so will, O Merciful Lord.
Prays Nanak, the slave of Your slaves: O Merciful Lord, have mercy on me. ||4||1||9||
Basant, First Mehl, Hindol:
In the House of the Husband Lord - in the world hereafter, everything is jointly owned; but in this world - in the house of the soul-bride's parents, the soul-bride owns them separately.
She herself is ill-mannered; how can she blame anyone else? She does not know how to take care of these things. ||1||
O my Lord and Master, I am deluded by doubt.
I sing the Word which You have written; I do not know any other Word. ||1||Pause||
She alone is known as the Lord's bride, who embroiders her gown in the Name.
She who preserves and protects the home of her own heart and does not taste of evil, shall be the Beloved of her Husband Lord. ||2||
If you are a learned and wise religious scholar, then make a boat of the letters of the Lord's Name.
Prays Nanak, the One Lord shall carry you across, if you merge in the True Lord. ||3||2||10||
Basant Hindol, First Mehl:
The king is just a boy, and his city is vulnerable. He is in love with his wicked enemies.
He reads of his two mothers and his two fathers; O Pandit, reflect on this. ||1||
O Master Pandit, teach me about this.
How can I obtain the Lord of life? ||1||Pause||
There is fire within the plants which bloom; the ocean is tied into a bundle.
The sun and the moon dwell in the same home in the sky. You have not obtained this knowledge. ||2||
One who knows the All-pervading Lord, eats up the one mother - Maya.
Know that the sign of such a person is that he gathers the wealth of compassion. ||3||
The mind lives with those who do not listen, and do not admit what they eat.
Prays Nanak, the slave of the Lord's slave: one instant the mind is huge, and the next instant, it is tiny. ||4||3||11||
Basant Hindol, First Mehl:
The Guru is the True Banker, the Giver of peace; He unites the mortal with the Lord, and satisfies his hunger.
Granting His Grace, He implants devotional worship of the Lord within; and then night and day, we sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||
O my mind, do not forget the Lord; keep Him in your consciousness.
Without the Guru, no one is liberated anywhere in the three worlds. The Gurmukh obtains the Lord's Name. ||1||Pause||
Without devotional worship, the True Guru is not obtained. Without good destiny, devotional worship of the Lord is not obtained.
Without good destiny, the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, is not obtained. By the grace of one's good karma, the Lord's Name is received. ||2||
In each and every heart, the Lord is hidden; He creates and watches over all. He reveals Himself in the humble, Saintly Gurmukhs.
Those who chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, are drenched with the Lord's Love. Their minds are drenched with the Ambrosial Water of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||3||
