The slanderer shall never attain emancipation; this is the Will of the Lord and Master.
The more the Saints are slandered, the more they dwell in peace. ||3||
The Saints have Your Support, O Lord and Master; You are the Saints' Help and Support.
Says Nanak, the Saints are saved by the Lord; the slanderers are drowned in the deep. ||4||2||41||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
He washes outwardly, but within, his mind is filthy; thus he loses his place in both worlds.
Here, he is engrossed in sexual desire, anger and emotional attachment; hereafter, he shall sigh and weep. ||1||
The way to vibrate and meditate on the Lord of the Universe is different.
Destroying the snake-hole, the snake is not killed; the deaf person does not hear the Lord's Name. ||1||Pause||
He renounces the affairs of Maya, but he does not appreciate the value of devotional worship.
He finds fault with the Vedas and the Shaastras, and does not know the essence of Yoga. ||2||
He stands exposed, like a counterfeit coin, when inspected by the Lord, the Assayer.
The Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, knows everything; how can we hide anything from Him? ||3||
Through falsehood, fraud and deceit, the mortal collapses in an instant - he has no foundation at all.
Truly, truly, truly, Nanak speaks; look within your own heart, and realize this. ||4||3||42||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Making the effort, the mind becomes pure; in this dance, the self is silenced.
The five passions are kept under control, and the One Lord dwells in the mind. ||1||
Your humble servant dances and sings Your Glorious Praises.
He plays upon the guitar, tambourine and cymbals, and the unstruck sound current of the Shabad resounds. ||1||Pause||
First, he instructs his own mind, and then, he leads others.
He chants the Lord's Name and meditates on it in his heart; with his mouth, he announces it to all. ||2||
He joins the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and washes their feet; he applies the dust of the Saints to his body
He surrenders his mind and body, and places them before the Guru; thus, he obtains the true wealth. ||3||
Whoever listens to, and beholds the Guru with faith, shall see his pains of birth and death taken away.
Such a dance eliminates hell; O Nanak, the Gurmukh remains wakeful. ||4||4||43||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The lowly outcaste becomes a Brahmin, and the untouchable sweeper becomes pure and sublime.
The burning desire of the nether regions and the etheric realms is finally quenched and extinguished. ||1||
The house-cat has been taught otherwise, and is terrified upon seeing the mouse.
The Guru has put the tiger under the control of the sheep, and now, the dog eats grass. ||1||Pause||
Without pillars, the roof is supported, and the homeless have found a home.
Without the jeweler, the jewel has been set, and the wonderful stone shines forth. ||2||
The claimant does not succeed by placing his claim, but by keeping silent, he obtains justice.
The dead sit on costly carpets, and what is seen with the eyes shall vanish. ||3||
