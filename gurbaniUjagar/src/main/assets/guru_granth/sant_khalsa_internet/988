Abandon all your entanglements and corruption; sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord forever.
With palms pressed together, Nanak begs for this blessing; please bless me with Your Name. ||2||1||6||
Maalee Gauraa, Fifth Mehl:
God is all-powerful, divine and infinite.
Who knows Your wondrous plays? You have no end or limitation. ||1||Pause||
In an instant, You establish and disestablish; You create and destroy, O Creator Lord.
As many beings as You created, God, so many You bless with Your blessings. ||1||
I have come to Your Sanctuary, Lord; I am Your slave, O Inaccessible Lord God.
Lift me up and pull me out of the terrifying, treacherous world-ocean; servant Nanak is forever a sacrifice to You. ||2||2||7||
Maalee Gauraa, Fifth Mehl:
The Lord of the World abides in my mind and body.
Friend of the meek, Lover of His devotees, forever and ever merciful. ||1||Pause||
In the beginning, in the end and in the middle, You alone exist, God; there is none other than You.
He is totally permeating and pervading all worlds; He is the One and only Lord and Master. ||1||
With my ears I hear God's Praises, and with my eyes I behold the Blessed Vision of His Darshan; with my tongue I sing the Lord's Glorious Praises.
Nanak is forever a sacrifice to You; please, bless me with Your Name. ||2||3||8||6||14||
Maalee Gauraa, The Word Of Devotee Naam Dayv Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Blessed, blessed is that flute which the Lord plays.
The sweet, sweet unstruck sound current sings forth. ||1||Pause||
Blessed, blessed is the wool of the sheep;
blessed, blessed is the blanket worn by Krishna. ||1||
Blessed, blessed are you, O mother Dayvakee;
into your home the Lord was born. ||2||
Blessed, blessed are the forests of Brindaaban;
the Supreme Lord plays there. ||3||
He plays the flute, and herds the cows;
Naam Dayv's Lord and Master plays happily. ||4||1||
O my Father, Lord of wealth, blessed are You, long-haired, dark-skinned, my darling. ||1||Pause||
You hold the steel chakra in Your hand; You came down from Heaven, and saved the life of the elephant.
In the court of Duhsaasan, You saved the honor of Dropati, when her clothes were being removed. ||1||
You saved Ahliyaa, the wife of Gautam; how many have You purified and carried across?
Such a lowly outcaste as Naam Dayv has come seeking Your Sanctuary. ||2||2||
Within all hearts, the Lord speaks, the Lord speaks.
Who else speaks, other than the Lord? ||1||Pause||
Out of the same clay, the elephant, the ant, and the many sorts of species are formed.
In stationary life forms, moving beings, worms, moths and within each and every heart, the Lord is contained. ||1||
Remember the One, Infinite Lord; abandon all other hopes.
Naam Dayv prays, I have become dispassionate and detached; who is the Lord and Master, and who is the slave? ||2||3||
