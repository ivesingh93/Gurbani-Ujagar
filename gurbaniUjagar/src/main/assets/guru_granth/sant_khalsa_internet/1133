He Himself blesses the Gurmukh with glorious greatness; O Nanak, he merges in the Naam. ||4||9||19||
Bhairao, Third Mehl:
Upon my writing tablet, I write the Name of the Lord, the Lord of the Universe, the Lord of the World.
In the love of duality, the mortals are caught in the noose of the Messenger of Death.
The True Guru nurtures and sustains me.
The Lord, the Giver of peace, is always with me. ||1||
Following his Guru's instructions, Prahlaad chanted the Lord's Name;
he was a child, but he was not afraid when his teacher yelled at him. ||1||Pause||
Prahlaad's mother gave her beloved son some advice:
My son, you must abandon the Lord's Name, and save your life!
Prahlaad said: "Listen, O my mother;
I shall never give up the Lord's Name. My Guru has taught me this."||2||
Sandaa and Markaa, his teachers, went to his father the king, and complained:
Prahlaad himself has gone astray, and he leads all the other pupils astray.
In the court of the wicked king, a plan was hatched.
God is the Savior of Prahlaad. ||3||
With sword in hand, and with great egotistical pride, Prahlaad's father ran up to him.
Where is your Lord, who will save you?
In an instant, the Lord appeared in a dreadful form, and shattered the pillar.
Harnaakhash was torn apart by His claws, and Prahlaad was saved. ||4||
The Dear Lord completes the tasks of the Saints.
He saved twenty-one generations of Prahlaad's descendents.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the poison of egotism is neutralized.
O Nanak, through the Name of the Lord, the Saints are emancipated. ||5||10||20||
Bhairao, Third Mehl:
The Lord Himself makes demons pursue the Saints, and He Himself saves them.
Those who remain forever in Your Sanctuary, O Lord - their minds are never touched by sorrow. ||1||
In each and every age, the Lord saves the honor of His devotees.
Prahlaad, the demon's son, knew nothing of the Hindu morning prayer, the Gayatri, and nothing about ceremonial water-offerings to his ancestors; but through the Word of the Shabad, he was united in the Lord's Union. ||1||Pause||
Night and day, he performed devotional worship service, day and night, and through the Shabad, his duality was eradicated.
Those who are imbued with Truth are immaculate and pure; the True Lord abides within their minds. ||2||
The fools in duality read, but they do not understand anything; they waste their lives uselessly.
The wicked demon slandered the Saint, and stirred up trouble. ||3||
Prahlaad did not read in duality, and he did not abandon the Lord's Name; he was not afraid of any fear.
The Dear Lord became the Savior of the Saint, and the demonic Death could not even approach him. ||4||
The Lord Himself saved his honor, and blessed his devotee with glorious greatness.
O Nanak, Harnaakhash was torn apart by the Lord with His claws; the blind demon knew nothing of the Lord's Court. ||5||11||21||
Raag Bhairao, Fourth Mehl, Chaupadas, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The Lord, in His Mercy, attaches mortals to the feet of the Saints.
