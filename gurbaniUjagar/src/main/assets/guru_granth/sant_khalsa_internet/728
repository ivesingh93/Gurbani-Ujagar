One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:
Raag Soohee, First Mehl, Chau-Padas, First House:
Wash the vessel, sit down and anoint it with fragrance; then, go out and get the milk.
Add the rennet of clear consciousness to the milk of good deeds, and then, free of desire, let it curdle. ||1||
Chant the Name of the One Lord.
All other actions are fruitless. ||1||Pause||
Let your mind be the handles, and then churn it, without sleeping.
If you chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, with your tongue, then the curd will be churned. In this way, the Ambrosial Nectar is obtained. ||2||
Wash your mind in the pool of Truth, and let it be the vessel of the Lord; let this be your offering to please Him.
That humble servant who dedicates and offers his life, and who serves in this way, remains absorbed in his Lord and Master. ||3||
The speakers speak and speak and speak, and then they depart. There is no other to compare to You.
Servant Nanak, lacking devotion, humbly prays: may I sing the Praises of the True Lord. ||4||1||
Soohee, First Mehl, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Deep within the self, the Lord abides; do not go outside looking for Him.
You have renounced the Ambrosial Nectar - why are you eating poison? ||1||
Meditate on such spiritual wisdom, O my mind,
and become the slave of the True Lord. ||1||Pause||
Everyone speaks of wisdom and meditation;
but bound in bondage, the whole world is wandering around in confusion. ||2||
One who serves the Lord is His servant.
The Lord is pervading and permeating the water, the land, and the sky. ||3||
I am not good; no one is bad.
Prays Nanak, He alone saves us! ||4||1||2||
