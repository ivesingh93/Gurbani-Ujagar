Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
He created you out of this water.
From clay, He fashioned your body.
He blessed you with the light of reason and clear consciousness.
In your mother's womb, He preserved you. ||1||
Contemplate your Savior Lord.
Give up all others thoughts, O mind. ||1||Pause||
He gave you your mother and father;
he gave you your charming children and siblings;
he gave you your spouse and friends;
enshrine that Lord and Master in your consciousness. ||2||
He gave you the invaluable air;
He gave you the priceless water;
He gave you burning fire;
let your mind remain in the Sanctuary of that Lord and Master. ||3||
He gave you the thirty-six varieties of tasty foods;
He gave you a place within to hold them;
He gave you the earth, and things to use;
enshrine in your consciousness the feet of that Lord and Master. ||4||
He gave you eyes to see, and ears to hear;
He gave you hands to work with, and a nose and a tongue;
He gave you feet to walk upon, and the crowning glory of your head;
O mind, worship the Feet of that Lord and Master. ||5||
He transformed you from impure to pure;
He installed you above the heads of all creatures;
now, you may fulfill your destiny or not;
Your affairs shall be resolved, O mind, meditating on God. ||6||
Here and there, only the One God exists.
Wherever I look, there You are.
My mind is reluctant to serve Him;
forgetting Him, I cannot survive, even for an instant. ||7||
I am a sinner, without any virtue at all.
I do not serve You, or do any good deeds.
By great good fortune, I have found the boat - the Guru.
Slave Nanak has crossed over, with Him. ||8||2||
