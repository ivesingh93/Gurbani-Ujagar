Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
Everyone longs for the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan.
By perfect destiny, it is obtained. ||Pause||
Forsaking the Beautiful Lord, how can they go to sleep?
The great enticer Maya has led them down the path of sin. ||1||
This butcher has separated them from the Beloved Lord.
This merciless one shows no mercy at all to the poor beings. ||2||
Countless lifetimes have passed away, wandering aimlessly.
The terrible, treacherous Maya does not even allow them to dwell in their own home. ||3||
Day and night, they receive the rewards of their own actions.
Don't blame anyone else; your own actions lead you astray. ||4||
Listen, O Friend, O Saint, O humble Sibling of Destiny:
in the Sanctuary of the Lord's Feet, Nanak has found Salvation. ||5||34||40||
Raag Soohee, Fifth Mehl, Fourth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Even a crude hut is sublime and beautiful, if the Lord's Praises are sung within it.
Those mansions where the Lord is forgotten are useless. ||1||Pause||
Even poverty is bliss, if God comes to mind in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
This worldly glory might just as well burn; it only traps the mortals in Maya. ||1||
One may have to grind corn, and wear a coarse blanket, but still, one can find peace of mind and contentment.
Even empires are of no use at all, if they do not bring satisfaction. ||2||
Someone may wander around naked, but if he loves the One Lord, he receives honor and respect.
Silk and satin clothes are worthless, if they lead to greed. ||3||
Everything is in Your Hands, God. You Yourself are the Doer, the Cause of causes.
With each and every breath, may I continue to remember You. Please, bless Nanak with this gift. ||4||1||41||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
The Lord's Saint is my life and wealth. I am his water-carrier.
He is dearer to me than all my siblings, friends and children. ||1||Pause||
I make my hair into a fan, and wave it over the Saint.
I bow my head low, to touch his feet, and apply his dust to my face. ||1||
I offer my prayer with sweet words, in sincere humility.
Renouncing egotism, I enter His Sanctuary. I have found the Lord, the treasure of virtue. ||2||
I gaze upon the Blessed Vision of the Lord's humble servant, again and again.
I cherish and gather in His Ambrosial Words within my mind; time and time again, I bow to Him. ||3||
In my mind, I wish, hope and beg for the Society of the Lord's humble servants.
Be Merciful to Nanak, O God, and lead him to the feet of Your slaves. ||4||2||42||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
She has enticed the worlds and solar systems; I have fallen into her clutches.
O Lord, please save this corrupt soul of mine; please bless me with Your Name. ||1||Pause||
She has not brought anyone peace, but still, I chase after her.
She forsakes everyone, but still, I cling to her, again and again. ||1||
Have Mercy on me, O Lord of Compassion; please let me sing Your Glorious Praises, O Lord.
This is Nanak's prayer, O Lord, that he may join and merge with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||2||3||43||
