The Lord of the Universe is permeating and pervading my mind and body; I see Him Ever-present, here and now
. O Nanak, He is permeating the inner being of all; He is all-pervading everywhere. ||2||8||12||
Malaar, Fifth Mehl:
Vibrating and meditating on the Lord, who has not been carried across?
Those reborn into the body of a bird, the body of a fish, the body of a deer, and the body of a bull - in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, they are saved. ||1||Pause||
The families of gods, the families of demons, titans, celestial singers and human beings are carried across the ocean.
Whoever meditates and vibrates on the Lord in the Saadh Sangat - his pains are taken away. ||1||
Sexual desire, anger and the pleasures of terrible corruption - he keeps away from these.
He meditates on the Lord, Merciful to the meek, the Embodiment of Compassion; Nanak is forever a sacrifice to Him. ||2||9||13||
Malaar, Fifth Mehl:
Today, I am seated in the Lord's store.
With the wealth of the Lord, I have entered into partnership with the humble; I shall not have take the Highway of Death. ||1||Pause||
Showering me with His Kindness, the Supreme Lord God has saved me; the doors of doubt have been opened wide.
I have found God, the Banker of Infinity; I have earned the profit of the wealth of His Feet. ||1||
I have grasped the protection of the Sanctuary of the Unchanging, Unmoving, Imperishable Lord; He has picked up my sins and thrown them out.
Slave Nanak's sorrow and suffering has ended. He shall never again be squeezed into the mold of reincarnation. ||2||10||14||
Malaar, Fifth Mehl:
In so many ways, attachment to Maya leads to ruin.
Among millions, it is very rare to find a selfless servant who remains a perfect devotee for very long. ||1||Pause||
Roaming and wandering here and there, the mortal finds only trouble; his body and wealth become strangers to himself.
Hiding from people, he practices deception; he does not know the One who is always with him. ||1||
He wanders through troubled incarnations of low and wretched species as a deer, a bird and a fish.
Says Nanak, O God, I am a stone - please carry me across, that I may enjoy peace in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||2||11||15||
Malaar, Fifth Mehl:
The cruel and evil ones died after taking poison, O mother.
And the One, to whom all creatures belong, has saved us. God has granted His Grace. ||1||Pause||
The Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, is contained within all; why should I be afraid, O Siblings of Destiny?
God, my Help and Support, is always with me. He shall never leave; I see Him everywhere. ||1||
He is the Master of the masterless, the Destroyer of the pains of the poor; He has attached me to the hem of His robe.
O Lord, Your slaves live by Your Support; Nanak has come to the Sanctuary of God. ||2||12||16||
Malaar, Fifth Mehl:
O my mind, dwell on the Feet of the Lord.
My mind is enticed by thirst for the Blessed Vision of the Lord; I would take wings and fly out to meet Him. ||1||Pause||
Searching and seeking, I have found the Path, and now I serve the Holy.
O my Lord and Master, please be kind to me, that I may drink in Your most sublime essence. ||1||
Begging and pleading, I have come to Your Sanctuary; I am on fire - please shower me with Your Mercy!
Please give me Your Hand - I am Your slave, O Lord. Please make Nanak Your Own. ||2||13||17||
