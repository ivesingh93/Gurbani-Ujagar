The One Lord is totally pervading and permeating all.
He alone meditates on the Lord, whose True Guru is Perfect.
Such a person has the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises for his Support.
Says Nanak, the Lord Himself is merciful to him. ||4||13||26||
Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
I was discarded and abandoned, but He has embellished me.
He has blessed me with beauty and His Love; through His Name, I am exalted.
All my pains and sorrows have been eradicated.
The Guru has become my Mother and Father. ||1||
O my friends and companions, my household is in bliss.
Granting His Grace, my Husband Lord has met me. ||1||Pause||
The fire of desire has been extinguished, and all my desires have been fulfilled.
The darkness has been dispelled, and the Divine Light blazes forth.
The Unstruck Sound-current of the Shabad, the Word of God, is wondrous and amazing!
Perfect is the Grace of the Perfect Guru. ||2||
That person, unto whom the Lord reveals Himself -
by the Blessed Vision of his Darshan, I am forever enraptured.
He obtains all virtues and so many treasures.
The True Guru blesses him with the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||3||
That person who meets with his Lord and Master -
his mind and body are cooled and soothed, chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
Says Nanak, such a humble being is pleasing to God;
only a rare few are blessed with the dust of his feet. ||4||14||27||
Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
The mortal does not hesitate to think about sin.
He is not ashamed to spend time with prostitutes.
He works all day long,
but when it is time to remember the Lord, then a heavy stone falls on his head. ||1||
Attached to Maya, the world is deluded and confused.
The Deluder Himself has deluded the mortal, and now he is engrossed in worthless worldly affairs. ||1||Pause||
Gazing on Maya's illusion, its pleasures pass away.
He loves the shell, and ruins his life.
Bound to blind worldly affairs, his mind wavers and wanders.
The Creator Lord does not come into his mind. ||2||
Working and working like this, he only obtains pain,
and his affairs of Maya are never completed.
His mind is saturated with sexual desire, anger and greed.
Wiggling like a fish out of water, he dies. ||3||
One who has the Lord Himself as his Protector,
chants and meditates forever on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, he chants the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
O Nanak, he has found the Perfect True Guru. ||4||15||28||
Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
He alone obtains it, unto whom the Lord shows Mercy.
He enshrines the Name of the Lord in his mind.
With the True Word of the Shabad in his heart and mind,
the sins of countless incarnations vanish. ||1||
The Lord's Name is the Support of the soul.
By Guru's Grace, chant the Name continually, O Siblings of Destiny; It shall carry you across the world-ocean. ||1||Pause||
Those who have this treasure of the Lord's Name written in their destiny,
those humble beings are honored in the Court of the Lord.
Singing His Glorious Praises with peace, poise and bliss,
even the homeless obtain a home hereafter. ||2||
Throughout the ages, this has been the essence of reality.
Meditate in remembrance on the Lord, and contemplate the Truth.
