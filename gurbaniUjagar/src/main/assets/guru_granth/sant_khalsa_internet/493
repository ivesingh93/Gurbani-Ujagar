Evil-minded, unfortunate and shallow-minded are those who feel anger in their minds, when they hear the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
You may place ambrosial nectar before crows and ravens, but they will be satisfied only by eating manure and dung with their mouths. ||3||
The True Guru, the Speaker of Truth, is the pool of Ambrosial Nectar; bathing within it, the crow becomes a swan.
O Nanak, blessed, blessed and very fortunate are those who, through the Guru's Teachings, with the Naam, wash away the filth of their hearts. ||4||2||
Goojaree, Fourth Mehl:
The humble servants of the Lord are exalted, and exalted is their speech. With their mouths, they speak for the benefit of others.
Those who listen to them with faith and devotion, are blessed by the Lord; showering His Mercy, He saves them. ||1||
Lord, please, let me meet the beloved servants of the Lord.
The True Guru, the Perfect Guru, is my Beloved, my very breath of life; the Guru has saved me, the sinner. ||1||Pause||
The Gurmukhs are fortunate, so very fortunate; their Support is the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
They obtain the Ambrosial Nectar of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; through the Guru's Teachings, they obtain this treasure-house of devotional worship. ||2||
Those who do not obtain the Blessed Vision of the Darshan of the True Guru, the True Primal Being, are most unfortunate; they are destroyed by the Messenger of Death.
They are like dogs, pigs and jackasses; they are cast into the womb of reincarnation, and the Lord strikes them down as the worst of murderers. ||3||
O Lord, Kind to the poor, please shower Your mercy upon Your humble servant, and save him.
Servant Nanak has entered the Lord's Sanctuary; if it pleases You, Lord, please save him. ||4||3||
Goojaree, Fourth Mehl:
Be Merciful and attune my mind, so that I might meditate continually on the Lord's Name, night and day.
The Lord is all peace, all virtue and all wealth; remembering Him, all misery and hunger depart. ||1||
O my mind, the Lord's Name is my companion and brother.
Under Guru's Instruction, I sing the Praises of the Lord's Name; it shall be my help and support in the end, and it shall deliver me in the Court of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
You Yourself are the Giver, O God, Inner-knower, Searcher of hearts; by Your Grace, You have infused longing for You in my mind.
My mind and body long for the Lord; God has fulfilled my longing. I have entered the Sanctuary of the True Guru. ||2||
Human birth is obtained through good actions; without the Name, it is cursed, totally cursed, and it passes away in vain.
Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, one obtains only suffering for his delicacies to eat. His mouth is insipid, and his face is spat upon, again and again. ||3||
Those humble beings, who have entered the Sanctuary of the Lord God, Har, Har, are blessed with glory in the Court of the Lord, Har, Har.
Blessed, blessed and congratulations, says God to His humble servant. O servant Nanak, He embraces him, and blends him with Himself. ||4||4||
Goojaree, Fourth Mehl:
O Gurmukhs, O my friends and companions, give me the gift of the Lord's Name, the life of my very life.
I am the slave, the servant of the Guru's Sikhs, who meditate on the Lord God, the Primal Being, night and day. ||1||
Within my mind and body, I have enshrined love for the feet of the Guru's Sikhs.
O my life-mates, O Sikhs of the Guru, O Siblings of Destiny, instruct me in the Teachings, that I might merge in the Lord's Merger. ||1||Pause||
