Hanuman with his tail is awake and aware.
Shiva is awake, serving at the Lord's Feet.
Naam Dayv and Jai Dayv are awake in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga. ||2||
There are many ways of being awake, and sleeping.
To be awake as Gurmukh is the most excellent way.
The most sublime of all the actions of this body,
says Kabeer, is to meditate and vibrate on the Lord's Name. ||3||2||
The wife gives birth to her husband.
The son leads his father in play.
Without breasts, the mother nurses her baby. ||1||
Behold, people! This is how it is in the Dark Age of Kali Yuga.
The son marries his mother. ||1||Pause||
Without feet, the mortal jumps.
Without a mouth, he bursts into laughter.
Without feeling sleepy, he lays down and sleeps.
Without a churn, the milk is churned. ||2||
Without udders, the cow gives milk.
Without travelling, a long journey is made.
Without the True Guru, the path is not found.
Says Kabeer, see this, and understand. ||3||3||
Prahlaad was sent to school.
He took many of his friends along with him.
He asked his teacher, "Why do you teach me about worldly affairs?
Write the Name of the Dear Lord on my tablet."||1||
O Baba, I will not forsake the Name of the Lord.
I will not bother with any other lessons. ||1||Pause||
Sanda and Marka went to the king to complain.
He sent for Prahlaad to come at once.
He said to him, "Stop uttering the Lord's Name.
I shall release you at once, if you obey my words."||2||
Prahlaad answered, "Why do you annoy me, over and over again?
God created the water, land, hills and mountains.
I shall not forsake the One Lord; if I did, I would be going against my Guru.
You might as well throw me into the fire and kill me."||3||
The king became angry and drew his sword.
Show me your protector now!
So God emerged out of the pillar, and assumed a mighty form.
He killed Harnaakhash, tearing him apart with his nails. ||4||
The Supreme Lord God, the Divinity of the divine,
for the sake of His devotee, assumed the form of the man-lion.
Says Kabeer, no one can know the Lord's limits.
He saves His devotees like Prahlaad over and over again. ||5||4||
Within the body and mind are thieves like sexual desire,
which has stolen my jewel of spiritual wisdom.
I am a poor orphan, O God; unto whom should I complain?
Who has not been ruined by sexual desire? What am I? ||1||
O Lord, I cannot endure this agonizing pain.
What power does my fickle mind have against it? ||1||Pause||
Sanak, Sanandan, Shiva and Suk Dayv
were born out of Brahma's naval chakra.
The poets and the Yogis with their matted hair
all lived their lives with good behavior. ||2||
You are Unfathomable; I cannot know Your depth.
O God, Master of the meek, unto whom should I tell my pains?
Please rid me of the pains of birth and death, and bless me with peace.
Kabeer utters the Glorious Praises of God, the Ocean of peace. ||3||5||
There is one merchant and five traders.
The twenty-five oxen carry false merchandise.
There are nine poles which hold the ten bags.
The body is tied by the seventy-two ropes. ||1||
I don't care at all about such commerce.
