Raag Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Twelfth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Renounce all your cleverness and remember the Supreme, Formless Lord God.
Without the One True Name, everything appears as dust. ||1||
Know that God is always with you.
By Guru's Grace, one understands, and is imbued with the Love of the One Lord. ||1||Pause||
Seek the Shelter of the One All-powerful Lord; there is no other place of rest.
The vast and terrifying world-ocean is crossed over, singing continually the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||2||
Birth and death are overcome, and one does not have to suffer in the City of Death.
He alone obtains the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, unto whom God shows His Mercy. ||3||
The One Lord is my Anchor and Support; the One Lord alone is the power of my mind.
O Nanak, joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, meditate on Him; without the Lord, there is no other at all. ||4||1||136||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The soul, the mind, the body and the breath of life belong to God. He has given all tastes and pleasures.
He is the Friend of the poor, the Giver of life, the Protector of those who seek His Sanctuary. ||1||
O my mind, meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
Here and hereafter, He is our Helper and Companion; embrace love and affection for the One Lord. ||1||Pause||
They meditate on the Vedas and the Shaastras, to swim across the world-ocean.
The many religious rituals, good deeds of karma and Dharmic worship - above all of these is the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||
Sexual desire, anger, and egotism depart, meeting with the Divine True Guru.
Implant the Naam within, perform devotional worship to the Lord and serve God - this is good. ||3||
I seek the Sanctuary of Your Feet, O Merciful Lord; You are the Honor of the dishonored.
You are the Support of my soul, my breath of life; O God, You are Nanak's strength. ||4||2||137||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
He wavers and falters, and suffers such great pain, without the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
The profit of the sublime essence of the Lord of the Universe is obtained, by the Love of the One Supreme Lord God. ||1||
Chant continually the Name of the Lord.
With each and every breath, meditate on God, and renounce other love. ||1||Pause||
God is the Doer, the All-powerful Cause of causes; He Himself is the Giver of life.
So renounce all your cleverness, and meditate on God, twenty-four hours a day. ||2||
He is our best friend and companion, our help and support; He is lofty, inaccessible and infinite.
Enshrine His Lotus Feet within your heart; He is the Support of the soul. ||3||
Show Your Mercy, O Supreme Lord God, that I may sing Your Glorious Praises.
Total peace, and the greatest greatness, O Nanak, are obtained by living to chant the Name of the Lord. ||4||3||138||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
I make the effort, as You cause me to do, my Lord and Master, to behold You in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
I am imbued with the color of the Love of the Lord, Har, Har; God Himself has colored me in His Love. ||1||
I chant the Lord's Name within my mind.
Bestow Your Mercy, and dwell within my heart; please, become my Helper. ||1||Pause||
Listening continually to Your Name, O Beloved God, I yearn to behold You.
