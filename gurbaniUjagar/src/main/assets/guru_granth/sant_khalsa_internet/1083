He is near this world and the nether regions of the underworld; His Place is permanent, ever-stable and imperishable. ||12||
The Purifier of sinners, the Destroyer of pain and fear.
The Eliminator of egotism, the Eradicator of coming and going.
He is pleased with devotional worship, and merciful to the meek; He cannot be appeased by any other qualities. ||13||
The Formless Lord is undeceivable and unchanging.
He is the Embodiment of Light; through Him, the whole world blossoms forth.
He alone unites with Him, whom He unites with Himself. No one can attain the Lord by himself. ||14||
He Himself is the milk-maid, and He Himself is Krishna.
He Himself grazes the cows in the forest.
You Yourself create, and You Yourself destroy. Not even a particle of filth attaches to You. ||15||
Which of Your Glorious Virtues can I chant with my one tongue?
Even the thousand-headed serpent does not know Your limit.
One may chant new names for You day and night, but even so, O God, no one can describe even one of Your Glorious Virtues. ||16||
I have grasped the Support, and entered the Sanctuary of the Lord, the Father of the world.
The Messenger of Death is terrifying and horrendous, and sea of Maya is impassable.
Please be merciful, Lord, and save me, if it is Your Will; please lead me to join with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||17||
All that is seen is an illusion.
I beg for this one gift, for the dust of the feet of the Saints, O Lord of the Universe.
Applying it to my forehead, I obtain the supreme status; he alone obtains it, unto whom You give it. ||18||
Those, unto whom the Lord, the Giver of peace, grants His Mercy,
grasp the feet of the Holy, and weave them into their hearts.
They obtain all the wealth of the Naam, the Name of the Lord; the unstruck sound current of the Shabad vibrates and resounds within their minds. ||19||
With my tongue I chant the Names given to You.
'Sat Naam' is Your perfect, primal Name.
Says Nanak, Your devotees have entered Your Sanctuary. Please bestow the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan; their minds are filled with love for You. ||20||
You alone know Your state and extent.
You Yourself speak, and You Yourself describe it.
Please make Nanak the slave of Your slaves, O Lord; as it pleases Your Will, please keep him with Your slaves. ||21||2||11||
Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:
O slave of the inaccessible Lord God Allah,
forsake thoughts of worldly entanglements.
Become the dust of the feet of the humble fakeers, and consider yourself a traveler on this journey. O saintly dervish, you shall be approved in the Court of the Lord. ||1||
Let Truth be your prayer, and faith your prayer-mat.
Subdue your desires, and overcome your hopes.
Let your body be the mosque, and your mind the pirEst. Let true purity be God's Word for you. ||2||
Let your practice be to live the spiritual life.
Let your spiritual cleansing be to renounce the world and seek God.
Let control of the mind be your spiritual wisdom, O holy man; meeting with God, you shall never die again. ||3||
Practice within your heart the teachings of the Koran and the Bible;
restrain the ten sensory organs from straying into evil.
Tie up the five demons of desire with faith, charity and contentment, and you shall be acceptable. ||4||
Let compassion be your Mecca, and the dust of the feet of the holy your fast.
Let Paradise be your practice of the Prophet's Word.
God is the beauty, the light and the fragrance. Meditation on Allah is the secluded meditation chamber. ||5||
