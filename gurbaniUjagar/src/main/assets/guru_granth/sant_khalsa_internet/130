He has no form or shape; He is seen within each and every heart. The Gurmukh comes to know the unknowable. ||1||Pause||
You are God, Kind and Merciful.
Without You, there is no other at all.
When the Guru showers His Grace upon us, He blesses us with the Naam; through the Naam, we merge in the Naam. ||2||
You Yourself are the True Creator Lord.
Your treasures are overflowing with devotional worship.
The Gurmukhs obtain the Naam. Their minds are enraptured, and they easily and intuitively enter into Samaadhi. ||3||
Night and day, I sing Your Glorious Praises, God.
I praise You, O my Beloved.
Without You, there is no other for me to seek out. It is only by Guru's Grace that You are found. ||4||
The limits of the Inaccessible and Incomprehensible Lord cannot be found.
Bestowing Your Mercy, You merge us into Yourself.
Through the Shabad, the Word of the Perfect Guru, we meditate on the Lord. Serving the Shabad, peace is found. ||5||
Praiseworthy is the tongue which sings the Lord's Glorious Praises.
Praising the Naam, one becomes pleasing to the True One.
The Gurmukh remains forever imbued with the Lord's Love. Meeting the True Lord, glory is obtained. ||6||
The self-willed manmukhs do their deeds in ego.
They lose their whole lives in the gamble.
Within is the terrible darkness of greed, and so they come and go in reincarnation, over and over again. ||7||
The Creator Himself bestows Glory on those,
whom He Himself has so pre-destined.
O Nanak, they receive the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the Destroyer of fear; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they find peace. ||8||1||34||
Maajh, Fifth Mehl, First House:
The Unseen Lord is within, but He cannot be seen.
He has taken the Jewel of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and He keeps it well concealed.
The Inaccessible and Incomprehensible Lord is the highest of all. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, He is known. ||1||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who chant the Naam, in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga.
The Beloved Saints were established by the True Lord. By great good fortune, the Blessed Vision of their Darshan is obtained. ||1||Pause||
The One who is sought by the Siddhas and the seekers,
upon whom Brahma and Indra meditate within their hearts,
whom the three hundred thirty million demi-gods search for-meeting the Guru, one comes to sing His Praises within the heart. ||2||
Twenty-four hours a day, the wind breathes Your Name.
The earth is Your servant, a slave at Your Feet.
In the four sources of creation, and in all speech, You dwell. You are dear to the minds of all. ||3||
The True Lord and Master is known to the Gurmukhs.
He is realized through the Shabad, the Word of the Perfect Guru.
Those who drink it in are satisfied. Through the Truest of the True, they are fulfilled. ||4||
In the home of their own beings, they are peacefully and comfortably at ease.
They are blissful, enjoying pleasures, and eternally joyful.
They are wealthy, and the greatest kings; they center their minds on the Guru's Feet. ||5||
First, You created nourishment;
then, You created the living beings.
There is no other Giver as Great as You, O my Lord and Master. None approach or equal You. ||6||
Those who are pleasing to You meditate on You.
They practice the Mantra of the Holy.
They themselves swim across, and they save all their ancestors and families as well. In the Court of the Lord, they meet with no obstruction. ||7||
