Attuned to the Beloved Lord, the mind is appeased, and finds the Perfect Guru. ||2||
I live, by cherishing Your Glorious Virtues; You dwell deep within me.
You dwell within my mind, and so it naturally celebrates in joyful delight. ||3||
O my foolish mind, how can I teach and instruct you?
As Gurmukh, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and so become attuned to His Love. ||4||
Continually, continuously, remember and cherish your Beloved Lord in your heart.
For if you depart with virtue, then pain shall never afflict you. ||5||
The self-willed manmukh wanders around, deluded by doubt; he does not enshrine love for the Lord.
He dies as a stranger to his own self, and his mind and body are spoiled. ||6||
Performing service to the Guru, you shall go home with the profit.
Through the Word of the Guru's Bani, and the Shabad, the Word of God, the state of Nirvaanaa is attained. ||7||
Nanak makes this one prayer: if it pleases Your Will,
bless me with a home in Your Name, Lord, that I may sing Your Glorious Praises. ||8||1||3||
Soohee, First Mehl:
As iron is melted in the forge and re-shaped,
so is the godless materialist reincarnated, and forced to wander aimlessly. ||1||
Without understanding, everything is suffering, earning only more suffering.
In his ego, he comes and goes, wandering in confusion, deluded by doubt. ||1||Pause||
You save those who are Gurmukh, O Lord, through meditation on Your Naam.
You blend with Yourself, by Your Will, those who practice the Word of the Shabad. ||2||
You created the Creation, and You Yourself gaze upon it; whatever You give, is received.
You watch, establish and disestablish; You keep all in Your vision at Your Door. ||3||
The body shall turn to dust, and the soul shall fly away.
So where are their homes and resting places now? They do not find the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, either. ||4||
In the pitch darkness of broad daylight, their wealth is being plundered.
Pride is looting their homes like a thief; where can they file their complaint? ||5||
The thief does not break into the home of the Gurmukh; he is awake in the Name of the Lord.
The Word of the Shabad puts out the fire of desire; God's Light illuminates and enlightens. ||6||
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is a jewel, a ruby; the Guru has taught me the Word of the Shabad.
One who follows the Guru's Teachings remains forever free of desire. ||7||
Night and day, enshrine the Lord's Name within your mind.
Please unite Nanak in Union, O Lord, if it is pleasing to Your Will. ||8||2||4||
Soohee, First Mehl:
Never forget the Naam, the Name of the Lord, from your mind; night and day, meditate on it.
As You keep me, in Your Merciful Grace, so do I find peace. ||1||
I am blind, and the Lord's Name is my cane.
I remain under the Sheltering Support of my Lord and Master; I am not enticed by Maya the enticer. ||1||Pause||
Wherever I look, there the Guru has shown me that God is always with me.
Searching inwardly and outwardly as well, I came to see Him, through the Word of the Shabad. ||2||
So serve the True Guru with love, through the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord.
As it pleases You, so by Your Will, You destroy my doubts and fears. ||3||
At the very moment of birth, he is afflicted with pain, and in the end, he comes only to die.
Birth and death are validated and approved, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||4||
When there is no ego, there You are; You fashioned all of this.
