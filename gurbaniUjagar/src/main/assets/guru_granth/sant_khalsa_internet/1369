Kabeer, the mind has become a bird; it soars and flies in the ten directions.
According to the company it keeps, so are the fruits it eats. ||86||
Kabeer, you have found that place which you were seeking.
You have become that which you thought was separate from yourself. ||87||
Kabeer, I have been ruined and destroyed by bad company, like the banana plant near the thorn bush.
The thorn bush waves in the wind, and pierces the banana plant; see this, and do not associate with the faithless cynics. ||88||
Kabeer, the mortal wants to walk on the path, carrying the load of others' sins on his head.
He is not afraid of his own load of sins; the road ahead shall be difficult and treacherous. ||89||
Kabeer, the forest is burning; the tree standing in it is crying out,
Do not let me fall into the hands of the blacksmith, who would burn me a second time. ||90||
Kabeer, when one died, two were dead. When two died, four were dead.
When four died, six were dead, four males and two females. ||91||
Kabeer, I have seen and observed, and searched all over the world, but I have found no place of rest anywhere.
Those who do not remember the Lord's Name - why do they delude themselves in other pursuits? ||92||
Kabeer, associate with the Holy people, who will take you to Nirvaanaa in the end.
Do not associate with the faithless cynics; they would bring you to ruin. ||93||
Kabeer, I contemplate the Lord in the world; I know that He is permeating the world.
Those who do not contemplate the Name of the Lord - their birth into this world is useless. ||94||
Kabeer, place your hopes in the Lord; other hopes lead to despair.
Those who dissociate themselves from the Lord's Name - when they fall into hell, then they will appreciate its value. ||95||
Kabeer has made many students and disciples, but he has not made God his friend.
He set out on a journey to meet the Lord, but his consciousness failed him half-way. ||96||
Kabeer, what can the poor creature do, if the Lord does not give him assistance?
Whatever branch he steps on breaks and collapses. ||97||
Kabeer, those who only preach to others - sand falls into their mouths.
They keep their eyes on the property of others, while their own farm is being eaten up. ||98||
Kabeer, I will remain in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, even if I have only coarse bread to eat.
Whatever will be, will be. I will not associate with the faithless cynics. ||99||
Kabeer, in the Saadh Sangat, love for the Lord doubles day by day.
The faithless cynic is like a black blanket, which does not become white by being washed. ||100||
Kabeer, you have not shaved your mind, so why do you shave your head?
Whatever is done, is done by the mind; it is useless to shave your head. ||101||
Kabeer, do not abandon the Lord; your body and wealth shall go, so let them go.
My consciousness is pierced by the Lord's Lotus Feet; I am absorbed in the Name of the Lord. ||102||
Kabeer, all the strings of the instrument I played are broken.
What can the poor instrument do, when the player has departed as well. ||103||
Kabeer, shave the mother of that guru, who does not take away one's doubt.
