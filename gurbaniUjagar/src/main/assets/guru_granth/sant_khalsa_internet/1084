He alone is a Qazi, who practices the Truth.
He alone is a Haji, a pilgrim to Mecca, who purifies his heart.
He alone is a Mullah, who banishes evil; he alone is a saintly dervish, who takes the Support of the Lord's Praise. ||6||
Always, at every moment,
remember God, the Creator within your heart.
Let your meditation beads be the subjugation of the ten senses. Let good conduct and self-restraint be your circumcision. ||7||
You must know in your heart that everything is temporary.
Family, household and siblings are all entanglements.
Kings, rulers and nobles are mortal and transitory; only God's Gate is the permanent place. ||8||
First, is the Lord's Praise; second, contentment;
third, humility, and fourth, giving to charities.
Fifth is to hold one's desires in restraint. These are the five most sublime daily prayers. ||9||
Let your daily worship be the knowledge that God is everywhere.
Let renunciation of evil actions be the water-jug you carry.
Let realization of the One Lord God be your call to prayer; be a good child of God - let this be your trumpet. ||10||
Let what is earned righteously be your blessed food.
Wash away pollution with the river of your heart.
One who realizes the Prophet attains heaven. Azraa-eel, the Messenger of Death, does not cast him into hell. ||11||
Let good deeds be your body, and faith your bride.
Play and enjoy the Lord's love and delight.
Purify what is impure, and let the Lord's Presence be your religious tradition. Let your total awareness be the turban on your head. ||12||
To be Muslim is to be kind-hearted,
and wash away pollution from within the heart.
He does not even approach worldly pleasures; he is pure, like flowers, silk, ghee and the deer-skin. ||13||
One who is blessed with the mercy and compassion of the Merciful Lord,
is the manliest man among men.
He alone is a Shaykh, a preacher, a Haji, and he alone is God's slave, who is blessed with God's Grace. ||14||
The Creator Lord has Creative Power; the Merciful Lord has Mercy.
The Praises and the Love of the Merciful Lord are unfathomable.
Realize the True Hukam, the Command of the Lord, O Nanak; you shall be released from bondage, and carried across. ||15||3||12||
Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:
The Abode of the Supreme Lord God is above all.
He Himself establishes, establishes and creates.
Holding tight to the Sanctuary of God, peace is found, and one is not afflicted by the fear of Maya. ||1||
He saved you from the fire of the womb,
and did not destroy you, when you were an egg in your mother's ovary.
Blessing you with meditative remembrance upon Himself, He nurtured you and cherished you; He is the Master of all hearts. ||2||
I have come to the Sanctuary of His lotus feet.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I sing the Praises of the Lord.
I have erased all the pains of birth and death; meditating on the Lord, Har, Har, I have no fear of death. ||3||
God is all-powerful, indescribable, unfathomable and divine.
All beings and creatures serve Him.
In so many ways, He cherishes those born from eggs, from the womb, from sweat and from the earth. ||4||
He alone obtains this wealth,
who savors and enjoys, deep within his mind, the Name of the Lord.
Grasping hold of his arm, God lifts him up and pulls him out of the deep, dark pit. Such a devotee of the Lord is very rare. ||5||
