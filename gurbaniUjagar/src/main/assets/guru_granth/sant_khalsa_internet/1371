Kabeer, the flamingo pecks and feeds, and remembers her chicks. She pecks and pecks and feeds, and remembers them always.
Just as the chicks are very dear to flamingo, so is the love of wealth and Maya to the mortal's mind. ||123||
Kabeer, the sky is overcast and cloudy; the ponds and lakes are overflowing with water.
Like the rainbird, some remain thirsty - what is their condition? ||124||
Kabeer, the chakvi duck is separated from her love through the night, but in the morning, she meets him again.
Those who are separated from the Lord do not meet Him in the day, or in the night. ||125||
Kabeer: O conch shell, remain in the ocean.
If you are separated from it, you shall scream at sunrise from temple to temple. ||126||
Kabeer, what are you doing sleeping? Wake up and cry in fear and pain.
Those who live in the grave - how can they sleep in peace? ||127||
Kabeer, what are you doing sleeping? Why not rise up and meditate on the Lord?
One day you shall sleep with your legs outstretched. ||128||
Kabeer, what are you doing sleeping? Wake up, and sit up.
Attach yourself to the One, from whom you have been separated. ||129||
Kabeer, do not leave the Society of the Saints; walk upon this Path.
See them, and be sanctified; meet them, and chant the Name. ||130||
Kabeer, do not associate with the faithless cynics; run far away from them.
If you touch a vessel stained with soot, some of the soot will stick to you. ||131||
Kabeer, you have not contemplated the Lord, and now old age has overtaken you.
Now that the door of your mansion is on fire, what can you take out? ||132||
Kabeer, the Creator does whatever He pleases.
There is none other than Him; He alone is the Creator of all. ||133||
Kabeer, the fruit trees are bearing fruit, and the mangoes are becoming ripe.
They will reach the owner, only if the crows do not eat them first. ||134||
Kabeer, some buy idols and worship them; in their stubborn-mindedness, they make pilgrimages to sacred shrines.
They look at one another, and wear religious robes, but they are deluded and lost. ||135||
Kabeer, someone sets up a stone idol and all the world worships it as the Lord.
Those who hold to this belief will be drowned in the river of darkness. ||136||
Kabeer, the paper is the prison, and the ink of rituals are the bars on the windows.
The stone idols have drowned the world, and the Pandits, the religious scholars, have plundered it on the way. ||137||
Kabeer, that which you have to do tomorrow - do it today instead; and that which you have to do now - do it immediately!
Later on, you will not be able to do anything, when death hangs over your head. ||138||
Kabeer, I have seen a person, who is as shiny as washed wax.
He seems very clever and very virtuous, but in reality, he is without understanding, and corrupt. ||139||
Kabeer, the Messenger of Death shall not compromise my understanding.
I have meditated on the Lord, the Cherisher, who created this Messenger of Death. ||140||
Kabeer, the Lord is like musk; all His slaves are like bumble bees.
