O Saints, my friends and companions, without the Lord, Har, Har, you shall perish.
Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and win this precious treasure of human life. ||1||Pause||
God has created Maya of the three qualities; tell me, how can it be crossed over?
The whirlpool is awesome and unfathomable; only through the Word of the Guru's Shabad is one carried across. ||2||
Searching and searching endlessly, seeking and deliberating, Nanak has realized the true essence of reality.
Meditating on the invaluable treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the jewel of the mind is satisfied. ||3||1||130||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Dupadas:
By Guru's Grace, He dwells within my mind; whatever I ask for, I receive.
This mind is satisfied with the Love of the Naam, the Name of the Lord; it does not go out, anywhere, anymore. ||1||
My Lord and Master is the highest of all; night and day, I sing the Glories of His Praises.
In an instant, He establishes and disestablishes; through Him, I frighten you. ||1||Pause||
When I behold my God, my Lord and Master, I do not pay any attention to any other.
God Himself has adorned servant Nanak; his doubts and fears have been dispelled, and he writes the account of the Lord. ||2||2||131||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The four castes and social classes, and the preachers with the six Shaastras on their finger-tips,
the beautiful, the refined, the shapely and the wise - the five passions have enticed and beguiled them all. ||1||
Who has seized and conquered the five powerful fighters? Is there anyone strong enough?
He alone, who conquers and defeats the five demons, is perfect in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga. ||1||Pause||
They are so awesome and great; they cannot be controlled, and they do not run away. Their army is mighty and unyielding.
Says Nanak, that humble being who is under the protection of the Saadh Sangat, crushes those terrible demons. ||2||3||132||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The Sublime Sermon of the Lord is the best thing for the soul. All other tastes are insipid. ||1||Pause||
The worthy beings, heavenly singers, silent sages and the knowers of the six Shaastras proclaim that nothing else is worthy of consideration. ||1||
It is the cure for evil passions, unique, unequalled and peace-giving; in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O Nanak, drink it in. ||2||4||133||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
My Beloved has brought forth a river of nectar. The Guru has not held it back from my mind, even for an instant. ||1||Pause||
Beholding it, and touching it, I am sweetened and delighted. It is imbued with the Creator's Love. ||1||
Chanting it even for a moment, I rise to the Guru; meditating on it, one is not trapped by the Messenger of Death. The Lord has placed it as a garland around Nanak's neck, and within his heart. ||2||5||134||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is exalted and sublime. ||Pause||
Every day, hour and moment, I continually sing and speak of Govind, Govind, the Lord of the Universe. ||1||
Walking, sitting and sleeping, I chant the Lord's Praises; I treasure His Feet in my mind and body. ||2||
I am so small, and You are so great, O Lord and Master; Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary. ||3||6||135||
