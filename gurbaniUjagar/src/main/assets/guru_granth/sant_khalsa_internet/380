He may proclaim, "I can kill anyone, I can capture anyone, and I can release anyone".
But when the Order comes from the Supreme Lord God, he departs and leaves in a day. ||2||
He may perform all sorts of religious rituals and good actions, but he does not know the Creator Lord, the Doer of all.
He teaches, but does not practice what he preaches; he does not realize the essential reality of the Word of the Shabad.
Naked he came, and naked he shall depart; he is like an elephant, throwing dust on himself. ||3||
O Saints, and friends, listen to me: all this world is false.
Continually claiming, "Mine, mine", the mortals are drowned; the fools waste away and die.
Meeting the Guru, O Nanak, I meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; through the True Name, I am emancipated. ||4||1||38||
Raag Aasaa, Fifth House, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The whole world is asleep in doubt; it is blinded by worldly entanglements.
How rare is that humble servant of the Lord who is awake and aware. ||1||
The mortal is intoxicated with the great enticement of Maya, which is dearer to him than life.
How rare is the one who renounces it. ||2||
The Lord's Lotus Feet are incomparably beautiful; so is the Mantra of the Saint.
How rare is that holy person who is attached to them. ||3||
O Nanak, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the love of divine knowledge is awakened;
the Lord's Mercy is bestowed upon those who are blessed with such good destiny. ||4||1||39||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Raag Aasaa, Sixth House, Fifth Mehl:
Whatever pleases You is acceptable to me; that alone brings peace and ease to my mind.
You are the Doer, the Cause of causes, All-powerful and Infinite; there is none other than You. ||1||
Your humble servants sing Your Glorious Praises with enthusiasm and love.
That alone is good advice, wisdom and cleverness for Your humble servant, which You do or cause to be done. ||1||Pause||
Your Name is Ambrosial Nectar, O Beloved Lord; in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I have obtained its sublime essence.
Those humble beings are satisfied and fulfilled, singing the Praises of the Lord, the treasure of peace. ||2||
One who has Your Support, O Lord Master, is not afflicted by anxiety.
One who is blessed by Your Kind Mercy, is the best, the most fortunate king. ||3||
Doubt, attachment, and deceit have all disappeared, since I obtained the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.
Dealing in the Naam, O Nanak, we become truthful, and in the Love of the Lord's Name, we are absorbed. ||4||1 | 40||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
He washes off the filth of other peoples' incarnations, but he obtains the rewards of his own actions.
He has no peace in this world, and he has no place in the Court of the Lord. In the City of Death, he is tortured. ||1||
The slanderer loses his life in vain.
He cannot succeed in anything, and in the world hereafter, he finds no place at all. ||1||Pause||
Such is the fate of the wretched slanderer - what can the poor creature do?
He is ruined there, where no one can protect him; with whom should he lodge his complaint? ||2||
