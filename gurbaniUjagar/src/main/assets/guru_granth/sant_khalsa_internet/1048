He dwells in each and every heart, the Great Giver, the Life of the world.
At the same time, He is both hidden and revealed. For the Gurmukh, doubt and fear are dispelled. ||15||
The Gurmukh knows the One, the Dear Lord.
Deep within the nucleus of his inner being, is the Naam, the Name of the Lord; he realizes the Word of the Shabad.
He alone receives it, unto whom You give it. O Nanak, the Naam is glorious greatness. ||16||4||
Maaroo, Third Mehl:
I praise the true, profound and unfathomable Lord.
All the world is in His power.
He enjoys all hearts forever, day and night; He Himself dwells in peace. ||1||
True is the Lord and Master, and True is His Name.
By Guru's Grace, I enshrine Him in my mind.
He Himself has come to dwell deep within the nucleus of my heart; the noose of death has been snapped. ||2||
Whom should I serve, and whom should I praise?
I serve the True Guru, and praise the Word of the Shabad.
Through the True Shabad, the intellect is exalted and ennobled forever, and the lotus deep within blossoms forth. ||3||
The body is frail and perishable, like paper.
When the drop of water falls upon it, it crumbles and dissolves instantaneously.
But the body of the Gurmukh, who understands, is like gold; the Naam, the Name of the Lord, dwells deep within. ||4||
Pure is that kitchen, which is enclosed by spiritual awareness.
The Lord's Name is my food, and Truth is my support.
Forever satisfied, sanctified and pure is that person, within whose heart the Lord's Name abides. ||5||
I am a sacrifice to those who are attached to the Truth.
They sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and remain awake and aware night and day.
True peace fills them forever, and their tongues savor the sublime essence of the Lord. ||6||
I remember the Lord's Name, and no other at all.
I serve the One Lord, and no other at all.
The Perfect Guru has revealed the whole Truth to me; I dwell in the True Name. ||7||
Wandering, wandering in reincarnation, again and again, he comes into the world.
He is deluded and confused, when the Lord and Master confuses him.
He meets with the Dear Lord, when, as Gurmukh, he understands; he remembers the Shabad, the Word of the immortal, eternal Lord God. ||8||
I am a sinner, overflowing with sexual desire and anger.
With what mouth should I speak? I have no virtue, and I have rendered no service.
I am a sinking stone; please, Lord, unite me with Yourself. Your Name is eternal and imperishable. ||9||
No one does anything; no one is able to do anything.
That alone happens, which the Lord Himself does, and causes to be done.
Those whom He Himself forgives, find peace; they dwell forever in the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||10||
This body is the earth, and the infinite Shabad is the seed.
Deal and trade with the True Name alone.
The True wealth increases; it is never exhausted, when the Naam dwells deep within. ||11||
O Dear Lord, please bless me, the worthless sinner, with virtue.
Forgive me, and bless me with Your Name.
One who becomes Gurmukh, is honored; he dwells in the Name of the One Lord alone. ||12||
The wealth of the Lord is deep within one's inner being, but he does not realize it.
By Guru's Grace, one comes to understand.
One who becomes Gurmukh is blessed with this wealth; he lives forever in the Naam. ||13||
Fire and wind lead him into delusions of doubt.
