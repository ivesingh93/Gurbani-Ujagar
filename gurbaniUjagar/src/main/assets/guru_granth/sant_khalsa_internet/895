That mind is excellent and sublime, which meditates in remembrance on the Lord.
In His Mercy, the Lord Himself bestows it.

Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
Abandon all your clever tricks.
Become His servant, and serve Him.
Totally erase your self-conceit.
You shall obtain the fruits of your mind's desires. ||1||
Be awake and aware with your Guru.
Your hopes and desires shall be fulfilled, and you shall obtain all treasures from the Guru. ||1||Pause||

The True Guru is the Immaculate Lord.
Do not believe that He is a mere human being;
He gives honor to the dishonored. ||2||
Hold tight to the Support of the Guru, the Lord.
Give up all other hopes.
Ask for the treasure of the Name of the Lord,
and then you shall be honored in the Court of the Lord. ||3||
Chant the Mantra of the Guru's Word.
This is the essence of true devotional worship.
When the True Guru becomes merciful,
slave Nanak is enraptured. ||4||28||39||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
Whatever happens, accept that as good.
Leave your egotistical pride behind.
Day and night, continually sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
This is the perfect purpose of human life. ||1||
Meditate on the Lord, O Saints, and be in bliss.
Renounce your cleverness and all your tricks. Chant the Immaculate Chant of the Guru's Mantra. ||1||Pause||
Place the hopes of your mind in the One Lord.
Chant the Immaculate Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
Bow down to the Guru's Feet,
and cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||2||
The Lord God is the Great Giver.
He has no end or limitation.
All treasures are in His home.
He will be your Saving Grace in the end. ||3||
Nanak has obtained this treasure,
the immaculate Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
Whoever chants it, is emancipated.
It is obtained only by His Grace. ||4||29||40||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
Make this invaluable human life fruitful.
You shall not be destroyed when you go to the Lord's Court.
In this world and the next, you shall obtain honor and glory.
At the very last moment, He will save you. ||1||
Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
In both this world and the next, you shall be embellished with beauty, meditating on the wondrous Primal Lord God. ||1||Pause||
While standing up and sitting down, meditate on the Lord,
and all your troubles shall depart.
All your enemies will become friends.
Your consciousness shall be immaculate and pure. ||2||
This is the most exalted deed.
Of all faiths, this is the most sublime and excellent faith.
Meditating in remembrance on the Lord, you shall be saved.
You shall be rid of the burden of countless incarnations. ||3||
Your hopes shall be fulfilled,
and the noose of the Messenger of Death will be cut away.
So listen to the Guru's Teachings.
O Nanak, you shall be absorbed in celestial peace. ||4||30||41||
