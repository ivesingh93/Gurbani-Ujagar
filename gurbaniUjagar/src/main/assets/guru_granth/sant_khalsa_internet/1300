Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
In the Sanctuary of the Holy, I focus my consciousness on the Lord's Feet.
When I was dreaming, I heard and saw only dream-objects. The True Guru has implanted the Mantra of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within me. ||1||Pause||
Power, youth and wealth do not bring satisfaction; people chase after them again and again.
I have found peace and tranquility, and all my thirsty desires have been quenched, singing His Glorious Praises. ||1||
Without understanding, they are like beasts, engrossed in doubt, emotional attachment and Maya.
But in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the noose of Death is cut, O Nanak, and one intuitively merges in celestial peace. ||2||10||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
Sing of the Lord's Feet within your heart.
Meditate, meditate in constant remembrance on God, the Embodiment of soothing peace and cooling tranquility. ||1||Pause||
All your hopes shall be fulfilled, and the pain of millions of deaths and births shall be gone. ||1||
Immerse yourself in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and you shall obtain the benefits of giving charitable gifts, and all sorts of good deeds.
Sorrow and suffering shall be erased, O Nanak, and you shall never again be devoured by death. ||2||11||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl, Third House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Speak of God's Wisdom in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation.
Meditating in remembrance on the Perfect Supreme Divine Light, the Transcendent Lord God, honor and glory are obtained. ||1||Pause||
One's comings and goings in reincarnation cease, and suffering is dispelled, meditating in remembrance in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
Sinners are sanctified in an instant, in the love of the Supreme Lord God. ||1||
Whoever speaks and listens to the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises is rid of evil-mindedness.
All hopes and desires, O Nanak, are fulfilled. ||2||1||12||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
The Treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is found in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
It is the Companion of the soul, its Helper and Support. ||1||Pause||
Continually bathing in the dust of the feet of the Saints,
the sins of countless incarnations are washed away. ||1||
The words of the humble Saints are lofty and exalted.
Meditating, meditating in remembrance, O Nanak, mortal beings are carried across and saved. ||2||2||13||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
O Holy people, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, Har, Haray.
Mind, body, wealth and the breath of life - all come from God; remembering Him in meditation, pain is taken away. ||1||Pause||
Why are you entangled in this and that? Let your mind be attuned to the One. ||1||
The place of the Saints is utterly sacred; meet with them, and meditate on the Lord of the Universe. ||2||
O Nanak, I have abandoned everything and come to Your Sanctuary. Please let me merge with You. ||3||3||14||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
Gazing upon and beholding my Best Friend, I blossom forth in bliss; my God is the One and Only. ||1||Pause||
He is the Image of Ecstasy, Intuitive Peace and Poise. There is no other like Him. ||1||
Meditating in remembrance on the Lord, Har, Har, even once, millions of sins are erased. ||2||
