You Yourself created the counterfeit and the genuine.
You Yourself appraise all people.
You appraise the true, and place them in Your Treasury; You consign the false to wander in delusion. ||6||
How can I behold You? How can I praise You?
By Guru's Grace, I praise You through the Word of the Shabad.
In Your Sweet Will, the Amrit is found; by Your Will, You inspire us to drink in this Amrit. ||7||
The Shabad is Amrit; the Lord's Bani is Amrit.
Serving the True Guru, it permeates the heart.
O Nanak, the Ambrosial Naam is forever the Giver of peace; drinking in this Amrit, all hunger is satisfied. ||8||15||16||
Maajh, Third Mehl:
The Ambrosial Nectar rains down, softly and gently.
How rare are those Gurmukhs who find it.
Those who drink it in are satisfied forever. Showering His Mercy upon them, the Lord quenches their thirst. ||1||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those Gurmukhs who drink in this Ambrosial Nectar.
The tongue tastes the essence, and remains forever imbued with the Lord's Love, intuitively singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
By Guru's Grace, intuitive understanding is obtained;
subduing the sense of duality, they are in love with the One.
When He bestows His Glance of Grace, then they sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord; by His Grace, they merge in Truth. ||2||
Above all is Your Glance of Grace, O God.
Upon some it is bestowed less, and upon others it is bestowed more.
Without You, nothing happens at all; the Gurmukhs understand this. ||3||
The Gurmukhs contemplate the essence of reality;
Your Treasures are overflowing with Ambrosial Nectar.
Without serving the True Guru, no one obtains it. It is obtained only by Guru's Grace. ||4||
Those who serve the True Guru are beautiful.
The Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, entices their inner minds.
Their minds and bodies are attuned to the Ambrosial Bani of the Word; this Ambrosial Nectar is intuitively heard. ||5||
The deluded, self-willed manmukhs are ruined through the love of duality.
They do not chant the Naam, and they die, eating poison.
Night and day, they continually sit in manure. Without selfless service, their lives are wasted away. ||6||
They alone drink in this Amrit, whom the Lord Himself inspires to do so.
By Guru's Grace, they intuitively enshrine love for the Lord.
The Perfect Lord is Himself perfectly pervading everywhere; through the Guru's Teachings, He is perceived. ||7||
He Himself is the Immaculate Lord.
He who has created, shall Himself destroy.
O Nanak, remember the Naam forever, and you shall merge into the True One with intuitive ease. ||8||16||17||
Maajh, Third Mehl:
Those who please You are linked to the Truth.
They serve the True One forever, with intuitive ease.
Through the True Word of the Shabad, they praise the True One, and they merge in the merging of Truth. ||1||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who praise the True One.
Those who meditate on the True One are attuned to Truth; they are absorbed into the Truest of the True. ||1||Pause||
The True One is everywhere, wherever I look.
By Guru's Grace, I enshrine Him in my mind.
True are the bodies of those whose tongues are attuned to Truth. They hear the Truth, and speak it with their mouths. ||2||
