So many gods yearn for the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
All the devotees serve Him.
He is the Master of the masterless, the Destroyer of the pains of the poor. His Name is obtained from the Perfect Guru. ||3||
I cannot conceive of any other door.
One who wanders through the three worlds, understands nothing.
The True Guru is the banker, with the treasure of the Naam. This jewel is obtained from Him. ||4||
The dust of His feet purifies.
Even the angelic beings and gods cannot obtain it, O friend.
The True Guru is the True Primal Being, the Transcendent Lord God; meeting with Him, one is carried across to the other side. ||5||
O my beloved mind, if you wish for the 'tree of life';
if you wish for Kaamadhayna, the wish-fulfilling cow to adorn your court;
if you wish to be satisfied and contented, then serve the Perfect Guru, and practice the Naam, the source of nectar. ||6||
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the five thieves of desire are conquered.
In the Fear of the Supreme Lord God, you shall become immaculate and pure.
When one meets the Perfect Guru, the Philosopher's Stone, His touch reveals the Lord, the Philosopher's Stone. ||7||
Myriads of heavens do not equal the Lord's Name.
The spiritually wise forsake mere liberation.
The One Universal Creator Lord is found through the True Guru. I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan. ||8||
No one knows how to serve the Guru.
The Guru is the unfathomable, Supreme Lord God.
He alone is the Guru's servant, whom the Guru Himself links to His service, and upon whose forehead such blessed destiny is inscribed. ||9||
Even the Vedas do not know the Guru's Glory.
They narrate only a tiny bit of what is heard.
The True Guru is the Supreme Lord God, the Incomparable One; meditating in remembrance on Him, the mind is cooled and soothed. ||10||
Hearing of Him, the mind comes to life.
When He dwells within the heart, one becomes peaceful and cool.
Chanting the Guru's Name with the mouth, one obtains glory, and does not have to walk on the Path of Death. ||11||
I have entered the Sanctuary of the Saints,
and placed before them my soul, my breath of life and wealth.
I know nothing about service and awareness; please take pity upon this worm. ||12||
I am unworthy; please merge me into Yourself.
Please bless me with Your Grace, and link me to Your service.
I wave the fan, and grind the corn for the Saints; washing their feet, I find peace. ||13||
After wandering around at so many doors, I have come to Yours, O Lord.
By Your Grace, I have entered Your Sanctuary.
Forever and ever, keep me in the Company of the Saints; please bless me with this Gift of Your Name. ||14||
My World-Lord has become merciful,
and I have obtained the Blessed Vision of the Darshan of the Perfect True Guru.
I have found eternal peace, poise and bliss; Nanak is the slave of Your slaves. ||15||2||7||
Maaroo, Solahas, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The earth and the Akaashic ethers meditate in remembrance.
The moon and the sun meditate in remembrance on You, O treasure of virtue.
Air, water and fire meditate in remembrance. All creation meditates in remembrance. ||1||
