Aasaa, First Mehl:
When the body perishes, whose wealth is it?
Without the Guru, how can the Lord's Name be obtained?
The wealth of the Lord's Name is my Companion and Helper.
Night and day, center your loving attention on the Immaculate Lord. ||1||
Without the Lord's Name, who is ours?
I look upon pleasure and pain alike; I shall not forsake the Naam, the Name of the Lord. The Lord Himself forgives me, and blends me with Himself. ||1||Pause||
The fool loves gold and women.
Attached to duality, he has forgotten the Naam.
O Lord, he alone chants the Naam, whom You have forgiven.
Death cannot touch one who sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||2||
The Lord, the Guru, is the Giver; the Lord, the Sustainer of the World.
If it is pleasing to Your Will, please preserve me, O Merciful Lord.
As Gurmukh, my mind is pleased with the Lord.
My diseases are cured, and my pains are taken away. ||3||
There is no other medicine, Tantric charm or mantra.
Meditative remembrance upon the Lord, Har, Har, destroys sins.
You Yourself cause us to stray from the path, and forget the Naam.
Showering Your Mercy, You Yourself save us. ||4||
The mind is diseased with doubt, superstition and duality.
Without the Guru, it dwells in doubt, and contemplates duality.
The Guru reveals the Darshan, the Blessed Vision of the Primal Lord.
Without the Word of the Guru's Shabad, what use is human life? ||5||
Beholding the marvelous Lord, I am wonder-struck and astonished.
In each and every heart, of the angels and holy men, He dwells in celestial Samaadhi.
I have enshrined the All-pervading Lord within my mind.
There is no one else equal to You. ||6||
For the sake of devotional worship, we chant Your Name.
The Lord's devotees dwell in the Society of the Saints.
Breaking his bonds, one comes to meditate on the Lord.
The Gurmukhs are emancipated, by the Guru-given knowledge of the Lord. ||7||
The Messenger of Death cannot touch him with pain;
the Lord's humble servant remains awake to the Love of the Naam.
The Lord is the Lover of His devotees; He dwells with His devotees.
O Nanak, they are liberated, through the Love of the Lord. ||8||9||
Aasaa, First Mehl, Ik-Tukee:
One who serves the Guru, knows his Lord and Master.
His pains are erased, and he realizes the True Word of the Shabad. ||1||
Meditate on the Lord, O my friends and companions.
Serving the True Guru, you shall behold God with your eyes. ||1||Pause||
People are entangled with mother, father and the world.
They are entangled with sons, daughters and spouses. ||2||
They are entangled with religious rituals, and religious faith, acting in ego.
They are entangled with sons, wives and others in their minds. ||3||
The farmers are entangled by farming.
People suffer punishment in ego, and the Lord King exacts the penalty from them. ||4||
They are entangled in trade without contemplation.
They are not satisfied by attachment to the expanse of Maya. ||5||
They are entangled with that wealth, amassed by bankers.
Without devotion to the Lord, they do not become acceptable. ||6||
They are entangled with the Vedas, religious discussions and egotism.
They are entangled, and perish in attachment and corruption. ||7||
Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord's Name.
One who is saved by the True Guru, does not suffer entanglement. ||8||10||
