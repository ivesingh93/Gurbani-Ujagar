One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:
Raag Parbhaatee Bibhaas, First Mehl, Chau-Padas, First House:
Your Name carries us across; Your Name brings respect and worship.
Your Name embellishes us; it is the object of the awakened mind.
Your Name brings honor to everyone's name.
Without Your Name, no one is ever respected. ||1||
All other clever tricks are just for show.
Whoever the Lord blesses with forgiveness - his affairs are perfectly resolved. ||1||Pause||
Your Name is my strength; Your Name is my support.
Your Name is my army; Your Name is my king.
Your Name brings honor, glory and approval.
By Your Grace, one is blessed with the banner and the insignia of Your Mercy. ||2||
Your Name brings intuitive peace and poise; Your Name brings praise.
Your Name is the Ambrosial Nectar which cleans out the poison.
Through Your Name, all peace and comfort comes to abide in the mind.
Without the Name, they are bound and gagged, and dragged off to the City of Death. ||3||
Man is involved with his wife, hearth and home, land and country,
the pleasures of the mind and fine clothes;
but when the call comes, he cannot delay.
O Nanak, in the end, the false turn out to be false. ||4||1||
Prabhaatee, First Mehl:
Your Name is the Jewel, and Your Grace is the Light. In awareness, there is Your Light.
Darkness fills the dark, and then everything is lost. ||1||
This whole world is corrupt.
Your Name is the only cure; nothing else works, O Infinite Creator Lord. ||1||Pause||
One side of the scale holds tens of thousands, millions of nether regions and realms.
O my Beloved, Your Worth could only be estimated if something else could be placed on the other side of the scale. ||2||
