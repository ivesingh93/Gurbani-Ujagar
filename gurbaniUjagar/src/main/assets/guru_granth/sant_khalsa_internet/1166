Here, take Naam Dayv's weight in gold, and release him."||10||
The king replied, "If I take the gold, then I will be consigned to hell,
by forsaking my faith and gathering worldly wealth."||11||
With his feet in chains, Naam Dayv kept the beat with his hands,
singing the Praises of the Lord. ||12||
Even if the Ganges and the Jamunaa rivers flow backwards,
I will still continue singing the Praises of the Lord."||13||
Three hours passed,
and even then, the Lord of the three worlds had not come. ||14||
Playing on the instrument of the feathered wings,
the Lord of the Universe came, mounted on the eagle garura. ||15||
He cherished His devotee,
and the Lord came, mounted on the eagle garura. ||16||
The Lord said to him, "If you wish, I shall turn the earth sideways.
If you wish, I shall turn it upside down. ||17||
If you wish, I shall bring the dead cow back to life.
Everyone will see and be convinced."||18||
Naam Dayv prayed, and milked the cow.
He brought the calf to the cow, and milked her. ||19||
When the pitcher was filled with milk,
Naam Dayv took it and placed it before the king. ||20||
The king went into his palace,
and his heart was troubled. ||21||
Through the Qazis and the Mullahs, the king offered his prayer,
Forgive me, please, O Hindu; I am just a cow before you.||22||
Naam Dayv said, "Listen, O king:
have I done this miracle? ||23||
The purpose of this miracle is
that you, O king, should walk on the path of truth and humility."||24||
Naam Dayv became famous everywhere for this.
The Hindus all went together to Naam Dayv. ||25||
If the cow had not been revived,
people would have lost faith in Naam Dayv. ||26||
The fame of Naam Dayv spread throughout the world.
The humble devotees were saved and carried across with him. ||27||
All sorts of troubles and pains afflicted the slanderer.
There is no difference between Naam Dayv and the Lord. ||28||1||10||
