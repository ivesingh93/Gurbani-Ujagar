O Nanak, attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Lord, they are detached, in the perfect balance of Nirvaanaa. ||4||13||33||
Gauree Gwaarayree, Third Mehl:
Through great good fortune and high destiny, one meets the True Guru.
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is constantly within the heart, and one enjoys the sublime essence of the Lord. ||1||
O mortal, become Gurmukh, and meditate on the Name of the Lord.
Be victorious in the game of life, and earn the profit of the Naam. ||1||Pause||
Spiritual wisdom and meditation come to those unto whom the Word of the Guru's Shabad is sweet.
By Guru's Grace, a few have tasted, and seen it. ||2||
They may perform all sorts of religious rituals and good actions,
but without the Name, the egotistical ones are cursed and doomed. ||3||
They are bound and gagged, and hung by Maya's noose;
O servant Nanak, they shall be released only by Guru's Grace. ||4||14||34||
Third Mehl, Gauree Bairaagan:
The clouds pour their rain down upon the earth, but isn't there water within the earth as well?
Water is contained within the earth; without feet, the clouds run around and let down their rain. ||1||
O Baba, get rid of your doubts like this.
As you act, so shall you become, and so you shall go and mingle. ||1||Pause||
As woman or man, what can anyone do?
The many and various forms are always Yours, O Lord; they shall merge again into You. ||2||
In countless incarnations, I went astray. Now that I have found You, I shall no longer wander.
It is His work; those who are absorbed in the Word of the Guru's Shabad come to know it well. ||3||
The Shabad is Yours; You are Yourself. Where is there any doubt?
O Nanak, one whose essence is merged with the Lord's essence does not have to enter the cycle of reincarnation again. ||4||1||15||35||
Gauree Bairaagan, Third Mehl:
The whole world is under the power of Death, bound by the love of duality.
The self-willed manmukhs do their deeds in ego; they receive their just rewards. ||1||
O my mind, focus your consciousness on the Guru's Feet.
As Gurmukh, you shall be awarded the treasure of the Naam. In the Court of the Lord, you shall be saved. ||1||Pause||
Through 8.4 million incarnations, people wander lost; in stubborn-mindedness, they come and go.
They do not realize the Word of the Guru's Shabad; they are reincarnated over and over again. ||2||
The Gurmukh understands his own self. The Lord's Name comes to dwell within the mind.
Imbued with devotion to the Lord's Name, night and day, he merges in peace. ||3||
When one's mind dies in the Shabad, one radiates faith and confidence, shedding egotism and corruption.
O servant Nanak, through the karma of good actions, the treasure of devotional worship and the Name of the Lord are attained. ||4||2||16||36||
Gauree Bairaagan, Third Mehl:
The Lord, Har, Har, has ordained that the soul is to stay in her parents' home for only a few short days.
Glorious is that soul-bride, who as Gurmukh, sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
She who cultivates virtue in her parents' home, shall obtain a home at her in-laws.
The Gurmukhs are intuitively absorbed into the Lord. The Lord is pleasing to their minds. ||1||
Our Husband Lord dwells in this world, and in the world beyond. Tell me, how can He be found?
The Immaculate Lord Himself is unseen. He unites us with Himself. ||1||Pause||
