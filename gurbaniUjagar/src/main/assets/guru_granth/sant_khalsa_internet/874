Gond:
I am restless and unhappy.
Without her calf, the cow is lonely. ||1||
Without water, the fish writhes in pain.
So is poor Naam Dayv without the Lord's Name. ||1||Pause||
Like the cow's calf, which, when let loose,
sucks at her udders and drinks her milk -||2||
So has Naam Dayv found the Lord.
Meeting the Guru, I have seen the Unseen Lord. ||3||
As the man driven by sex wants another man's wife,
so does Naam Dayv love the Lord. ||4||
As the earth burns in the dazzling sunlight,
so does poor Naam Dayv burn without the Lord's Name. ||5||4||
Raag Gond, The Word Of Naam Dayv Jee, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, all doubts are dispelled.
Chanting the Name of the Lord is the highest religion.
Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, erases social classes and ancestral pedigrees.
The Lord is the walking stick of the blind. ||1||
I bow to the Lord, I humbly bow to the Lord.
Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, you will not be tormented by the Messenger of Death. ||1||Pause||
The Lord took the life of Harnaakhash,
and gave Ajaamal a place in heaven.
Teaching a parrot to speak the Lord's Name, Ganika the prostitute was saved.
That Lord is the light of my eyes. ||2||
Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Pootna was saved,
even though she was a deceitful child-killer.
Contemplating the Lord, Dropadi was saved.
Gautam's wife, turned to stone, was saved. ||3||
The Lord, who killed Kaysee and Kans,
gave the gift of life to Kali.
Prays Naam Dayv, such is my Lord;
meditating on Him, fear and suffering are dispelled. ||4||1||5||
Gond:
One who chases after the god Bhairau, evil spirits and the goddess of smallpox,
is riding on a donkey, kicking up the dust. ||1||
I take only the Name of the One Lord.
I have given away all other gods in exchange for Him. ||1||Pause||
That man who chants "Shiva, Shiva", and meditates on him,
is riding on a bull, shaking a tambourine. ||2||
One who worships the Great Goddess Maya
will be reincarnated as a woman, and not a man. ||3||
You are called the Primal Goddess.
At the time of liberation, where will you hide then? ||4||
Follow the Guru's Teachings, and hold tight to the Lord's Name, O friend.
Thus prays Naam Dayv, and so says the Gita as well. ||5||2||6||
Bilaaval Gond:
Today, Naam Dayv saw the Lord, and so I will instruct the ignorant. ||Pause||
O Pandit, O religious scholar, your Gayatri was grazing in the fields.
Taking a stick, the farmer broke its leg, and now it walks with a limp. ||1||
O Pandit, I saw your great god Shiva, riding along on a white bull.
In the merchant's house, a banquet was prepared for him - he killed the merchant's son. ||2||
