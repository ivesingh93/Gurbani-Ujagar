but you do not experience the state of victory of the Lord of the Universe. ||3||
So enter the Sanctuary of the All-powerful, Unfathomable Lord and Master.
O God, O Searcher of hearts, please, save Nanak! ||4||27||33||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
Cross over the terrifying world-ocean in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
Remember in meditation the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, the source of jewels. ||1||
Remembering, remembering the Lord in meditation, I live.
All pain, disease and suffering is dispelled, meeting the Perfect Guru; sin has been eradicated. ||1||Pause||
The immortal status is obtained through the Name of the Lord;
the mind and body become spotless and pure, which is the true purpose of life. ||2||
Twenty-four hours a day, meditate on the Supreme Lord God.
By pre-ordained destiny, the Name is obtained. ||3||
I have entered His Sanctuary, and I meditate on the Lord, Merciful to the meek.
Nanak longs for the dust of the Saints. ||4||28||34||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
The beautiful one does not know the work of his own home.
The fool is engrossed in false attachments. ||1||
As You attach us, so we are attached.
When You bless us with Your Name, we chant it. ||1||Pause||
The Lord's slaves are imbued with the Love of the Lord.
They are intoxicated with the Lord, night and day. ||2||
Reaching out to grasp hold of our arms, God lifts us up.
Separated for countless incarnations, we are united with Him again. ||3||
Save me, O God, O my Lord and Master - shower me with Your Mercy.
Slave Nanak seeks Sanctuary at Your Door, O Lord. ||4||29||35||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
By the Grace of the Saints, I have found my eternal home.
I have found total peace, and I shall not waver again. ||1||
I meditate on the Guru, and the Lord's Feet, within my mind.
In this way, the Creator Lord has made me steady and stable. ||1||Pause||
I sing the Glorious Praises of the unchanging, eternal Lord God,
and the noose of death is snapped. ||2||
Showering His Mercy, he has attached me to the hem of His robe.
In constant bliss, Nanak sings His Glorious Praises. ||3||30||36||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
The Words, the Teachings of the Holy Saints, are Ambrosial Nectar.
Whoever meditates on the Lord's Name is emancipated; he chants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, with his tongue. ||1||Pause||
The pains and sufferings of the Dark Age of Kali Yuga are eradicated,
when the One Name abides within the mind. ||1||
I apply the dust of the feet of the Holy to my face and forehead.
Nanak has been saved, in the Sanctuary of the Guru, the Lord. ||2||31||37||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl: Third House:
I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe, the Merciful Lord.
Please, bless me with the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, O Perfect, Compassionate Lord. ||Pause||
Please, grant Your Grace, and cherish me.
My soul and body are all Your property. ||1||
Only meditation on the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, will go along with you.
Nanak begs for the dust of the Saints. ||2||32||38||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
Without Him, there is no other at all.
The True Lord Himself is our anchor. ||1||
The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is our only support.
The Creator, the Cause of causes, is All-powerful and Infinite. ||1||Pause||
He has eradicated all illness, and healed me.
O Nanak, He Himself has become my Savior. ||2||33||39||
