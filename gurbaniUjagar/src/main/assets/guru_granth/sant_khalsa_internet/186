When I opened it up and gazed upon the treasures of my father and grandfather,
then my mind became very happy. ||1||
Overflowing with priceless jewels and rubies,
the storehouse is inexhaustible and immeasurable. ||2||
The Siblings of Destiny meet together, and eat and spend,
but these resources do not diminish; they continue to increase. ||3||
Says Nanak, one who has such destiny written on his forehead,
becomes a partner in these treasures. ||4||31||100||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
I was scared, scared to death, when I thought that He was far away.
But my fear was removed, when I saw that He is pervading everywhere. ||1||
I am a sacrifice to my True Guru.
He shall not abandon me; He shall surely carry me across. ||1||Pause||
Pain, disease and sorrow come when one forgets the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Eternal bliss comes when one sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||2||
Do not say that anyone is good or bad.
Renounce your arrogant pride, and grasp the Feet of the Lord. ||3||
Says Nanak, remember the GurMantra;
you shall find peace at the True Court. ||4||32||101||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Those who have the Lord as their Friend and Companion -
tell me, what else do they need? ||1||
Those who are in love with the Lord of the Universe -
pain, suffering and doubt run away from them. ||1||Pause||
Those who have enjoyed the flavor of the Lord's sublime essence
are not attracted to any other pleasures. ||2||
Those whose speech is accepted in the Court of the Lord -
what do they care about anything else? ||3||
Those who belong to the One, unto whom all things belong -
O Nanak, they find a lasting peace. ||4||33||102||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Those who look alike upon pleasure and pain -
how can anxiety touch them? ||1||
The Lord's Holy Saints abide in celestial bliss.
They remain obedient to the Lord, the Sovereign Lord King. ||1||Pause||
Those who have the Carefree Lord abiding in their minds -
no cares will ever bother them. ||2||
Those who have banished doubt from their minds
are not afraid of death at all. ||3||
Those whose hearts are filled with the Lord's Name by the Guru, -
says Nanak, all treasures come to them. ||4||34||103||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
The Lord of Unfathomable Form has His Place in the mind.
By Guru's Grace, a rare few come to understand this. ||1||
The Ambrosial Pools of the celestial sermon -
those who find them, drink them in. ||1||Pause||
The unstruck melody of the Guru's Bani vibrates in that most special place.
The Lord of the World is fascinated with this melody. ||2||
The numerous, countless places of celestial peace -
there, the Saints dwell, in the Company of the Supreme Lord God. ||3||
There is infinite joy, and no sorrow or duality.
The Guru has blessed Nanak with this home. ||4||35||104||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
What form of Yours should I worship and adore?
What Yoga should I practice to control my body? ||1||
