Chant the Praises of the Lord; Kali Yuga has come.
The justice of the previous three ages is gone. One obtains virtue, only if the Lord bestows it. ||1||Pause||
In this turbulent age of Kali Yuga, Muslim law decides the cases, and the blue-robed Qazi is the judge.
The Guru's Bani has taken the place of Brahma's Veda, and the singing of the Lord's Praises are good deeds. ||5||
Worship without faith; self-discipline without truthfulness; the ritual of the sacred thread without chastity - what good are these?
You may bathe and wash, and apply a ritualistic tilak mark to your forehead, but without inner purity, there is no understanding. ||6||
In Kali Yuga, the Koran and the Bible have become famous.
The Pandit's scriptures and the Puraanas are not respected.
O Nanak, the Lord's Name now is Rehmaan, the Merciful.
Know that there is only One Creator of the creation. ||7||
Nanak has obtained the glorious greatness of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. There is no action higher than this.
If someone goes out to beg for what is already in his own home, then he should be chastised. ||8||1||
Raamkalee, First Mehl:
You preach to the world, and set up your house.
Abandoning your Yogic postures, how will you find the True Lord?
You are attached to possessiveness and the love of sexual pleasure.
You are not a renunciate, nor a man of the world. ||1||
Yogi, remain seated, and the pain of duality will run away from you.
You beg from door to door, and you don't feel ashamed. ||1||Pause||
You sing the songs, but you do not understand your own self.
How will the burning pain within be relieved?
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, let your mind be absorbed in the Lord's Love,
and you will intuitively experience the charity of contemplation. ||2||
You apply ashes to your body, while acting in hypocrisy.
Attached to Maya, you will be beaten by Death's heavy club.
Your begging bowl is broken; it will not hold the charity of the Lord's Love.
Bound in bondage, you come and go. ||3||
You do not control your seed and semen, and yet you claim to practice abstinence.
You beg from Maya, lured by the three qualities.
You have no compassion; the Lord's Light does not shine in you.
You are drowned, drowned in worldly entanglements. ||4||
You wear religious robes, and your patched coat assumes many disguises.
You play all sorts of false tricks, like a juggler.
The fire of anxiety burns brightly within you.
Without the karma of good actions, how can you cross over? ||5||
You make ear-rings of glass to wear in your ears.
But liberation does not come from learning without understanding.
You are lured by the tastes of the tongue and sex organs.
You have become a beast; this sign cannot be erased. ||6||
The people of the world are entangled in the three modes; the Yogis are entangled in the three modes.
Contemplating the Word of the Shabad, sorrows are dispelled.
Through the Shabad, one becomes radiant, pure and truthful.
One who contemplates the true lifestyle is a Yogi. ||7||
The nine treasures are with You, Lord; You are potent, the Cause of causes.
You establish and disestablish; whatever You do, happens.
One who practices celibacy, chastity, self-control, truth and pure consciousness -
O Nanak, that Yogi is the friend of the three worlds. ||8||2||
Raamkalee, First Mehl:
Above the six chakras of the body dwells the detached mind.
Awareness of the vibration of the Word of the Shabad has been awakened deep within.
The unstruck melody of the sound current resonates and resounds within; my mind is attuned to it.
Through the Guru's Teachings, my faith is confirmed in the True Name. ||1||
O mortal, through devotion to the Lord, peace is obtained.
The Lord, Har, Har, seems sweet to the Gurmukh, who merges in the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||Pause||
