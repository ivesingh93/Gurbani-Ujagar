where the servants of the Lord of the World abide.
God, the Lord of the World, is pleased and satisfied with me.
My disharmony with Him of so many lifetimes is ended. ||5||
Burnt offerings, sacred feasts, intense meditations with the body upside-down, worship services
and taking millions of cleansing baths at sacred shrines of pilgrimage
- the merits of all these are obtained by enshrining the Lord's Lotus Feet within the heart, even for an instant.
Meditating on the Lord of the Universe, all one's affairs are resolved. ||6||
God's Place is the highest of the high.
The Lord's humble servants intuitively focus their meditation on Him.
I long for the dust of the slaves of the Lord's slaves.
My Beloved Lord is overflowing with all powers. ||7||
My Beloved Lord, my Mother and Father, is always near.
O my Friend and Companion, You are my Trusted Support.
God takes His slaves by the hand, and makes them His Own.
Nanak lives by meditating on the Lord, the Treasure of Virtue. ||8||3||2||7||12||
Bibhaas, Prabhaatee, The Word Of Devotee Kabeer Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
My anxious fears of death and rebirth have been taken away.
The Celestial Lord has shown His Love for me. ||1||
The Divine Light has dawned, and darkness has been dispelled.
Contemplating the Lord, I have obtained the Jewel of His Name. ||1||Pause||
Pain runs far away from that place where there is bliss.
The jewel of the mind is focused and attuned to the essence of reality. ||2||
Whatever happens is by the Pleasure of Your Will.
Whoever understands this, is intuitively merged in the Lord. ||3||
Says Kabeer, my sins have been obliterated.
My mind has merged into the Lord, the Life of the World. ||4||1||
Prabhaatee:
If the Lord Allah lives only in the mosque, then to whom does the rest of the world belong?
According to the Hindus, the Lord's Name abides in the idol, but there is no truth in either of these claims. ||1||
O Allah, O Raam, I live by Your Name.
Please show mercy to me, O Master. ||1||Pause||
The God of the Hindus lives in the southern lands, and the God of the Muslims lives in the west.
So search in your heart - look deep into your heart of hearts; this is the home and the place where God lives. ||2||
The Brahmins observe twenty-four fasts during the year, and the Muslims fast during the month of Ramadaan.
The Muslims set aside eleven months, and claim that the treasure is only in the one month. ||3||
What is the use of bathing at Orissa? Why do the Muslims bow their heads in the mosque?
If someone has deception in his heart, what good is it for him to utter prayers? And what good is it for him to go on pilgrimage to Mecca? ||4||
You fashioned all these men and women, Lord. All these are Your Forms.
Kabeer is the child of God, Allah, Raam. All the Gurus and prophets are mine. ||5||
Says Kabeer, listen, O men and women: seek the Sanctuary of the One.
Chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, O mortals, and you shall surely be carried across. ||6||2||
Prabhaatee:
First, Allah created the Light; then, by His Creative Power, He made all mortal beings.
From the One Light, the entire universe welled up. So who is good, and who is bad? ||1||
