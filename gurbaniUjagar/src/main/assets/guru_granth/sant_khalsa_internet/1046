There is only One Command, and there is only One Supreme King. In each and every age, He links each to their tasks. ||1||
That humble being is immaculate, who knows his own self.
The Lord, the Giver of peace, Himself comes and meets him.
His tongue is imbued with the Shabad, and he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord; he is honored in the Court of the True Lord. ||2||
The Gurmukh is blessed with the glorious greatness of the Naam.
The self-willed manmukh, the slanderer, loses his honor.
Attuned to the Naam, the supreme soul-swans remain detached; in the home of the self, they remain absorbed in deep meditative trance. ||3||
That humble being who dies in the Shabad is perfect.
The brave, heroic True Guru chants and proclaims this.
Deep within the body is the true pool of Ambrosial Nectar; the mind drinks it in with loving devotion. ||4||
The Pandit, the religious scholar, reads and instructs others,
but he does not realize that his own home is on fire.
Without serving the True Guru, the Naam is not obtained. You can read until you are exhausted, but you shall not find peace and tranquility. ||5||
Some smear their bodies with ashes, and wander around in religious disguises.
Without the Word of the Shabad, who has ever subdued egotism?
Night and day, they continue burning, day and night; they are deluded and confused by their doubt and religious costumes. ||6||
Some, in the midst of their household and family, remain always unattached.
They dIE in the Shabad, and dwell in the Lord's Name.
Night and day, they remain forever attuned to His Love; they focus their consciousness on loving devotion and the Fear of God. ||7||
The self-willed manmukh indulges in slander, and is ruined.
The dog of greed barks within him.
The Messenger of Death never leaves him, and in the end, he leaves, regretting and repenting. ||8||
Through the True Word of the Shabad, true honor is obtained.
Without the Name, no one attains liberation.
Without the True Guru, no one finds the Name. Such is the making which God has made. ||9||
Some are Siddhas and seekers, and great contemplators.
Some remain imbued with the Naam, the Name of the Formless Lord, day and night.
He alone understands, whom the Lord unites with Himself; through loving devotional worship, fear is dispelled. ||10||
Some take cleansing baths and give donations to charities, but they do not understand.
Some struggle with their minds, and conquer and subdue their minds.
Some are imbued with love for the True Word of the Shabad; they merge with the True Shabad. ||11||
He Himself creates and bestows glorious greatness.
By the Pleasure of His Will, He bestows union.
Bestowing His Grace, He comes to dwell in the mind; such is the Command ordained by my God. ||12||
Those humble beings who serve the True Guru are true.
The false, self-willed manmukhs do not know how to serve the Guru.
The Creator Himself creates the creation and watches over it; he attaches all according to the Pleasure of His Will. ||13||
In each and every age, the True Lord is the one and only Giver.
Through perfect destiny, one realizes the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Those who are immersed in the Shabad are not separated again. By His Grace, they are intuitively immersed in the Lord. ||14||
Acting in egotism, they are stained with the filth of Maya.
They dIE and dIE again, only to be reborn in the love of duality.
Without serving the True Guru, no one finds liberation. O mind, tune into this, and see. ||15||
