The greatest sins, and millions of pains and diseases are destroyed by Your Gracious Glance, O God.
While sleeping and waking, Nanak sings the Lord's Name, Har, Har, Har; he falls at the Guru's feet. ||2||8||
Dayv-Gandhaaree, Fifth Mehl:
I have seen that God with my eyes everywhere.
The Giver of peace, the Giver of souls, His Speech is Ambrosial Nectar. ||1||Pause||
The Saints dispel the darkness of ignorance; the Guru is the Giver of the gift of life.
Granting His Grace, the Lord has made me His own; I was on fire, but now I am cooled. ||1||
The karma of good deeds, and the Dharma of righteous faith, have not been produced in me, in the least; nor has pure conduct welled up in me.
Renouncing cleverness and self-mortification, O Nanak, I fall at the Guru's feet. ||2||9||
Dayv-Gandhaaree, Fifth Mehl:
Chant the Lord's Name, and earn the profit.
You shall attain salvation, peace, poise and bliss, and the noose of Death shall be cut away. ||1||Pause||
Searching, searching, searching and reflecting, I have found that the Lord's Name is with the Saints.
They alone obtain this treasure, who have such pre-ordained destiny. ||1||
They are very fortunate and honorable; they are the perfect bankers.
They are beautiful, so very wise and handsome; O Nanak, purchase the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||2||10||
Dayv-Gandhaaree, Fifth Mehl:
O mind, why are you so puffed up with egotism?
Whatever is seen in this foul, impure and filthy world, is only ashes. ||1||Pause||
Remember the One who created you, O mortal; He is the Support of your soul, and the breath of life.
One who forsakes Him, and attaches himself to another, dies to be reborn; he is such an ignorant fool! ||1||
I am blind, mute, crippled and totally lacking in understanding; O God, Preserver of all, please preserve me!
The Creator, the Cause of causes is all-powerful; O Nanak, how helpless are His beings! ||2||11||
Dayv-Gandhaaree, Fifth Mehl:
God is the nearest of the near.
Remember Him, meditate on Him, and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe, day and night, evening and morning. ||1||Pause||
Redeem your body in the invaluable Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
Do not delay for an instant, even for a moment. Death is keeping you constantly in his vision. ||1||
Lift me up out of the dark dungeon, O Creator Lord; what is there which is not in Your home?
Bless Nanak with the Support of Your Name, that he may find great happiness and peace. ||2||12|| Chhakaa 1||
Dayv-Gandhaaree, Fifth Mehl:
O mind, meet with the Guru, and worship the Naam in adoration.
You shall obtain peace, poise, bliss, joy and pleasure, and lay the foundation of eternal life. ||1||Pause||
Showing His Mercy, the Lord has made me His slave, and shattered the bonds of Maya.
Through loving devotion, and singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe, I have escaped the Path of Death. ||1||
When he became Merciful, the rust was removed, and I found the priceless treasure.
O Nanak, I am a sacrifice, a hundred thousand times, to my unapproachable, unfathomable Lord and Master. ||2||13||
