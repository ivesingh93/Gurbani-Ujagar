Without the Guru, there is only pitch darkness.
Meeting with the True Guru, one is emancipated. ||2||
All the deeds done in egotism,
are just chains around the neck.
Harboring self-conceit and self-interest
is just like placing chains around one's ankles.
He alone meets with the Guru, and realizes the One Lord,
who has such destiny written on his forehead. ||3||
He alone meets the Lord, who is pleasing to His Mind.
He alone is deluded, who is deluded by God.
No one, by himself, is ignorant or wise.
He alone chants the Naam, whom the Lord inspires to do so.
You have no end or limitation.
Servant Nanak is forever a sacrifice to You. ||4||1||17||
Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:
Maya, the enticer, has enticed the world of the three gunas, the three qualities.
The false world is engrossed in greed.
Crying out, "Mine, mine!" they collect possessions, but in the end, they are all deceived. ||1||
The Lord is fearless, formless and merciful.
He is the Cherisher of all beings and creatures. ||1||Pause||
Some collect wealth, and bury it in the ground.
Some cannot abandon wealth, even in their dreams.
The king exercises his power, and fills his money-bags, but this fickle companion will not go along with him. ||2||
Some love this wealth even more than their body and breath of life.
Some collect it, forsaking their fathers and mothers.
Some hide it from their children, friends and siblings, but it will not remain with them. ||3||
Some become hermits, and sit in meditative trances.
Some are Yogis, celibates, religious scholars and thinkers.
Some dwell in homes, graveyards, cremation grounds and forests; but Maya still clings to them there. ||4||
When the Lord and Master releases one from his bonds,
the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, comes to dwell in his soul.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, His humble servants are liberated; O Nanak, they are redeemed and enraptured by the Lord's Glance of Grace. ||5||2||18||
Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:
Meditate in remembrance on the One Immaculate Lord.
No one is turned away from Him empty-handed.
He cherished and preserved you in your mother's womb;
He blessed you with body and soul, and embellished you.
Each and every instant, meditate on that Creator Lord.
Meditating in remembrance on Him, all faults and mistakes are covered.
Enshrine the Lord's lotus feet deep within the nucleus of your self.
Save your soul from the waters of corruption.
Your cries and shrieks shall be ended;
meditating on the Lord of the Universe, your doubts and fears shall be dispelled.
Rare is that being, who finds the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
Nanak is a sacrifice, a sacrifice to Him. ||1||
The Lord's Name is the support of my mind and body.
Whoever meditates on Him is emancipated. ||1||Pause||
He believes that the false thing is true.
The ignorant fool falls in love with it.
He is intoxicated with the wine of sexual desire, anger and greed;
he loses this human life in exchange for a mere shell.
He abandons his own, and loves that of others.
His mind and body are permeated with the intoxication of Maya.
His thirsty desires are not quenched, although he indulges in pleasures.
His hopes are not fulfilled, and all his words are false.
He comes alone, and he goes alone.
