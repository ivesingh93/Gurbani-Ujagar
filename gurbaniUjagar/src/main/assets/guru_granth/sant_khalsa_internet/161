In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, no one is interested in good karma, or Dharmic faith.
This Dark Age was born in the house of evil.
O Nanak, without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, no one is liberated. ||4||10||30||
Gauree, Third Mehl, Gwaarayree:
True is the Lord King, True is His Royal Command.
Those whose minds are attuned to the True, Carefree Lord,
enter the True Mansion of His Presence, and merge in the True Name. ||1||
Listen, O my mind: contemplate the Word of the Shabad.
Chant the Lord's Name, and cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||Pause||
In doubt he comes, and in doubt he goes.
This world is born out of the love of duality.
The self-willed manmukh does not remember the Lord; he continues coming and going in reincarnation. ||2||
Does he himself go astray, or does God lead him astray?
This soul is enjoined to the service of someone else.
It earns only terrible pain, and this life is lost in vain. ||3||
Granting His Grace, He leads us to meet the True Guru.
Remembering the One Name, doubt is cast out from within.
O Nanak, chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the nine treasures of the Name are obtained. ||4||11||31||
Gauree Gwaarayree, Third Mehl:
Go and ask the Gurmukhs, who meditate on the Lord.
Serving the Guru, the mind is satisfied.
Those who earn the Lord's Name are wealthy.
Through the Perfect Guru, understanding is obtained. ||1||
Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my Siblings of Destiny.
The Gurmukhs serve the Lord, and so they are accepted. ||1||Pause||
Those who recognize the self - their minds become pure.
They become Jivan-mukta, liberated while yet alive, and they find the Lord.
Singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, the intellect becomes pure and sublime,
and they are easily and intuitively absorbed in the Lord. ||2||
In the love of duality, no one can serve the Lord.
In egotism and Maya, they are eating toxic poison.
They are emotionally attached to their children, family and home.
The blind, self-willed manmukhs come and go in reincarnation. ||3||
Those, unto whom the Lord bestows His Name,
worship Him night and day, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
How rare are those who understand the Guru's Teachings!
O Nanak, they are absorbed in the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||12||32||
Gauree Gwaarayree, Third Mehl:
The Guru's service has been performed throughout the four ages.
Very few are those perfect ones who do this good deed.
The wealth of the Lord's Name is inexhaustible; it shall never be exhausted.
In this world, it brings a constant peace, and at the Lord's Gate, it brings honor. ||1||
O my mind, have no doubt about this.
Those Gurmukhs who serve, drink in the Ambrosial Nectar. ||1||Pause||
Those who serve the True Guru are the greatest people of the world.
They save themselves, and they redeem all their generations as well.
They keep the Name of the Lord clasped tightly to their hearts.
Attuned to the Naam, they cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||2||
Serving the True Guru, the mind becomes humble forever.
Egotism is subdued, and the heart-lotus blossoms forth.
The Unstruck Melody vibrates, as they dwell within the home of the self.
Attuned to the Naam, they remain detached within their own home. ||3||
Serving the True Guru, their words are true.
Throughout the ages, the devotees chant and repeat these words.
Night and day, they meditate on the Lord, the Sustainer of the Earth.
