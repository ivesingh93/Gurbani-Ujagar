Maaroo, First Mehl:
I am Your slave, Your bonded servant, and so I am called fortunate.
I sold myself at Your store in exchange for the Guru's Word; whatever You link me to, to that I am linked. ||1||
What cleverness can Your servant try with You?
O my Lord and Master, I cannot carry out the Hukam of Your Command. ||1||Pause||
My mother is Your slave, and my father is Your slave; I am the child of Your slaves.
My slave mother dances, and my slave father sings; I practice devotional worship to You, O my Sovereign Lord. ||2||
If You wish to drink, then I shall get water for You; if You wish to eat, I shall grind the corn for You.
I wave the fan over You, and wash Your feet, and continue to chant Your Name. ||3||
I have been untrue to myself, but Nanak is Your slave; please forgive him, by Your glorious greatness.
Since the very beginning of time, and throughout the ages, You have been the merciful and generous Lord. Without You, liberation cannot be attained. ||4||6||
Maaroo, First Mehl:
Some call him a ghost; some say that he is a demon.
Some call him a mere mortal; O, poor Nanak! ||1||
Crazy Nanak has gone insane, after his Lord, the King.
I know of none other than the Lord. ||1||Pause||
He alone is known to be insane, when he goes insane with the Fear of God.
He recognizes none other than the One Lord and Master. ||2||
He alone is known to be insane, if he works for the One Lord.
Recognizing the Hukam, the Command of his Lord and Master, what other cleverness is there? ||3||
He alone is known to be insane, when he falls in love with his Lord and Master.
He sees himself as bad, and all the rest of the world as good. ||4||7||
Maaroo, First Mehl:
This wealth is all-pervading, permeating all.
The self-willed manmukh wanders around, thinking that it is far away. ||1||
That commodity, the wealth of the Naam, is within my heart.
Whoever You bless with it, is emancipated. ||1||Pause||
This wealth does not burn; it cannot be stolen by a thief.
This wealth does not drown, and its owner is never punished. ||2||
Gaze upon the glorious greatness of this wealth,
and your nights and days will pass, imbued with celestial peace. ||3||
Listen to this incomparably beautiful story, O my brothers, O Siblings of Destiny.
Tell me, without this wealth, who has ever obtained the supreme status? ||4||
Nanak humbly prays, I proclaim the Unspoken Speech of the Lord.
If one meets the True Guru, then this wealth is obtained. ||5||8||
Maaroo, First Mehl:
Heat up the sun energy of the right nostril, and cool down the moon energy of the left nostril; practicing this breath-control, bring them into perfect balance.
In this way, the fickle fish of the mind will be held steady; the swan-soul shall not fly away, and the body-wall will not crumble. ||1||
You fool, why are you deluded by doubt?
You do not remember the detached Lord of supreme bliss. ||1||Pause||
Seize and burn the unbearable; seize and kill the imperishable; leave behind your doubts, and then, you shall drink in the Nectar.
In this way, the fickle fish of the mind will be held steady; the swan-soul shall not fly away, and the body-wall shall not crumble. ||2||
