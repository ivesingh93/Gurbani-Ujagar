My heart lotus blossoms forth in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; I have renounced evil-mindedness and intellectualism. ||2||
One who sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, twenty-four hours a day, and remembers the Lord in meditation, who is Kind to the poor,
saves himself, and redeems all his generations; all of his bonds are released. ||3||
I take the Support of Your Feet, O God, O Lord and Master; you are with me through and through, God.
Nanak has entered Your Sanctuary, God; giving him His hand, the Lord has protected him. ||4||2||32||
Goojaree, Ashtapadees, First Mehl, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
In the one village of the body, live the five thieves; they have been warned, but they still go out stealing.
One who keeps his assets safe from the three modes and the ten passions, O Nanak, attains liberation and emancipation. ||1||
Center your mind on the all-pervading Lord, the Wearer of garlands of the jungles.
Let your rosary be the chanting of the Lord's Name in your heart. ||1||Pause||
Its roots extend upwards, and its branches reach down; the four Vedas are attached to it.
He alone reaches this tree with ease, O Nanak, who remains wakeful in the Love of the Supreme Lord God. ||2||
The Elysian Tree is the courtyard of my house; in it are the flowers, leaves and stems of reality.
Meditate on the self-existent, immaculate Lord, whose Light is pervading everywhere; renounce all your worldly entanglements. ||3||
Listen, O seekers of Truth - Nanak begs you to renounce the traps of Maya.
Reflect within your mind, that by enshrining love for the One Lord, you shall not be subject to birth and death again. ||4||
He alone is said to be a Guru, he alone is said to be a Sikh, and he alone is said to be a physician, who knows the patient's illness.
He is not affected by actions, responsibilities and entanglements; in the entanglements of his household, he maintains the detachment of Yoga. ||5||
He renounces sexual desire, anger, egotism, greed, attachment and Maya.
Within his mind, he meditates on the reality of the Imperishable Lord; by Guru's Grace he finds Him. ||6||
Spiritual wisdom and meditation are all said to be God's gifts; all of the demons are turned white before him.
He enjoys the taste of the honey of God's lotus; he remains awake, and does not fall asleep. ||7||
This lotus is very deep; its leaves are the nether regions, and it is connected to the whole universe.
Under Guru's Instruction, I shall not have to enter the womb again; I have renounced the poison of corruption, and I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar. ||8||1||
Goojaree, First Mehl:
Those who beg of God the Great Giver - their numbers cannot be counted.
You, Almighty True Lord, fulfill the desires within their hearts. ||1||
O Dear Lord, chanting, deep meditation, self-discipline and truth are my foundations.
Bless me with Your Name, Lord, that I may find peace. Your devotional worship is a treasure over-flowing. ||1||Pause||
Some remain absorbed in Samaadhi, their minds fixed lovingly on the One Lord; they reflect only on the Word of the Shabad.
In that state, there is no water, land, earth or sky; only the Creator Lord Himself exists. ||2||
There is no intoxication of Maya there, and no shadow, nor the infinite light of the sun or the moon.
The eyes within the mind which see everything - with one glance, they see the three worlds. ||3||
