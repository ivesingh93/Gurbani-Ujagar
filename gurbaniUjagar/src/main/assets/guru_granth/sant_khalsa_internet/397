They escape from the great noose of death; they are permeated with the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||2||
How can I chant the Glorious Praises of the Guru? The Guru is the ocean of Truth and clear understanding.
He is the Perfect Transcendent Lord, from the very beginning, and throughout the ages. ||3||
Meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, forever and ever, my mind is filled with the Love of the Lord, Har, Har.
The Guru is my soul, my breath of life, and wealth; O Nanak, He is with me forever. ||4||2||104||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
If the Invisible and Infinite Lord dwells within my mind, even for a moment,
then all my pains, troubles, and diseases vanish. ||1||
I am a sacrifice to my Lord Master.
Meditating on Him, a great joy wells up within my mind and body. ||1||Pause||
I have heard only a little bit of news about the True Lord Master.
I have obtained the peace of all peace, O my mother; I cannot estimate its worth. ||2||
He is so beautiful to my eyes; beholding Him, I have been bewitched.
I am worthless, O my mother; He Himself has attached me to the hem of His robe. ||3||
He is beyond the world of the Vedas, the Koran and the Bible.
The Supreme King of Nanak is immanent and manifest. ||4||3||105||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Tens of thousands of devotees worship and adore You, chanting, "Beloved, Beloved".
How shall You unite me, the worthless and corrupt soul, with Yourself. ||1||
You are my Support, O Merciful God, Lord of the Universe, Sustainer of the World.
You are the Master of all; the entire creation is Yours. ||1||Pause||
You are the constant help and support of the Saints, who behold You Ever-present.
Those who lack the Naam, the Name of the Lord, shall die, engulfed in sorrow and pain. ||2||
Those servants, who lovingly perform the Lord's service, are freed from the cycle of reincarnation.
What shall be the fate of those who forget the Naam? ||3||
As are the cattle which have strayed, so is the entire world.
O God, please cut away Nanak's bonds, and unite him with Yourself. ||4||4||106||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Forget all other things, and dwell upon the Lord alone.
Lay aside your false pride, and dedicate your mind and body to Him. ||1||
Twenty-four hours a day, praise the Creator Lord.
I live by Your bountiful gifts - please, shower me with Your Mercy! ||1||Pause||
So, do that work, by which your face shall be made radiant.
He alone becomes attached to the Truth, O Lord, unto whom You give it. ||2||
So build and adorn that house, which shall never be destroyed.
Enshrine the One Lord within your consciousness; He shall never die. ||3||
The Lord is dear to those, who are pleasing to the Will of God.
By Guru's Grace, Nanak describes the indescribable. ||4||5||107||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
What are they like - those who do not forget the Naam, the Name of the Lord?
Know that there is absolutely no difference; they are exactly like the Lord. ||1||
The mind and body are enraptured, meeting with You, O Lord.
Peace is obtained, by the favor of the Lord's humble servant; all pains are taken away. ||1||Pause||
As many as are the continents of the world, so many have been saved.
Those, in whose minds You Yourself dwell, O Lord, are the perfect devotees. ||2||
