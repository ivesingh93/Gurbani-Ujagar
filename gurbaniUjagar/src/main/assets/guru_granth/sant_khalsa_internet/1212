Says Nanak, gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, I have found peace, and all my hopes have been fulfilled. ||2||15||38||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
The most beautiful path for the feet is to follow the Lord of the Universe.
The more you walk on any other path, the more you suffer in pain. ||1||Pause||
The eyes are sanctified, gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan. Serving Him, the hands are sanctified.
The heart is sanctified, when the Lord abides within the heart; that forehead which touches the dust of the feet of the Saints is sanctified. ||1||
All treasures are in the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; he alone obtains it, who has it written in his karma.
Servant Nanak has met with the Perfect Guru; he passes his life-night in peace, poise and pleasure. ||2||16||39||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; at the very last instant, it shall be your Help and Support.
In that place where your mother, father, children and siblings shall be of no use to you at all, there, the Name alone shall save you. ||1||Pause||
He alone meditates on the Lord in the deep dark pit of his own household, upon whose forehead such destiny is written.
His bonds are loosened, and the Guru liberates him. He sees You, O Lord, everywhere. ||1||
Drinking in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam, his mind is satisfied. Tasting it, his tongue is satiated.
Says Nanak, I have obtained celestial peace and poise; the Guru has quenched all my thirst. ||2||17||40||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Meeting the Guru, I meditate on God in such a way,
that He has become kind and compassionate to me. He is the Destroyer of pain; He does not allow the hot wind to even touch me. ||1||Pause||
With each and every breath I take, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
He is not separated from me, even for an instant, and I never forget Him. He is always with me, wherever I go. ||1||
I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice to His Lotus Feet. I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan.
Says Nanak, I do not care about anything else; I have found the Lord, the Ocean of peace. ||2||18||41||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
The Word of the Guru's Shabad seems so sweet to my mind.
My karma has been activated, and the Divine Radiance of the Lord, Har, Har, is manifest in each and every heart. ||1||Pause||
The Supreme Lord God, beyond birth, Self-existent, is seated within every heart everywhere.
I have come to obtain the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to the Lotus Feet of God. ||1||
I anoint my forehead with the dust of the Society of the Saints; it is as if I have bathed at all the sacred shrines of pilgrimage.
Says Nanak, I am dyed in the deep crimson color of His Love; the Love of my Lord shall never fade away. ||2||19||42||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
The Guru has given me the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, as my Companion.
If the Word of God dwells within my heart for even an instant, all my hunger is relieved. ||1||Pause||
O Treasure of Mercy, Master of Excellence, my Lord and Master, Ocean of peace, Lord of all.
My hopes rest in You alone, O my Lord and Master; hope in anything else is useless. ||1||
My eyes were satisfied and fulfilled, gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, when the Guru placed His Hand on my forehead.
