Abandon your Yogic postures and breath control exercises, O madman.
Renounce fraud and deception, and meditate continuously on the Lord, O madman. ||1||Pause||
That which you beg for, has been enjoyed in the three worlds.
Says Kabeer, the Lord is the only Yogi in the world. ||2||8||
Bilaaval:
This Maya has made me forget Your feet, O Lord of the World, Master of the Universe.
Not even a bit of love wells up in Your humble servant; what can Your poor servant do? ||1||Pause||
Cursed is the body, cursed is the wealth, and cursed is this Maya; cursed, cursed is the clever intellect and understanding.
Restrain and hold back this Maya; overcome it, through the Word of the Guru's Teachings. ||1||
What good is farming, and what good is trading? Worldly entanglements and pride are false.
Says Kabeer, in the end, they are ruined; ultimately, Death will come for them. ||2||9||
Bilaaval:
Within the pool of the body, there is an incomparably beautiful lotus flower.
Within it, is the Supreme Light, the Supreme Soul, who has no feature or form. ||1||
O my mind, vibrate, meditate on the Lord, and forsake your doubt. The Lord is the Life of the World. ||1||Pause||
Nothing is seen coming into the world, and nothing is seen leaving it.
Where the body is born, there it dies, like the leaves of the water-lily. ||2||
Maya is false and transitory; forsaking it, one obtains peaceful, celestial contemplation.
Says Kabeer, serve Him within your mind; He is the Enemy of ego, the Destroyer of demons. ||3||10||
Bilaaval:
The illusion of birth and death is gone; I lovingly focus on the Lord of the Universe.
In my life, I am absorbed in deep silent meditation; the Guru's Teachings have awakened me. ||1||Pause||
The sound made from bronze, that sound goes into the bronze again.
But when the bronze is broken, O Pandit, O religious scholar, where does the sound go then? ||1||
I gaze upon the world, the confluence of the three qualities; God is awake and aware in each and every heart.
Such is the understanding revealed to me; within my heart, I have become a detached renunciate. ||2||
I have come to know my own self, and my light has merged in the Light.
Says Kabeer, now I know the Lord of the Universe, and my mind is satisfied. ||3||11||
Bilaaval:
When Your Lotus Feet dwell within one's heart, why should that person waver, O Divine Lord?
I know that all comforts, and the nine treasures, come to one who intuitively, naturally, chants the Praise of the Divine Lord. ||Pause||
Such wisdom comes, only when one sees the Lord in all, and unties the knot of hypocrisy.
Time and time again, he must hold himself back from Maya; let him take the scale of the Lord, and weigh his mind. ||1||
Then wherever he goes, he will find peace, and Maya will not shake him.
Says Kabeer, my mind believes in the Lord; I am absorbed in the Love of the Divine Lord. ||2||12||
Bilaaval, The Word Of Devotee Naam Dayv Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The Guru has made my life fruitful.
