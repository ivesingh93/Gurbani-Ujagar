The strings and wires of the musical instrument are worn out, and I am in the power of the Lord's Name. ||1||
Now, I no longer dance to the tune.
My mind no longer beats the drum. ||1||Pause||
I have burnt away sexual desire, anger and attachment to Maya, and the pitcher of my desires has burst.
The gown of sensuous pleasures is worn out, and all my doubts have been dispelled. ||2||
I look upon all beings alike, and my conflict and strife are ended.
Says Kabeer, when the Lord showed His Favor, I obtained Him, the Perfect One. ||3||6||28||
Aasaa:
You keep your fasts to please Allah, while you murder other beings for pleasure.
You look after your own interests, and so not see the interests of others. What good is your word? ||1||
O Qazi, the One Lord is within you, but you do not behold Him by thought or contemplation.
You do not care for others, you are a religious fanatic, and your life is of no account at all. ||1||Pause||
Your holy scriptures say that Allah is True, and that he is neither male nor female.
But you gain nothing by reading and studying, O mad-man, if you do not gain the understanding in your heart. ||2||
Allah is hidden in every heart; reflect upon this in your mind.
The One Lord is within both Hindu and Muslim; Kabeer proclaims this out loud. ||3||7||29||
Aasaa, Ti-Pada, Ik-Tuka:
I have decorated myself to meet my Husband Lord.
But the Lord, the Life of the Word, the Sustainer of the Universe, has not come to meet me. ||1||
The Lord is my Husband, and I am the Lord's bride.
The Lord is so great, and I am infinitesimally small. ||1||Pause||
The bride and the Groom dwell together.
They lIE upon the one bed, but their union is difficult. ||2||
Blessed is the soul-bride, who is pleasing to her Husband Lord.
Says Kabeer, she shall not have to be reincarnated again. ||3||8||30||
Aasaa Of Kabeer Jee, Du-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
When the Diamond of the Lord pierces the diamond of my mind, the fickle mind waving in the wind is easily absorbed into Him.
This Diamond fills all with Divine Light; through the True Guru's Teachings, I have found Him. ||1||
The sermon of the Lord is the unstruck, endless song.
Becoming a swan, one recognizes the Diamond of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Says Kabeer, I have seen such a Diamond, permeating and pervading the world.
The hidden diamond became visible, when the Guru revealed it to me. ||2||1||31||
Aasaa:
My first wife, ignorance, was ugly, of low social status and bad character; she was evil in my home, and in her parents' home.
My present bride, divine understanding, is beautiful, wise and well-behaved; I have taken her to my heart. ||1||
It has turned out so well, that my first wife has died.
May she, whom I have now married, live throughout the ages. ||1||Pause||
Says Kabeer, when the younger bride came, the elder one lost her husband.
The younger bride is with me now, and the elder one has taken another husband. ||2||2||32||
Aasaa:
