He Himself forgives, and implants the Truth. The mind and body are then attuned to the True Lord. ||11||
Within the polluted mind and body is the Light of the Infinite Lord.
One who understands the Guru's Teachings, contemplates this.
Conquering egotism, the mind becomes immaculate forever; with his tongue, he serves the Lord, the Giver of peace. ||12||
In the fortress of the body there are many shops and bazaars;
within them is the Naam, the Name of the utterly infinite Lord.
In His Court, one is embellished forever with the Word of the Guru's Shabad; he conquers egotism and realizes the Lord. ||13||
The jewel is priceless, inaccessible and infinite.
How can the poor wretch estimate its worth?
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, it is weighed, and so the Shabad is realized deep within. ||14||
The great volumes of the Simritees and the Shaastras,
only extend the extension of attachment to Maya.
The fools read them, but do not understand the Word of the Shabad. How rare are those who, as Gurmukh, understand. ||15||
The Creator Himself acts, and causes all to act.
Through the True Word of His Bani, Truth is implanted deep within.
O Nanak, through the Naam, one is blessed with glorious greatness, and throughout the ages, the One Lord is known. ||16||9||
Maaroo, Third Mehl:
Serve the True Creator Lord.
The Word of the Shabad is the Destroyer of pain.
He is inaccessible and unfathomable; He cannot be evaluated. He Himself is inaccessible and immeasurable. ||1||
The True Lord Himself makes Truth pervasive.
He attaches some humble beings to the Truth.
They serve the True Lord and practice Truth; through the Name, they are absorbed in the True Lord. ||2||
The Primal Lord unites His devotees in His Union.
He attaches them to true devotional worship.
One who sings forever the Glorious Praises of the Lord, through the True Word of His Bani, earns the profit of this life. ||3||
The Gurmukh trades, and understands his own self.
He knows no other than the One Lord.
True is the banker, and True are His traders, who buy the merchandise of the Naam. ||4||
He Himself fashions and creates the Universe.
He inspires a few to realize the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Those humble beings who serve the True Guru are true. He snaps the noose of death from around their necks. ||5||
He destroys, creates, embellishes and fashions all beings,
and attaches them to duality, attachment and Maya.
The self-willed manmukhs wander around forever, acting blindly. Death has strung his noose around their necks. ||6||
He Himself forgives, and enjoins us to serve the Guru.
Through the Guru's Teachings, the Naam comes to dwell within the mind.
Night and day, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the True Lord, and earn the profit of the Naam in this world. ||7||
He Himself is True, and True is His Name.
The Gurmukh bestows it, and enshrines it within the mind.
Noble and exalted are those, within whose mind the Lord abides. Their heads are free of strife. ||8||
He is inaccessible and unfathomable; His value cannot be appraised.
By Guru's Grace, He dwells within the mind.
No one calls that person to account, who praises the Word of the Shabad, the Giver of virtue. ||9||
Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva serve Him.
Even they cannot find the limits of the unseen, unknowable Lord.
Those who are blessed by Your Glance of Grace, become Gurmukh, and comprehend the incomprehensible. ||10||
