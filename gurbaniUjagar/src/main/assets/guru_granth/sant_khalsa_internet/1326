My mind and body are calm and tranquil; the disease has been cured, and now I sleep in peace. ||3||
As the rays of the sun spread out everywhere, the Lord pervades each and every heart.
Meeting the Holy Saint, one drinks in the Sublime Essence of the Lord; sitting in the home of your own inner being, drink in the essence. ||4||
The humble being is in love with the Guru, like the chakvi bird which loves to see the sun.
She watches, and keeps on watching all through the night; and when the sun shows its face, she drinks in the Amrit. ||5||
The faithless cynic is said to be very greedy - he is a dog. He is overflowing with the filth and pollution of evil-mindedness.
He talks excessively about his own interests. How can he be trusted? ||6||
I have sought the Sanctuary of the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; I have found the Sublime Essence of the Lord.
They do good deeds for others, and speak of the Lord's many Glorious Virtues; please bless me to meet these Saints, these devotees of the Lord. ||7||
You are the Inaccessible Lord, Kind and Compassionate, the Great Giver; please shower us with Your Mercy, and save us.
You are the Life of all the beings of the world; please cherish and sustain Nanak. ||8||5||
Kalyaan, Fourth Mehl:
O Lord, please make me the slave of Your slaves.
As long as there is breath deep within my mind, let me drink in the dust of the Holy. ||1||Pause||
Shiva, Naarad, the thousand-headed cobra king and the silent sages long for the dust of the Holy.
All the worlds and realms where the Holy place their feet are sanctified. ||1||
So let go of your shame and renounce all your egotism; join with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and remain there.
Give up your fear of the Righteous Judge of Dharma, and you shall be lifted up and saved from drowning in the sea of poison. ||2||
Some are standing, parched and shriveled up by their doubts; joining the Saadh Sangat, they are rejuvenated.
So do not delay, even for an instant - go and fall at the feet of the Holy. ||3||
The Kirtan of the Praise of the Lord's Name is a priceless jewel. The Lord has given it for the Holy to keep.
Whoever accepts and follows the Word of the Guru's Teachings as True - this Jewel is taken out and given to him. ||4||
Listen, O Saints; listen, humble Siblings of Destiny: the Guru raises His Arms and sends out the call.
If you long for everlasting peace and comfort for your soul, then enter the Sanctuary of the True Guru. ||5||
If you have great good fortune and are very noble, then implant the Guru's Teachings and the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within.
Emotional attachment to Maya is totally treacherous; drinking in the Sublime Essence of the Lord, you shall easily, intuitively cross over the world-ocean. ||6||
Those who are totally in love with Maya, Maya, shall rot away in Maya.
The path of ignorance and darkness is utterly treacherous; they are loaded down with the crushing load of egotism. ||7||
O Nanak, chanting the Name of the Lord, the All-pervading Lord, one is emancipated.
Meeting the True Guru, the Naam is implanted within; we are united and blended with the Lord's Name. ||8||6|| One Chhakaa||
