Your consciousness shall become immaculate and pure.
All the misfortunes of your mind and body shall be taken away,
and all your pain and darkness will be dispelled. ||1||
Singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, cross over the world-ocean.
By great good fortune, one attains the Infinite Lord, the Primal Being. ||1||Pause||
One who sings the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises,
the Messenger of Death cannot even touch that humble being.
His coming into this world is approved,
as the Gurmukh realizes his Lord and Master. ||2||
He sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, by the Grace of the Saints;
his sexual desire, anger and madness are eradicated.
He knows the Lord God to be ever-present.
This is the Perfect Teaching of the Perfect Guru. ||3||
He earns the treasure of the Lord's wealth.
Meeting with the True Guru, all his affairs are resolved.
He is awake and aware in the Love of the Lord's Name;
O Nanak, his mind is attached to the Lord's Feet. ||4||14||16||
Gond, Fifth Mehl:
The Lord's Feet are the boat to cross over the terrifying world-ocean.
Meditating in remembrance on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he does not die again.
Chanting the Glorious Praises of the Lord, he does not have to walk on the Path of Death.
Contemplating the Supreme Lord, the five demons are conquered. ||1||
I have entered Your Sanctuary, O Perfect Lord and Master.
Please give Your hand to Your creatures. ||1||Pause||
The Simritees, Shaastras, Vedas and Puraanas
expound upon the Supreme Lord God.
The Yogis, celibates, Vaishnavs and followers of Ram Das
cannot find the limits of the Eternal Lord God. ||2||
Shiva and the gods lament and moan,
but they do not understand even a tiny bit of the unseen and unknown Lord.
One whom the Lord Himself blesses with loving devotional worship,
is very rare in this world. ||3||
I am worthless, with absolutely no virtue at all;
all treasures are in Your Glance of Grace.
Nanak, the meek, desires only to serve You.
Please be merciful, and grant him this blessing, O Divine Guru. ||4||15||17||
Gond, Fifth Mehl:
One who is cursed by the Saints, is thrown down on the ground.
The slanderer of the Saints is thrown down from the skies.
I hold the Saints close to my soul.
The Saints are saved instantaneously. ||1||
He alone is a Saint, who is pleasing to the Lord.
The Saints, and God, have only one job to do. ||1||Pause||
God gives His hand to shelter the Saints.
He dwells with His Saints, day and night.
With each and every breath, He cherishes His Saints.
He takes the power away from the enemies of the Saints. ||2||
Let no one slander the Saints.
Whoever slanders them, will be destroyed.
One who is protected by the Creator Lord,
cannot be harmed, no matter how much the whole world may try. ||3||
I place my faith in my God.
My soul and body all belong to Him.
This is the faith which inspires Nanak:
the self-willed manmukhs will fail, while the Gurmukhs will always win. ||4||16||18||
Gond, Fifth Mehl:
The Name of the Immaculate Lord is the Ambrosial Water.
Chanting it with the tongue, sins are washed away. ||1||Pause||
