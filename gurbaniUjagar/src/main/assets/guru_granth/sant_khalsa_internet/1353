You believed that this body was permanent, but it shall turn to dust.
Why don't you chant the Name of the Lord, you shameless fool? ||1||
Let devotional worship of the Lord enter into your heart, and abandon the intellectualism of your mind.
O Servant Nanak, this is the way to live in the world. ||2||4||
One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:
Shalok Sehskritee, First Mehl:
You study the scriptures, say your prayers and argue;
you worship stones and sit like a crane, pretending to meditate.
You speak lies and well-ornamented falsehood,
and recite your daily prayers three times a day.
The mala is around your neck, and the sacred tilak mark is on your forehead.
You wear two loin cloths, and keep your head covered.
If you know God and the nature of karma,
you know that all these rituals and beliefs are useless.
Says Nanak, meditate on the Lord with faith.
Without the True Guru, no one finds the Way. ||1||
The mortal's life is fruitless, as long as he does not know God.
Only a few, by Guru's Grace, cross over the world-ocean.
The Creator, the Cause of causes, is All-powerful. Thus speaks Nanak, after deep deliberation.
The Creation is under the control of the Creator. By His Power, He sustains and supports it. ||2||
The Shabad is Yoga, the Shabad is spiritual wisdom; the Shabad is the Vedas for the Brahmin.
The Shabad is heroic bravery for the Kshatriya; the Shabad is service to others for the Soodra.
The Shabad for all is the Shabad, the Word of the One God, for one who knows this secret.
Nanak is the slave of the Divine, Immaculate Lord. ||3||
The One Lord is the Divinity of all divinities and he is the Divinity of the soul;
if any one knows the mystery of the soul and the Omnipresent Lord.
Nanak is the slave of that one who knows the Secrets of the soul and the Supreme Lord God. He is the Divine Immaculate Lord Himself. ||4||
Shalok Sehskritee, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:
Who is the mother, and who is the father? Who is the son, and what is the pleasure of marriage?
Who is the brother, friend, companion and relative? Who is emotionally attached to the family?
Who is restlessly attached to beauty? It leaves, as soon as we see it.
Only the meditative remembrance of God remains with us. O Nanak, it brings the blessings of the Saints, the sons of the Imperishable Lord. ||1||
