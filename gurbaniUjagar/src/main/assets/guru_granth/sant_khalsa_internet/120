Subduing their desires, they merge with the True One;
they see in their minds that everyone comes and goes in reincarnation.
Serving the True Guru, they become stable forever, and they obtain their dwelling in the home of the self. ||3||
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Lord is seen within one's own heart.
Through the Shabad, I have burned my emotional attachment to Maya.
I gaze upon the Truest of the True, and I praise Him. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I obtain the True One. ||4||
Those who are attuned to Truth are blessed with the Love of the True One.
Those who praise the Lord's Name are very fortunate.
Through the Word of His Shabad, the True One blends with Himself, those who join the True Congregation and sing the Glorious Praises of the True One. ||5||
We could read the account of the Lord, if He were in any account.
He is Inaccessible and Incomprehensible; through the Shabad, understanding is obtained.
Night and day, praise the True Word of the Shabad. There is no other way to know His Worth. ||6||
People read and recite until they grow weary, but they do not find peace.
Consumed by desire, they have no understanding at all.
They purchase poison, and they are thirsty with their fascination for poison. Telling lies, they eat poison. ||7||
By Guru's Grace, I know the One.
Subduing my sense of duality, my mind is absorbed into the True One.
O Nanak, the One Name is pervading deep within my mind; by Guru's Grace, I receive it. ||8||17||18||
Maajh, Third Mehl:
In all colors and forms, You are pervading.
People die over and over again; they are re-born, and make their rounds on the wheel of reincarnation.
You alone are Eternal and Unchanging, Inaccessible and Infinite. Through the Guru's Teachings, understanding is imparted. ||1||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who enshrine the Lord's Name in their minds.
The Lord has no form, features or color. Through the Guru's Teachings, He inspires us to understand Him. ||1||Pause||
The One Light is all-pervading; only a few know this.
Serving the True Guru, this is revealed.
In the hidden and in the obvious, He is pervading all places. Our light merges into the Light. ||2||
The world is burning in the fire of desire,
in greed, arrogance and excessive ego.
People die over and over again; they are re-born, and lose their honor. They waste away their lives in vain. ||3||
Those who understand the Word of the Guru's Shabad are very rare.
Those who subdue their egotism, come to know the three worlds.
Then, they die, never to die again. They are intuitively absorbed in the True One. ||4||
They do not focus their consciousness on Maya again.
They remain absorbed forever in the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
They praise the True One, who is contained deep within all hearts. They are blessed and exalted by the Truest of the True. ||5||
Praise the True One, who is Ever-present.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, He is pervading everywhere.
By Guru's Grace, we come to behold the True One; from the True One, peace is obtained. ||6||
The True One permeates and pervades the mind within.
The True One is Eternal and Unchanging; He does not come and go in reincarnation.
Those who are attached to the True One are immaculate and pure. Through the Guru's Teachings, they merge in the True One. ||7||
Praise the True One, and no other.
Serving Him, eternal peace is obtained.
