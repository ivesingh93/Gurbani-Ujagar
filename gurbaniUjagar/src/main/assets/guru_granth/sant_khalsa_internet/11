You are constant in each and every heart, and in all things. O Dear Lord, you are the One.
Some are givers, and some are beggars. This is all Your Wondrous Play.
You Yourself are the Giver, and You Yourself are the Enjoyer. I know no other than You.
You are the Supreme Lord God, Limitless and Infinite. What Virtues of Yours can I speak of and describe?
Unto those who serve You, unto those who serve You, Dear Lord, servant Nanak is a sacrifice. ||2||
Those who meditate on You, Lord, those who meditate on You-those humble beings dwell in peace in this world.
They are liberated, they are liberated-those who meditate on the Lord. For them, the noose of death is cut away.
Those who meditate on the Fearless One, on the Fearless Lord-all their fears are dispelled.
Those who serve, those who serve my Dear Lord, are absorbed into the Being of the Lord, Har, Har.
Blessed are they, blessed are they, who meditate on their Dear Lord. Servant Nanak is a sacrifice to them. ||3||
Devotion to You, devotion to You, is a treasure overflowing, infinite and beyond measure.
Your devotees, Your devotees praise You, Dear Lord, in many and various and countless ways.
For You, many, for You, so very many perform worship services, O Dear Infinite Lord; they practice disciplined meditation and chant endlessly.
For You, many, for You, so very many read the various Simritees and Shaastras. They perform rituals and religious rites.
Those devotees, those devotees are sublime, O servant Nanak, who are pleasing to my Dear Lord God. ||4||
You are the Primal Being, the Most Wonderful Creator. There is no other as Great as You.
Age after age, You are the One. Forever and ever, You are the One. You never change, O Creator Lord.
Everything happens according to Your Will. You Yourself accomplish all that occurs.
You Yourself created the entire universe, and having fashioned it, You Yourself shall destroy it all.
Servant Nanak sings the Glorious Praises of the Dear Creator, the Knower of all. ||5||1||
Aasaa, Fourth Mehl:
You are the True Creator, my Lord and Master.
Whatever pleases You comes to pass. As You give, so do we receive. ||1||Pause||
All belong to You, all meditate on you.
Those who are blessed with Your Mercy obtain the Jewel of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
The Gurmukhs obtain it, and the self-willed manmukhs lose it.
You Yourself separate them from Yourself, and You Yourself reunite with them again. ||1||
You are the River of Life; all are within You.
There is no one except You.
All living beings are Your playthings.
The separated ones meet, and by great good fortune, those suffering in separation are reunited once again. ||2||
They alone understand, whom You inspire to understand;
they continually chant and repeat the Lord's Praises.
Those who serve You find peace.
They are intuitively absorbed into the Lord's Name. ||3||
