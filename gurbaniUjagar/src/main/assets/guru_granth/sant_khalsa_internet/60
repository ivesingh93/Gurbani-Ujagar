O mind, how can you be saved without love?
God permeates the inner beings of the Gurmukhs. They are blessed with the treasure of devotion. ||1||Pause||
O mind, love the Lord, as the fish loves the water.
The more the water, the more the happiness, and the greater the peace of mind and body.
Without water, she cannot live, even for an instant. God knows the suffering of her mind. ||2||
O mind, love the Lord, as the song-bird loves the rain.
The pools are overflowing with water, and the land is luxuriantly green, but what are they to her, if that single drop of rain does not fall into her mouth?
By His Grace, she receives it; otherwise, because of her past actions, she gives her head. ||3||
O mind, love the Lord, as the water loves the milk.
The water, added to the milk, itself bears the heat, and prevents the milk from burning.
God unites the separated ones with Himself again, and blesses them with true greatness. ||4||
O mind, love the Lord, as the chakvee duck loves the sun.
She does not sleep, for an instant or a moment; the sun is so far away, but she thinks that it is near.
Understanding does not come to the self-willed manmukh. But to the Gurmukh, the Lord is always close. ||5||
The self-willed manmukhs make their calculations and plans, but only the actions of the Creator come to pass.
His Value cannot be estimated, even though everyone may wish to do so.
Through the Guru's Teachings, it is revealed. Meeting with the True One, peace is found. ||6||
True love shall not be broken, if the True Guru is met.
Obtaining the wealth of spiritual wisdom, the understanding of the three worlds is acquired.
So become a customer of merit, and do not forget the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||7||
Those birds which peck at the shore of the pool have played and have departed.
In a moment, in an instant, we too must depart. Our play is only for today or tomorrow.
But those whom You unite, Lord, are united with You; they obtain a seat in the Arena of Truth. ||8||
Without the Guru, love does not well up, and the filth of egotism does not depart.
One who recognizes within himself that, "He is me", and who is pierced through by the Shabad, is satisfied.
When one becomes Gurmukh and realizes his own self, what more is there left to do or have done? ||9||
Why speak of union to those who are already united with the Lord? Receiving the Shabad, they are satisfied.
The self-willed manmukhs do not understand; separated from Him, they endure beatings.
O Nanak, there is only the one door to His Home; there is no other place at all. ||10||11||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
The self-willed manmukhs wander around, deluded and deceived. They find no place of rest.
Without the Guru, no one is shown the Way. Like the blind, they continue coming and going.
Having lost the treasure of spiritual wisdom, they depart, defrauded and plundered. ||1||
O Baba, Maya deceives with its illusion.
Deceived by doubt, the discarded bride is not received into the Lap of her Beloved. ||1||Pause||
The deceived bride wanders around in foreign lands; she leaves, and abandons her own home.
Deceived, she climbs the plateaus and mountains; her mind wavers in doubt.
Separated from the Primal Being, how can she meet with Him again? Plundered by pride, she cries out and bewails. ||2||
The Guru unites the separated ones with the Lord again, through the love of the Delicious Name of the Lord.
