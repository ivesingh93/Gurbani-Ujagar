O Dear Lord, the Messenger of Death cannot even touch those whom You, in Your Mercy, protect. ||2||
True Is Your Sanctuary, O Dear Lord; it never diminishes or goes away.
Those who abandon the Lord, and become attached to the love of duality, shall continue to die and be reborn. ||3||
Those who seek Your Sanctuary, Dear Lord, shall never suffer in pain or hunger for anything.
O Nanak, praise the Naam, the Name of the Lord forever, and merge in the True Word of the Shabad. ||4||4||
Prabhaatee, Third Mehl:
As Gurmukh, meditate on the Dear Lord forever, as long as there is the breath of life.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the mind becomes immaculate, and egotistical pride is expelled from the mind.
Fruitful and prosperous is the life of that mortal being, who is absorbed in the Name of the Lord. ||1||
O my mind, listen to the Teachings of the Guru.
The Name of the Lord is the Giver of peace forever. With intuitive ease, drink in the Sublime Essence of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Those who understand their own origin dwell within the home of their inner being, in intuitive peace and poise.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the heart-lotus blossoms forth, and egotism and evil-mindedness are eradicated.
The One True Lord is pervading amongst all; those who realize this are very rare. ||2||
Through the Guru's Teachings, the mind becomes immaculate, speaking the Ambrosial Essence.
The Name of the Lord dwells in the mind forever; within the mind, the mind is pleased and appeased.
I am forever a sacrifice to my Guru, through whom I have realized the Lord, the Supreme Soul. ||3||
Those human beings who do not serve the True Guru - their lives are uselessly wasted.
When God bestows His Glance of Grace, then we meet the True Guru, merging in intuitive peace and poise.
O Nanak, by great good fortune, the Naam is bestowed; by perfect destiny, meditate. ||4||5||
Prabhaatee, Third Mehl:
God Himself fashioned the many forms and colors; He created the Universe and staged the play.
Creating the creation, He watches over it. He acts, and causes all to act; He gives sustenance to all beings. ||1||
In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Lord is All-pervading.
The One God is pervading and permeating each and every heart; the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is revealed to the Gurmukh. ||1||Pause||
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is hidden, but it is pervasive in the Dark Age. The Lord is totally pervading and permeating each and every heart.
The Jewel of the Naam is revealed within the hearts of those who hurry to the Sanctuary of the Guru. ||2||
Whoever overpowers the five sense organs, is blessed with forgiveness, patience and contentment, through the Guru's Teachings.
Blessed, blessed, perfect and great is that humble servant of the Lord, who is inspired by the Fear of God and detached love, to sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||3||
If someone turns his face away from the Guru, and does not enshrine the Guru's Words in his consciousness
- he may perform all sorts of rituals and accumulate wealth, but in the end, he will fall into hell. ||4||
The One Shabad, the Word of the One God, is prevailing everywhere. All the creation came from the One Lord.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh is united in union. When the Gurmukh goes, he blends into the Lord, Har, Har. ||5||6||
Prabhaatee, Third Mehl:
O my mind, praise your Guru.
