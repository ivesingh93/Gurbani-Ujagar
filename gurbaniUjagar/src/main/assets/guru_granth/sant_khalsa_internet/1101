Fifth Mehl:
Even if one were to enjoy all pleasures, and be master of the entire earth,
O Nanak, all of that is just a disease. Without the Naam, he is dead. ||2||
Fifth Mehl:
Yearn for the One Lord, and make Him your friend.
O Nanak, He alone fulfills your hopes; you should feel embarrassed, visiting other places. ||3||
Pauree:
The One and only Lord is eternal, imperishable, inaccessible and incomprehensible.
The treasure of the Naam is eternal and imperishable. Meditating in remembrance on Him, the Lord is attained.
The Kirtan of His Praises is eternal and imperishable; the Gurmukh sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe.
Truth, righteousness, Dharma and intense meditation are eternal and imperishable. Day and night, worship the Lord in adoration.
Compassion, righteousness, Dharma and intense meditation are eternal and imperishable; they alone obtain these, who have such pre-ordained destiny.
The inscription inscribed upon one's forehead is eternal and imperishable; it cannot be avoided by avoidance.
The Congregation, the Company of the Holy, and the word of the humble, are eternal and imperishable. The Holy Guru is eternal and imperishable.
Those who have such pre-ordained destiny worship and adore the Lord, forever and ever. ||19||
Shalok, Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:
One who himself has drowned - how can he carry anyone else across?
One who is imbued with the Love of the Husband Lord - O Nanak, he himself is saved, and he saves others as well. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
Wherever someone speaks and hears the Name of my Beloved Lord,
that is where I go, O Nanak, to see Him, and blossom forth in bliss. ||2||
Fifth Mehl:
You are in love with your children and your wife; why do you keep calling them your own?
O Nanak, without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the human body has no foundation. ||3||
Pauree:
With my eyes, I gaze upon the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan; I touch my forehead to the Guru's feet.
With my feet I walk on the Guru's Path; with my hands, I wave the fan over Him.
I meditate on Akaal Moorat, the undying form, within my heart; day and night, I meditate on Him.
I have given up all egoism, and have placed my faith in the all-powerful Guru.
The Guru has blessed me with the treasure of the Naam; I am rid of all sufferings.
Eat and enjoy the Naam, the Name of the indescribable Lord, O Siblings of Destiny.
Confirm your faith in the Naam, charity and self-purification; chant the Guru's sermon forever.
Blessed with intuitive poise, I have found God; I am rid of the fear of the Messenger of Death. ||20||
Shalok, Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:
I am centered and focused on my Beloved, but I am not satisfied, even by seeing Him.
The Lord and Master is within all; I do not see any other. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
The sayings of the Saints are the paths of peace.
O Nanak, they alone obtain them, upon whose foreheads such destiny is written. ||2||
Fifth Mehl:
He is totally permeating the mountains, oceans, deserts, lands, forests, orchards, caves,
the nether regions of the underworld, the Akaashic ethers of the skies, and all hearts.
Nanak sees that they are all strung on the same thread. ||3||
Pauree:
The Dear Lord is my mother, the Dear Lord is my father; the Dear Lord cherishes and nurtures me.
The Dear Lord takes care of me; I am the child of the Lord.
Slowly and steadily, He feeds me; He never fails.
He does not remind me of my faults; He hugs me close in His embrace.
Whatever I ask for, He give me; the Lord is my peace-giving father.
