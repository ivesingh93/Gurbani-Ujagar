Entangled in disease, they cannot stay still, even for an instant.
Without the True Guru, the disease is never cured. ||3||
When the Supreme Lord God grants His Mercy,
He grabs hold of the mortal's arm, and pulls him up and out of the disease.
Reaching the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the mortal's bonds are broken.
Says Nanak, the Guru cures him of the disease. ||4||7||20||

Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
The True Guru, the Primal Being, is free of revenge and hate; He is God, the Great Giver.
I am a sinner; You are my Forgiver.
That sinner, who finds no protection anywhere-
if he comes seeking Your Sanctuary, then he becomes immaculate and pure. ||1||
Pleasing the True Guru, I have found peace.
Meditating on the Guru, I have obtained all fruits and rewards. ||1||Pause||
I humbly bow to the Supreme Lord God, the True Guru.
My mind and body are Yours; all the world is Yours.
When the veil of illusion is removed, then I come to see You.
You are my Lord and Master; You are the King of all. ||2||
When it pleases Him, even dry wood becomes green.
When it pleases Him, rivers flow across the desert sands.
When it pleases Him, all fruits and rewards are obtained.
Grasping hold of the Guru's feet, my anxiety is dispelled. ||3||
