Goojaree, Fifth Mehl:
Show Mercy to me, and grant me the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. I sing Your Praises night and day.
With my hair, I wash the feet of Your slave; this is my life's purpose. ||1||
O Lord and Master, without You, there is no other at all.
O Lord, in my mind I remain conscious of You; with my tongue I worship You, and with my eyes, I gaze upon You. ||1||Pause||
O Merciful Lord, O Lord and Master of all, with my palms pressed together I pray to You.
Nanak, Your slave, chants Your Name, and is redeemed in the twinkling of an eye. ||2||11||20||
Goojaree, Fifth Mehl:
Overwhelming the realm of Brahma, the realm of Shiva and the realm of Indra, Maya has come running here.
But she cannot touch the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; she washes and massages their feet. ||1||
Now, I have come and entered the Lord's Sanctuary.
This awful fire has burned so many; the True Guru has cautioned me about it. ||1||Pause||
It clings to the necks of the Siddhas, and the seekers, the demi-gods, angels and mortals.
Servant Nanak has the support of God the Creator, who has millions of slaves like her. ||2||12||21||
Goojaree, Fifth Mehl:
His bad reputation is erased, he is acclaimed all over the world, and he obtains a seat in the Court of the Lord.
The fear of death is removed in an instant, and he goes to the Lord's House in peace and bliss. ||1||
His works do not go in vain.
Twenty-four hours a day, remember your God in meditation; meditate on Him continually in your mind and body. ||1||Pause||
I seek Your Sanctuary, O Destroyer of the pains of the poor; whatever You give me, God, that is what I receive.
Nanak is imbued with the love of Your lotus feet; O Lord, please preserve the honor of Your slave. ||2||13||22||
Goojaree, Fifth Mehl:
The all-sustaining Lord is the Giver of all beings; His devotional worship is an overflowing treasure.
Service to Him is not wasted; in an instant, He emancipates. ||1||
O my mind, immerse yourself in the Lord's lotus feet.
Seek from Him, who is worshipped by all beings. ||1||Pause||
Nanak has entered Your Sanctuary, O Creator Lord; You, O God, are the support of my breath of life.
He who is protected by You, O Helper Lord - what can the world do to him? ||2||14||23||
Goojaree, Fifth Mehl:
The Lord Himself has protected the honor of His humble servant.
The Guru has given the medicine of the Lord's Name, Har, Har, and all afflictions are gone. ||1||Pause||
The Transcendent Lord, in His Mercy, has preserved Har Gobind.
The disease is over, and there is joy all around; we ever contemplate the Glories of God. ||1||
My Creator Lord has made me His own; such is the glorious greatness of the Perfect Guru.
Guru Nanak laid the immovable foundation, which grows higher and higher each day. ||2||15||24||
Goojaree, Fifth Mehl:
You never focused your consciousness on the Lord.
