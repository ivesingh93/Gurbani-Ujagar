Nat, Fifth Mehl:
I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to the Guru, the Lord of the World. ||1||Pause||
I am unworthy; You are the Perfect Giver. You are the Merciful Master of the meek. ||1||
While standing up and sitting down, while sleeping and awake, You are my soul, my breath of life, my wealth and property. ||2||
Within my mind there is such a great thirst for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. Nanak is enraptured with Your Glance of Grace. ||3||8||9||
Nat Partaal, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Is there any friend or companion of mine,
who will constantly share the Lord's Name with me?
Will he rid me of my pains and evil tendencies?
I would surrender my mind, body, consciousness and everything. ||1||Pause||
How rare is that one whom the Lord makes His own,
and whose mind is sewn into the Lord's Lotus Feet.
Granting His Grace, the Lord blesses him with His Praise. ||1||
Vibrating, meditating on the Lord, he is victorious in this precious human life,
and millions of sinners are sanctified.
Slave Nanak is a sacrifice, a sacrifice to Him. ||2||1||10||19||
Nat Ashtapadees, Fourth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O Lord, Your Name is the support of my mind and body.
I cannot survive for a moment, even for an instant, without serving You. Following the Guru's Teachings, I dwell upon the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Within my mind, I meditate on the Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har, Har. The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is so dear to me.
When God, my Lord and Master, became merciful to me the meek one, I was exalted by the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||1||
Almighty Lord, Slayer of demons, Life of the World, my Lord and Master, inaccessible and infinite:
I offer this one prayer to the Guru, to bless me, that I may wash the feet of the Holy. ||2||
The thousands of eyes are the eyes of God; the One God, the Primal Being, remains unattached.
The One God, our Lord and Master, has thousands of forms; God alone, through the Guru's Teachings, saves us. ||3||
Following the Guru's Teachings, I have been blessed with the Naam, the Name of the Lord. I have enshrined within my heart the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
The sermon of the Lord, Har, Har, is so very sweet; like the mute, I taste its sweetness, but I cannot describe it at all. ||4||
The tongue savors the bland, insipid taste of the love of duality, greed and corruption.
The Gurmukh tastes the flavor of the Lord's Name, and all other tastes and flavors are forgotten. ||5||
Following the Guru's Teachings, I have obtained the wealth of the Lord's Name; hearing it, and chanting it, sins are eradicated.
The Messenger of Death and the Righteous Judge of Dharma do not even approach the beloved servant of my Lord and Master. ||6||
With as many breaths as I have, I chant the Naam, under Guru's Instructions.
Each and every breath which escapes me without the Naam - that breath is useless and corrupt. ||7||
Please grant Your Grace; I am meek; I seek Your Sanctuary, God. Unite me with Your beloved, humble servants.
