Raag Maaroo, The Word Of Jai Dayv Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The breath is drawn in through the left nostril; it is held in the central channel of the Sukhmanaa, and exhaled through the right nostril, repeating the Lord's Name sixteen times.
I am powerless; my power has been broken. My unstable mind has been stabilized, and my unadorned soul has been adorned. I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar. ||1||
Within my mind, I chant the Name of the Primal Lord God, the Source of virtue.
My vision, that You are I are separate, has melted away. ||1||Pause||
I worship the One who is worthy of being worshipped. I trust the One who is worthy of being trusted. Like water merging in water, I merge in the Lord.
Says Jai Dayv, I meditate and contemplate the Luminous, Triumphant Lord. I am lovingly absorbed in the Nirvaanaa of God. ||2||1||
Kabeer, Maaroo:
Meditate in remembrance on the Lord, or else you will regret it in the end, O mind.
O sinful soul, you act in greed, but today or tomorrow, you will have to get up and leave. ||1||Pause||
Clinging to greed, you have wasted your life, deluded in the doubt of Maya.
Do not take pride in your wealth and youth; you shall crumble apart like dry paper. ||1||
When the Messenger of Death comes and grabs you by the hair, and knocks you down, on that day, you shall be powerless.
You do not remember the Lord, or vibrate upon Him in meditation, and you do not practice compassion; you shall be beaten on your face. ||2||
When the Righteous Judge of Dharma calls for your account, what face will you show Him then?
Says Kabeer, listen, O Saints: in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, you shall be saved. ||3||1||
Raag Maaroo, The Word Of Ravi Daas Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O Love, who else but You could do such a thing?
O Patron of the poor, Lord of the World, You have put the canopy of Your Grace over my head. ||1||Pause||
Only You can grant Mercy to that person whose touch pollutes the world.
You exalt and elevate the lowly, O my Lord of the Universe; You are not afraid of anyone. ||1||
Naam Dayv, Kabeer, Trilochan, Sadhana and Sain crossed over.
Says Ravi Daas, listen, O Saints, through the Dear Lord, all is accomplished. ||2||1||
Maaroo:
The Lord is the ocean of peace; the miraculous tree of life, the jewel of miracles and the wish-fulfilling cow are all under His power.
The four great blessings, the eight great miraculous spiritual powers and the nine treasures are in the palm of His hand. ||1||
Why don't you chant the Lord's Name, Har, Har, Har?
Abandon all other devices of words. ||1||Pause||
The many epics, the Puraanas and the Vedas are all composed out of the letters of the alphabet.
After careful thought, Vyaasa spoke the supreme truth, that there is nothing equal to the Lord's Name. ||2||
In intuitive Samaadhi, their troubles are eliminated; the very fortunate ones lovingly focus on the Lord.
Says Ravi Daas, the Lord's slave remains detached from the world; the fear of birth and death runs away from his mind. ||3||2||15||
