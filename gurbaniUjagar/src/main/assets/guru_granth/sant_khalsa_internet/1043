In this world of love and attachment, no one is anyone else's friend or companion; without the Lord, without the Guru, who has ever found peace? ||4||
He, unto whom the Perfect Guru grants His Grace,
is merged in the Word of the Shabad, through the Teachings of the brave, heroic Guru.
O Nanak, dwell upon, and serve at the Guru's feet; He places those who wander back on the Path. ||5||
The wealth of the Lord's Praise is very dear to the humble Saints.
Through the Guru's Teachings, I have obtained Your Name, Lord.
The beggar serves at the Lord's door, and in the Court of the Lord, sings His Praises. ||6||
When one meets the True Guru, he is called into the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.
In the True Court, he is blessed with salvation and honor.
The faithless cynic has no place of rest in the Lord's palace; he suffers the pains of birth and death. ||7||
So serve the True Guru, the unfathomable ocean,
and you shall obtain the profit, the wealth, the jewel of the Naam.
The filth of corruption is washed away, by bathing in the pool of Ambrosial Nectar. In the Guru's pool, contentment is obtained. ||8||
So serve the Guru without hesitation.
And in the midst of hope, remain unmoved by hope.
Serve the Eradicator of cynicism and suffering, and you shall never again be afflicted by the disease. ||9||
One who is pleasing to the True Lord is blessed with glorious greatness.
Who else can teach him anything?
The Lord and the Guru are pervading in one form. O Nanak, the Lord loves the Guru. ||10||
Some read scriptures, the Vedas and the Puraanas.
Some sit and listen, and read to others.
Tell me, how can the heavy, rigid doors be opened? Without the True Guru, the essence of reality is not realized. ||11||
Some collect dust, and smear their bodies with ashes;
but deep within them are the outcasts of anger and egotism.
Practicing hypocrisy, Yoga is not obtained; without the True Guru, the unseen Lord is not found. ||12||
Some make vows to visit sacred shrines of pilgrimage, keep fasts and live in the forest.
Some practice chastity, charity and self-discipline, and speak of spiritual wisdom.
But without the Lord's Name, how can anyone find peace? Without the True Guru, doubt is not dispelled. ||13||
Inner cleansing techniques, channeling the energy to raise the Kundalini to the Tenth Gate,
inhaling, exhaling and holding the breath by the force of the mind -
by empty hypocritical practices, Dharmic love for the Lord is not produced. Only through the Word of the Guru's Shabad is the sublime, supreme essence obtained. ||14||
Seeing the Lord's creative power, my mind remains satisfied.
Through the Guru's Shabad, I have realized that all is God.
O Nanak, the Lord, the Supreme Soul, is in all. The Guru, the True Guru, has inspired me to see the unseen Lord. ||15||5||22||
Maaroo, Solhay, Third Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
By the Hukam of His Command, He effortlessly created the Universe.
Creating the creation, He gazes upon His own greatness.
He Himself acts, and inspires all to act; in His Will, He pervades and permeates all. ||1||
The world is in the darkness of love and attachment to Maya.
How rare is that Gurmukh who contemplates, and understands.
He alone attains the Lord, unto whom He grants His Grace. He Himself unites in His Union. ||2||
