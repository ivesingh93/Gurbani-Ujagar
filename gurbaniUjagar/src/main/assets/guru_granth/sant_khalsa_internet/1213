Says Nanak, I have found immeasurable peace; my fear of birth and death is gone. ||2||20||43||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
You fool: why are you going somewhere else?
The Enticing Ambrosial Amrit is with you, but you are deluded, totally deluded, and you eat poison. ||1||Pause||
God is Beautiful, Wise and Incomparable; He is the Creator, the Architect of Destiny, but you have no love for Him.
The mad-man's mind is enticed by Maya, the enticer; he has taken the intoxicating drug of falsehood. ||1||
The Destroyer of pain has become kind and compassionate to me, and I am in tune with the Saints.
I have obtained all treasures within the home of my own heart; says Nanak, my light has merged into the Light. ||2||21||44||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
My consciousness has loved my Beloved God, since the very beginning of time.
When You blessed me with the Teachings, O my True Guru, I was embellished with beauty. ||1||Pause||
I am mistaken; You are never mistaken. I am a sinner; You are the Saving Grace of sinners.
I am a lowly thorn-tree, and You are the sandalwood tree. Please preserve my honor by staying with me; please stay with me. ||1||
You are deep and profound, calm and benevolent. What am I? Just a poor helpless being.
The Merciful Guru Nanak has united me with the Lord. I lay on His Bed of Peace. ||2||22||45||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
O my mind, blessed and approved is that day,
and fruitful is that hour, and lucky is that moment, when the True Guru blesses me with spiritual wisdom. ||1||Pause||
Blessed is my good destiny, and blessed is my Husband Lord. Blessed are those upon whom honor is bestowed.
This body is Yours, all my home and wealth are Yours; I offer my heart as a sacrifice to You. ||1||
I obtain tens of thousands and millions of regal pleasures, if I gaze upon Your Blessed Vision, even for an instant.
When You, O God, say, "My servant, stay here with me", Nanak knows unlimited peace. ||2||23||46||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Now I am rid of my skepticism and sorrow.
I have abandoned and forsaken all other efforts, and come to the Sanctuary of the True Guru. ||1||Pause||
I have attained total perfection, and all my works are perfectly completed; the illness of egotism has been totally eradicated.
Millions of sins are destroyed in an instant; meeting with the Guru, I chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||
Subduing the five thieves, he Guru has made them my slaves; my mind has become stable and steady and fearless.
It does not come or go in reincarnation; it does not waver or wander anywhere. O Nanak, my empire is eternal. ||2||24||47||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Here and hereafter, God is forever my Help and Support.
He is the Enticer of my mind, the Beloved of my soul. What Glorious Praises of His can I sing and chant? ||1||Pause||
He plays with me, He fondles and caresses me. Forever and ever, He blesses me with bliss.
He cherishes me, like the father and the mother love their child. ||1||
I cannot survive without Him, even for an instant; I shall never forget Him.
