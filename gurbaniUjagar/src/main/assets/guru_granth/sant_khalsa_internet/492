Goojaree, Third Mehl:
The One Name is the treasure, O Pandit. Listen to these True Teachings.
No matter what you read in duality, reading and contemplating it, you shall only continue to suffer. ||1||
So grasp the Lord's lotus feet; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, you shall come to understand.
With your tongue, taste the sublime elixir of the Lord, and your mind shall be rendered immaculately pure. ||1||Pause||
Meeting the True Guru, the mind becomes content, and then, hunger and desire will not trouble you any longer.
Obtaining the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, one does not go knocking at other doors. ||2||
The self-willed manmukh babbles on and on, but he does not understand.
One whose heart is illumined, by Guru's Teachings, obtains the Name of the Lord. ||3||
You may listen to the Shaastras, but you do not understand, and so you wander from door to door.
He is a fool, who does not understand his own self, and who does not enshrine love for the True Lord. ||4||
The True Lord has fooled the world - no one has any say in this at all.
O Nanak, He does whatever He pleases, according to His Will. ||5||7||9||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Raag Goojaree, Fourth Mehl, Chau-Padas, First House:
O Servant of the Lord, O True Guru, O True Primal Being, I offer my prayers to You, O Guru.
I am an insect and a worm; O True Guru, I seek Your Sanctuary; please, be merciful and bestow upon me the Light of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||
O my Best Friend, O Divine Guru, please illuminate me with the Light of the Lord.
By Guru's Instructions, the Naam is my breath of life, and the Praise of the Lord is my occupation. ||1||Pause||
The Lord's servants have the greatest good fortune; they have faith in the Lord, Har, Har, and a thirst for the Lord.
Obtaining the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, they are satisfied; joining the Company of the Holy, their virtues shine forth. ||2||
Those who have not obtained the essence of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, are most unfortunate; they are taken away by the Messenger of Death.
Those who have not sought the Sanctuary of the True Guru and the Company of the Holy - cursed are their lives, and cursed are their hopes of life. ||3||
Those humble servants of the Lord, who have obtained the Company of the True Guru, have such pre-ordained destiny written on their foreheads.
Blessed, blessed is the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, where the sublime essence of the Lord is obtained. Meeting with His humble servant, O Nanak, the Naam shines forth. ||4||1||
Goojaree, Fourth Mehl:
The Lord, the Lord of the Universe is the Beloved of the minds of those who join the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. The Shabad of His Word fascinates their minds.
Chant, and meditate on the Lord, the Lord of the Universe; God is the One who gives gifts to all. ||1||
O my Siblings of Destiny, the Lord of the Universe, Govind, Govind, Govind, has enticed and fascinated my mind.
I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe, Govind, Govind, Govind; joining the Holy Society of the Guru, Your humble servant is beautified. ||1||Pause||
Devotional worship to the Lord is an ocean of peace; through the Guru's Teachings, wealth, prosperity and the spiritual powers of the Siddhas fall at our feet.
The Lord's Name is the Support of His humble servant; he chants the Lord's Name, and with the Lord's Name he is adorned. ||2||
