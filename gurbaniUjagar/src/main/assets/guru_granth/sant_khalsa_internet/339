Kabeer's Lord is such a Lord and Master, who has no mother or father. ||2||19||70||
Gauree:
Slander me, slander me - go ahead, people, and slander me.
Slander is pleasing to the Lord's humble servant.
Slander is my father, slander is my mother. ||1||Pause||
If I am slandered, I go to heaven;
the wealth of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides within my mind.
If my heart is pure, and I am slandered,
then the slanderer washes my clothes. ||1||
One who slanders me is my friend;
the slanderer is in my thoughts.
The slanderer is the one who prevents me from being slandered.
The slanderer wishes me long life. ||2||
I have love and affection for the slanderer.
Slander is my salvation.
Slander is the best thing for servant Kabeer.
The slanderer is drowned, while I am carried across. ||3||20||71||
O my Sovereign Lord King, You are Fearless; You are the Carrier to carry us across, O my Lord King. ||1||Pause||
When I was, then You were not; now that You are, I am not.
Now, You and I have become one; seeing this, my mind is content. ||1||
When there was wisdom, how could there be strength? Now that there is wisdom, strength cannot prevail.
Says Kabeer, the Lord has taken away my wisdom, and I have attained spiritual perfection. ||2||21||72||
Gauree:
He fashioned the body chamber with six rings, and placed within it the incomparable thing.
He made the breath of life the watchman, with lock and key to protect it; the Creator did this in no time at all. ||1||
Keep your mind awake and aware now, O Sibling of Destiny.
You were careless, and you have wasted your life; your home is being plundered by thieves. ||1||Pause||
The five senses stand as guards at the gate, but now can they be trusted?
When you are conscious in your consciousness, you shall be enlightened and illuminated. ||2||
Seeing the nine openings of the body, the soul-bride is led astray; she does not obtain that incomparable thing.
Says Kabeer, the nine openings of the body are being plundered; rise up to the Tenth Gate, and discover the true essence. ||3||22||73||
Gauree:
O mother, I do not know any other, except Him.
My breath of life resides in Him, whose praises are sung by Shiva and Sanak and so many others. ||Pause||
My heart is illuminated by spiritual wisdom; meeting the Guru, I meditate in the Sky of the Tenth Gate.
The diseases of corruption, fear and bondage have run away; my mind has come to know peace in its own true home. ||1||
Imbued with a balanced single-mindedness, I know and obey God; nothing else enters my mind.
My mind has become fragrant with the scent of sandalwood; I have renounced egotistical selfishness and conceit. ||2||
That humble being, who sings and meditates on the Praises of his Lord and Master, is the dwelling-place of God.
He is blessed with great good fortune; the Lord abides in his mind. Good karma radiates from his forehead. ||3||
I have broken the bonds of Maya; the intuitive peace and poise of Shiva has dawned within me, and I am merged in oneness with the One.
Says Kabeer, meeting the Guru, I have found absolute peace. My mind has ceased its wanderings; I am happy. ||4||23||74||
