He alone is attached, whom the Lord Himself attaches.
The jewel of spiritual wisdom is awakened deep within.
Evil-mindedness is eradicated, and the supreme status is attained.
By Guru's Grace, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||3||
Pressing my palms together, I offer my prayer;
if it pleases You, Lord, please bless me and fulfill me.
Grant Your Mercy, Lord, and bless me with devotion.
Servant Nanak meditates on God forever. ||4||2||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
Blessed is that soul-bride, who realizes God.
She obeys the Hukam of His Order, and abandons her self-conceit.
Imbued with her Beloved, she celebrates in delight. ||1||
Listen, O my companions - these are the signs on the Path to meet God.
Dedicate your mind and body to Him; stop living to please others. ||1||Pause||
One soul-bride counsels another,
to do only that which pleases God.
Such a soul-bride merges into the Being of God. ||2||
One who is in the grip of pride does not obtain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.
She regrets and repents, when her life-night passes away.
The unfortunate self-willed manmukhs suffer in pain. ||3||
I pray to God, but I think that He is far away.
God is imperishable and eternal; He is pervading and permeating everywhere.
Servant Nanak sings of Him; I see Him Ever-present everywhere. ||4||3||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
The Giver has put this household of my being under my own control. I am now the mistress of the Lord's Home.
My Husband Lord has made the ten senses and organs of actions my slaves.
I have gathered together all the faculties and facilities of this house.
I am thirsty with desire and longing for my Husband Lord. ||1||
What Glorious Virtues of my Beloved Husband Lord should I describe?
He is All-knowing, totally beautiful and merciful; He is the Destroyer of ego. ||1||Pause||
I am adorned with Truth, and I have applied the mascara of the Fear of God to my eyes.
I have chewed the betel-leaf of the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord.
My bracelets, robes and ornaments beautifully adorn me.
The soul-bride becomes totally happy, when her Husband Lord comes to her home. ||2||
By the charms of virtue, I have enticed and fascinated my Husband Lord.
He is under my power - the Guru has dispelled my doubts.
My mansion is lofty and elevated.
Renouncing all other brides, my Beloved has become my lover. ||3||
The sun has risen, and its light shines brightly.
I have prepared my bed with infinite care and faith.
My Darling Beloved is new and fresh; He has come to my bed to enjoy me.
O Servant Nanak, my Husband Lord has come; the soul-bride has found peace. ||4||4||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
An intense yearning to meet God has welled up in my heart.
I have gone out searching to find my Beloved Husband Lord.
Hearing news of my Beloved, I have laid out my bed in my home.
Wandering, wandering all around, I came, but I did not even see Him. ||1||
How can this poor heart be comforted?
Come and meet me, O Friend; I am a sacrifice to You. ||1||Pause||
One bed is spread out for the bride and her Husband Lord.
The bride is asleep, while her Husband Lord is always awake.
The bride is intoxicated, as if she has drunk wine.
The soul-bride only awakens when her Husband Lord calls to her. ||2||
She has lost hope - so many days have passed.
I have travelled through all the lands and the countries.
