No one believes what the slanderer says.
The slanderer tells lies, and later regrets and repents.
He wrings his hands, and hits his head against the ground.
The Lord does not forgive the slanderer. ||2||
The Lord's slave does not wish anyone ill.
The slanderer suffers, as if stabbed by a spear.
Like a crane, he spreads his feathers, to look like a swan.
When he speaks with his mouth, then he is exposed and driven out. ||3||
The Creator is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.
That person, whom the Lord makes His Own, becomes stable and steady.
The Lord's slave is true in the Court of the Lord.
Servant Nanak speaks, after contemplating the essence of reality. ||4||41||54||
