O Nanak, that is the most wonderful gift, which is received from the Lord, when He is totally pleased. ||1||
Second Mehl:
What sort of service is this, by which the fear of the Lord Master does not depart?
O Nanak, he alone is called a servant, who merges with the Lord Master. ||2||
Pauree:
O Nanak, the Lord's limits cannot be known; He has no end or limitation.
He Himself creates, and then He Himself destroys.
Some have chains around their necks, while some ride on many horses.
He Himself acts, and He Himself causes us to act. Unto whom should I complain?
O Nanak, the One who created the creation - He Himself takes care of it. ||23||
Shalok, First Mehl:
He Himself fashioned the vessel of the body, and He Himself fills it.
Into some, milk is poured, while others remain on the fire.
Some lIE down and sleep on soft beds, while others remain watchful.
He adorns those, O Nanak, upon whom He casts His Glance of Grace. ||1||
Second Mehl:
He Himself creates and fashions the world, and He Himself keeps it in order.
Having created the beings within it, He oversees their birth and death.
Unto whom should we speak, O Nanak, when He Himself is all-in-all? ||2||
Pauree:
The description of the greatness of the Great Lord cannot be described.
He is the Creator, all-powerful and benevolent; He gives sustenance to all beings.
The mortal does that work, which has been pre-destined from the very beginning.
O Nanak, except for the One Lord, there is no other place at all.
He does whatever He wills. ||24||1|| Sudh||
One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:
Raag Aasaa, The Word Of The Devotees:
Kabeer, Naam Dayv And Ravi Daas.
Aasaa, Kabeer Jee:
Falling at the Feet of the Guru, I pray, and ask Him, "Why was man created?
What deeds cause the world to come into being, and be destroyed? Tell me, that I may understand".||1||
O Divine Guru, please, show Mercy to me, and place me on the right path, by which the bonds of fear may be cut away.
The pains of birth and death come from past actions and karma; peace comes when the soul finds release from reincarnation. ||1||Pause||
The mortal does not break free from the bonds of the noose of Maya, and he does not seek the shelter of the profound, absolute Lord.
He does not realize the dignity of the self, and Nirvaanaa; because of this, his doubt does not depart. ||2||
The soul is not born, even though he thinks it is born; it is free from birth and death.
When the mortal gives up his ideas of birth and death, he remains constantly absorbed in the Lord's Love. ||3||
As the reflection of an object blends in the water when the pitcher is broken,
says Kabeer, just so virtue dispels doubt, and then the soul is absorbed in the profound, absolute Lord. ||4||1||
