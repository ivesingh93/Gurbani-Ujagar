Raag Maalee Gauraa, Fourth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:
Countless have tried, but none have found the Lord's limit.
The Lord is inaccessible, unapproachable and unfathomable; I humbly bow to the Lord God, my King. ||1||Pause||
Sexual desire, anger, greed and emotional attachment bring continual conflict and strife.
Save me, save me, I am your humble creature, O Lord; I have come to Your Sanctuary, O my Lord God. ||1||
You protect and preserve those who take to Your Sanctuary, God; You are called the Lover of Your devotees.
Prahlaad, Your humble servant, was caught by Harnaakhash; but You saved Him and carried him across, Lord. ||2||
Remember the Lord, O mind, and rise up to the Mansion of His Presence; the Sovereign Lord is the Destroyer of pain.
Our Lord and Master takes away the fear of birth and death; following the Guru's Teachings, the Lord God is found. ||3||
The Name of the Lord, our Lord and Master, is the Purifier of sinners; I sing of the Lord, the Destroyer of the fears of His devotees.
One who wears the necklace of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, in his heart, O servant Nanak, merges in the Naam. ||4||1||
Maalee Gauraa, Fourth Mehl:
O my mind, chant the Name of the Lord, the Giver of peace.
One who joins the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, and enjoys the sublime taste of the Lord, as Gurmukh, comes to realize God. ||1||Pause||
By great good fortune, one obtains the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan; meeting with the Guru, the Lord God is known.
The filth of evil-mindedness is totally washed away, bathing in the Lord's ambrosial pool of nectar. ||1||
Blessed, blessed are the Holy, who have found their Lord God; I ask them to tell me the stories of the Lord.
I fall at their feet, and always pray to them, to mercifully unite me with my Lord, the Architect of Destiny. ||2||
Through the destiny written on my forehead, I have found the Holy Guru; my mind and body are imbued with the Guru's Word.
The Lord God has come to meet me; I have found peace, and I am rid of all the sins. ||3||
Those who follow the Guru's Teachings find the Lord, the source of nectar; their words are sublime and exalted.
By great good fortune, one is blessed with the dust of their feet; servant Nanak falls at their feet. ||4||2||
