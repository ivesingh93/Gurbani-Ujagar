Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Meeting with the True Guru, you shall not have to go through the cycle of reincarnation again; the pains of birth and death will be taken away.
Through the Perfect Word of the Shabad, all understanding is obtained; remain absorbed in the Name of the Lord. ||1||
O my mind, focus your consciousness on the True Guru.
The Immaculate Naam itself, ever-fresh, comes to abide within the mind. ||1||Pause||
O Dear Lord, please protect and preserve me in Your Sanctuary. As You keep me, so do I remain.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Gurmukh remains dead while yet alive, and swims across the terrifying world-ocean. ||2||
By great good fortune, the Name is obtained. Following the Guru's Teachings, through the Shabad, you shall be exalted.
God, the Creator Himself, dwells within the mind; remain absorbed in the state of intuitive balance. ||3||
Some are self-willed manmukhs; they do not love the Word of the Shabad. Bound in chains, they wander lost in reincarnation.
Through 8.4 million lifetimes, they wander over and over again; they waste away their lives in vain. ||4||
In the minds of the devotees there is bliss; they are attuned to the Love of the True Word of the Shabad.
Night and day, they constantly sing the Glories of the Immaculate Lord; with intuitive ease, they are absorbed into the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||5||
The Gurmukhs speak the Ambrosial Bani; they recognize the Lord, the Supreme Soul in all.
They serve the One; they worship and adore the One. The Gurmukhs speak the Unspoken Speech. ||6||
The Gurmukhs serve their True Lord and Master, who comes to dwell in the mind.
They are forever attuned to the Love of the True One, who bestows His Mercy and unites them with Himself. ||7||
He Himself does, and He Himself causes others to do; He wakes some from their sleep.
He Himself unites us in Union; Nanak is absorbed in the Shabad. ||8||7||24||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Serving the True Guru, the mind becomes immaculate, and the body becomes pure.
The mind obtains bliss and eternal peace, meeting with the Deep and Profound Lord.
Sitting in the Sangat, the True Congregation, the mind is comforted and consoled by the True Name. ||1||
O mind, serve the True Guru without hesitation.
Serving the True Guru, the Lord abides within the mind, and no trace of filth shall attach itself to you. ||1||Pause||
From the True Word of the Shabad comes honor. True is the Name of the True One.
I am a sacrifice to those who conquer their ego and recognize the Lord.
The self-willed manmukhs do not know the True One; they find no shelter, and no place of rest anywhere. ||2||
Those who take the Truth as their food and the Truth as their clothing, have their home in the True One.
They constantly praise the True One, and in the True Word of the Shabad they have their dwelling.
They recognize the Lord, the Supreme Soul in all, and through the Guru's Teachings they dwell in the home of their own inner self. ||3||
They see the Truth, and they speak the Truth; their bodies and minds are True.
True are their teachings, and True are their instructions; True are the reputations of the true ones.
Those who have forgotten the True One are miserable-they depart weeping and wailing. ||4||
Those who have not served the True Guru-why did they even bother to come into the world?
They are bound and gagged and beaten at Death's door, but no one hears their shrieks and cries.
They waste their lives uselessly; they die and are reincarnated over and over again. ||5||
