O Lord, You are the Greatest of the Great, the Greatest of the Great, the most Lofty and High. You do whatever You please.
Servant Nanak drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar through the Guru's Teachings. Blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed, blessed and praised is the Guru. ||2||2||8||
Kaanraa, Fourth Mehl:
O mind, meditate and vibrate on the Lord, Raam, Raam.
He has no form or feature - He is Great!
Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, vibrate and meditate on the Lord.
This is the high destiny written on your forehead. ||1||Pause||
That household, that mansion, in which the Lord's Praises are sung - that home is filled with ecstasy and joy; so vibrate and meditate on the Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam.
Sing the Glorious Praises of the Name of the Lord, the Beloved Lord. Through the Teachings of the Guru, the Guru, the True Guru, you shall find peace. So vibrate and meditate on the Lord, Har, Haray, Har, Haray, Haray, the Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam. ||1||
You are the Support of the whole universe, Lord; O Merciful Lord, You, You, You are the Creator of all, Raam, Raam, Raam.
Servant Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary; please bless him with the Guru's Teachings, that he may vibrate and meditate on the Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam. ||2||3||9||
Kaanraa, Fourth Mehl:
I eagerly kiss the Feet of the True Guru.
Meeting Him, the Path to the Lord becomes smooth and easy.
I lovingly vibrate and meditate on the Lord, and gulp down His Sublime Essence.
The Lord has written this destiny on my forehead. ||1||Pause||
Some perform the six rituals and rites; the Siddhas, seekers and Yogis put on all sorts of pompous shows, with their hair all tangled and matted.
Yoga - Union with the Lord God - is not obtained by wearing religious robes; the Lord is found in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, and the Guru's Teachings. The humble Saints throw the doors wide open. ||1||
O my Lord and Master, You are the farthest of the far, utterly unfathomable. You are totally pervading the water and the land. You alone are the One and Only Unique Lord of all creation.
You alone know all Your ways and means. You alone understand Yourself. Servant Nanak's Lord God is in each heart, in every heart, in the home of each and every heart. ||2||4||10||
Kaanraa, Fourth Mehl:
O mind, chant and meditate on the Lord, the Lord of the Universe.
The Lord, Har, Har, is inaccessible and unfathomable.
Through the Guru's Teachings, my intellect attains the Lord God.
This is the pre-ordained destiny written on my forehead. ||1||Pause||
Collecting the poison of Maya, people think of all sorts of evil. But peace is found only by vibrating and meditating on the Lord; with the Saints, in the Sangat, the Society of the Saints, meet the True Guru, the Holy Guru.
Just as when the iron slag is transmuted into gold by touching the Philosopher's Stone - when the sinner joins the Sangat, he becomes pure, through the Guru's Teachings. ||1||
Just like the heavy iron which is carried across on the wooden raft, sinners are carried across in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and the Guru, the True Guru, the Holy Guru.
There are four castes, four social classes, and four stages of life. Whoever meets the Guru, Guru Nanak, is himself carried across, and he carries all his ancestors and generations across as well. ||2||5||11||
Kaanraa, Fourth Mehl:
Sing the Praises of the Lord God.
Singing His Praises, sins are washed away.
Through the Word of the Guru's Teachings, listen to His Praises with your ears.
The Lord shall be Merciful to you. ||1||Pause||
