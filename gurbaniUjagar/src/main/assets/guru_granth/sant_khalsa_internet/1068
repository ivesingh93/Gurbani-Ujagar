He alone puts out this fire, who practices and lives the Guru's Shabad.
His body and mind are cooled and soothed, and his anger is silenced; conquering egotism, he merges in the Lord. ||15||
True is the Lord and Master, and True is His glorious greatness.
By Guru's Grace, a rare few attain this.
Nanak offers this one prayer: through the Naam, the Name of the Lord, may I merge in the Lord. ||16||1||23||
Maaroo, Third Mehl:
By Your Grace, please unite with Your devotees.
Your devotees ever praise You, lovingly focusing on You.
In Your Sanctuary, they are saved, O Creator Lord; You unite them in Union with Yourself. ||1||
Sublime and exalted is devotion to the Perfect Word of the Shabad.
Peace prevails within; they are pleasing to Your Mind.
One whose mind and body are imbued with true devotion, focuses his consciousness on the True Lord. ||2||
In egotism, the body is forever burning.
When God grants His Grace, one meets the Perfect Guru.
The Shabad dispels the spiritual ignorance within, and through the True Guru, one finds peace. ||3||
The blind, self-willed manmukh acts blindly.
He is in terrible trouble, and wanders in reincarnation.
He can never snap the noose of Death, and in the end, he suffers in horrible pain. ||4||
Through the Shabad, one's comings and goings in reincarnation are ended.
He keeps the True Name enshrined within his heart.
He dies in the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and conquers his mind; stilling his egotism, he merges in the Lord. ||5||
Coming and going, the people of the world are wasting away.
Without the True Guru, no one finds permanence and stability.
The Shabad shines its Light deep within the self, and one dwells in peace; one's light merges into the Light. ||6||
The five demons think of evil and corruption.
The expanse is the manifestation of emotional attachment to Maya.
Serving the True Guru, one is liberated, and the five demons are put under his control. ||7||
Without the Guru, there is only the darkness of attachment.
Over and over, time and time again, they are drowned.
Meeting the True Guru, Truth is implanted within, and the True Name becomes pleasing to the mind. ||8||
True is His Door, and True is His Court, His Royal Darbaar.
The true ones serve Him, through the Beloved Word of the Shabad.
Singing the Glorious Praises of the True Lord, in the true melody, I am immersed and absorbed in Truth. ||9||
Deep within the home of the self, one finds the home of the Lord.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, one easily, intuitively finds it.
There, one is not afflicted with sorrow or separation; merge into the Celestial Lord with intuitive ease. ||10||
The evil people live in the love of duality.
They wander around, totally attached and thirsty.
They sit in evil gatherings, and suffer in pain forever; they earn pain, nothing but pain. ||11||
Without the True Guru, there is no Sangat, no Congregation.
Without the Shabad, no one can cross over to the other side.
One who intuitively chants God's Glorious Praises day and night - his light merges into the Light. ||12||
The body is the tree; the bird of the soul dwells within it.
It drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar, resting in the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
It never flies away, and it does not come or go; it dwells within the home of its own self. ||13||
Purify the body, and contemplate the Shabad.
Remove the poisonous drug of emotional attachment, and eradicate doubt.
The Giver of peace Himself bestows His Mercy, and unites us in Union with Himself. ||14||
