The Mul Mantra, the Root Mantra, is the only cure for the mind; I have installed faith in God in my mind.
Nanak ever longs for the dust of the Lord's feet; again and again, he is a sacrifice to the Lord. ||2||16||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
I have fallen in love with the Lord.
My True Guru is always my help and support; He has torn down the banner of pain. ||1||Pause||
Giving me His hand, He has protected me as His own, and removed all my troubles.
He has blackened the faces of the slanderers, and He Himself has become the help and support of His humble servant. ||1||
The True Lord and Master has become my Saviour; hugging me close in His embrace, He has saved me.
Nanak has become fearless, and he enjoys eternal peace, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||2||17||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
Your Name is the medicine, O Merciful Lord.
I am so miserable, I do not know Your state; You Yourself cherish me, Lord. ||1||Pause||
Take pity on me, O my Lord and Master, and remove the love of duality from within me.
Break my bonds, and take me as Your own, so that I may never come to lose. ||1||
Seeking Your Sanctuary, I live, almighty and merciful Lord and Master.
Twenty-four hours a day, I worship God; Nanak is forever a sacrifice to Him. ||2||18||
Raag Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O God, please save me!
By myself, I cannot do anything, O my Lord and Master; by Your Grace, please bless me with Your Name. ||1||Pause||
Family and worldly affairs are an ocean of fire.
Through doubt, emotional attachment and ignorance, we are enveloped in darkness. ||1||
High and low, pleasure and pain.
Hunger and thirst are not satisfied. ||2||
The mind is engrossed in passion, and the disease of corruption.
The five thieves, the companions, are totally incorrigible. ||3||
The beings and souls and wealth of the world are all Yours.
O Nanak, know that the Lord is always near at hand. ||4||1||19||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
The Lord and Master destroys the pain of the poor; He preserves and protects the honor of His servants.
The Lord is the ship to carry us across; He is the treasure of virtue - pain cannot touch Him. ||1||
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, meditate, vibrate upon the Lord of the world.
I cannot think of any other way; make this effort, and make it in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga. ||Pause||
In the beginning, and in the end, there is none other than the perfect, merciful Lord.
The cycle of birth and death is ended, chanting the Lord's Name, and remembering the Lord Master in meditation. ||2||
The Vedas, the Simritees, the Shaastras and the Lord's devotees contemplate Him;
liberation is attained in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and the darkness of ignorance is dispelled. ||3||
The lotus feet of the Lord are the support of His humble servants. They are his only capital and investment.
