Please shower Your Mercy upon me, and permit me to ignore the great enticements of Maya, O Lord, Merciful to the meek.
Give me Your Name - chanting it, I live; please bring the efforts of Your slave to fruition. ||1||
All desires, power, pleasure, joy and lasting bliss, are found by chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and singing the Kirtan of His Praises.
That humble servant of the Lord, who has such karma pre-ordained by the Creator Lord, O Nanak - his efforts are brought to perfect fruition. ||2||20||51||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
The Supreme Lord God takes care of His humble servant.
The slanderers are not allowed to stay; they are pulled out by their roots, like useless weeds. ||1||Pause||
Wherever I look, there I see my Lord and Master; no one can harm me.
Whoever shows disrespect to the Lord's humble servant, is instantly reduced to ashes. ||1||
The Creator Lord has become my protector; He has no end or limitation.
O Nanak, God has protected and saved His slaves; He has driven out and destroyed the slanderers. ||2||21||52||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl, Ninth House, Partaal:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O Lord, I seek the Sanctuary of Your feet; Lord of the Universe, Destroyer of pain, please bless Your slave with Your Name.
Be Merciful, God, and bless me with Your Glance of Grace; take my arm and save me - pull me up out of this pit! ||Pause||
He is blinded by sexual desire and anger, bound by Maya; his body and clothes are filled with countless sins.
Without God, there is no other protector; help me to chant Your Name, Almighty Warrior, Sheltering Lord. ||1||
Redeemer of sinners, Saving Grace of all beings and creatures, even those who recite the Vedas have not found Your limit.
God is the ocean of virtue and peace, the source of jewels; Nanak sings the Praises of the Lover of His devotees. ||2||1||53||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
Peace in this world, peace in the next world and peace forever, remembering Him in meditation. Chant forever the Name of the Lord of the Universe.
The sins of past lives are erased, by joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; new life is infused into the dead. ||1||Pause||
In power, youth and Maya, the Lord is forgotten; this is the greatest tragedy - so say the spiritual sages.
Hope and desire to sing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises - this is the treasure of the most fortunate devotees. ||1||
O Lord of Sanctuary, all-powerful, imperceptible and unfathomable - Your Name is the Purifier of sinners.
The Inner-knower, the Lord and Master of Nanak is totally pervading and permeating everywhere; He is my Lord and Master. ||2||2||54||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl, Twelfth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
I bow in reverence to the Lord, I bow in reverence. I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, my King. ||Pause||
By great good fortune, one meets the Divine Guru.
Millions of sins are erased by serving the Lord. ||1||
