Bestowing the gift of the soul, He satisfies the mortal beings, and merges them in the True Name.
Night and day, they ravish and enjoy the Lord within the heart; they are intuitively absorbed in Samaadhi. ||2||
The Shabad, the Word of the True Guru, has pierced my mind. The True Word of His Bani permeates my heart.
My God is Unseen; He cannot be seen. The Gurmukh speaks the Unspoken.
When the Giver of peace grants His Grace, the mortal being meditates on the Lord, the Life of the Universe. ||3||
He does not come and go in reincarnation any longer; the Gurmukh meditates intuitively.
From the mind, the mind merges into our Lord and Master; the mind is absorbed into the Mind.
In truth, the True Lord is pleased with truth; eradicate egotism from within yourself. ||4||
Our One and Only Lord and Master dwells within the mind; there is no other at all.
The One Name is Sweet Ambrosial Nectar; it is Immaculate Truth in the world.
O Nanak, the Name of God is obtained, by those who are so predestined. ||5||4||
Malaar, Third Mehl:
All the heavenly heralds and celestial singers are saved through the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
They contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad. Subduing their ego, the Name abides in their minds; they keep the Lord enshrined in their hearts.
He alone understands, whom the Lord causes to understand; the Lord unites him with Himself.
Night and day, he sings the Word of the Shabad and the Guru's Bani; he remains lovingly attuned to the True Lord. ||1||
O my mind, each and every moment, dwell on the Naam.
The Shabad is the Guru's Gift. It shall bring you lasting peace deep within; it shall always stand by you. ||1||Pause||
The self-willed manmukhs never give up their hypocrisy; in the love of duality, they suffer in pain.
Forgetting the Naam, their minds are imbued with corruption. They waste away their lives uselessly.
This opportunity shall not come into their hands again; night and day, they shall always regret and repent.
They die and die again and again, only to be reborn, but they never understand. They rot away in manure. ||2||
The Gurmukhs are imbued with the Naam, and are saved; they contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Meditating on the Name of the Lord, they are Jivan-mukta, liberated while yet alive. They enshrine the Lord within their hearts.
Their minds and bodies are immaculate, their intellect is immaculate and sublime. Their speech is sublime as well.
They realize the One Primal Being, the One Lord God. There is no other at all. ||3||
God Himself is the Doer, and He Himself is the Cause of causes. He Himself bestows His Glance of Grace.
My mind and body are imbued with the Word of the Guru's Bani. My consciousness is immersed in His service.
The Unseen and Inscrutable Lord dwells deep within. He is seen only by the Gurmukh.
O Nanak, He gives to whomever He pleases. According to the Pleasure of His Will, He leads the mortals on. ||4||5||
Malaar, Third Mehl, Du-Tukas:
Through the True Guru, the mortal obtains the special place, the Mansion of the Lord's Presence in his own home.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, his egotistical pride is dispelled. ||1||
Those who have the Naam inscribed on their foreheads,
meditate on the Naam night and day, forever and ever. They are honored in the True Court of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
From the True Guru, they learn the ways and means of the mind. Night and day, they focus their meditation on the Lord forever.
