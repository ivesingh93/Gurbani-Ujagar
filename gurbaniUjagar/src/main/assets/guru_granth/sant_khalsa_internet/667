The Lord, Har, Har, is unapproachable, of unfathomable wisdom, unlimited, all-powerful and infinite.
Show Mercy to Your humble servant, O Life of the world, and save the honor of servant Nanak. ||4||1||
Dhanaasaree, Fourth Mehl:
The humble Saints of the Lord meditate on the Lord; their pain, doubt and fear have run away.
The Lord Himself inspires them to serve Him; they are awakened within to the Guru's Teachings. ||1||
Imbued with the Lord's Name, they are unattached to the world.
Listening to the sermon of the Lord, Har, Har, their minds are pleased; through Guru's Instruction, they enshrine love for the Lord. ||1||Pause||
God, the Lord and Master, is the caste and social status of His humble Saints. You are the Lord and Master; I am just Your puppet.
As is the understanding You bless us with, so are the words we speak. ||2||
What are we? Tiny worms, and microscopic germs. You are our great and glorious Lord and Master.
I cannot describe Your state and extent. O God, how can we unfortunate ones meet with You? ||3||
O God, my Lord and Master, shower me with Your Mercy, and commit me to Your service.
Make Nanak the slave of Your slaves, God; I speak the speech of the Lord's sermon. ||4||2||
Dhanaasaree, Fourth Mehl:
The True Guru is the Lord's Saint, the True Being, who chants the Bani of the Lord, Har, Har.
Whoever chants it, and listens to it, is liberated; I am forever a sacrifice to him. ||1||
O Saints of the Lord, listen to the Lord's Praises with your ears.
Listen to the sermon of the Lord, Har, Har, for a moment, for even an instant, and all your sins and mistakes shall be erased. ||1||Pause||
Those who find such humble, Holy Saints, are the greatest of the great persons.
I beg for the dust of their feet; I long for the longing for God, my Lord and Master. ||2||
The Name of God, the Lord and Master, Har, Har, is the fruit-bearing tree; those who meditate on it are satisfied.
Drinking in the ambrosia of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, I am satisfied; all my hunger and thirst is quenched. ||3||
Those who are blessed with the highest, loftiest destiny, chant and meditate on the Lord.
Let me join their congregation, O God, my Lord and Master; Nanak is the slave of their slaves. ||4||3||
Dhanaasaree, Fourth Mehl:
I am blind, totally blind, entangled in corruption and poison. How can I walk on the Guru's Path?
If the True Guru, the Giver of peace, shows His kindness, He attaches us to the hem of His robe. ||1||
O Sikhs of the Guru, O friends, walk on the Guru's Path.
Whatever the Guru says, accept that as good; the sermon of the Lord, Har, Har, is unique and wonderful. ||1||Pause||
O Saints of the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny, listen: serve the Guru, quickly now!
Let your service to the True Guru be your supplies on the Lord's Path; pack them up, and don't think of today or tomorrow. ||2||
O Saints of the Lord, chant the chant of the Lord's Name; the Lord's Saints walk with the Lord.
Those who meditate on the Lord, become the Lord; the playful, wondrous Lord meets them. ||3||
To chant the chant of the Lord's Name, Har, Har, is the longing I long for; have Mercy upon me, O Lord of the world-forest.
O Lord, unite servant Nanak with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; make me the dust of the feet of the Holy. ||4||4||
