With my feet, I walk on the Path of my Lord and Master. ||1||
It is a good time, when I remember Him in meditation.
Meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, I cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||Pause||
With your eyes, behold the Blessed Vision of the Saints.
Record the Immortal Lord God within your mind. ||2||
Listen to the Kirtan of His Praises, at the Feet of the Holy.
Your fears of birth and death shall depart. ||3||
Enshrine the Lotus Feet of your Lord and Master within your heart.
Thus this human life, so difficult to obtain, shall be redeemed. ||4||51||120||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Those, upon whom the Lord Himself showers His Mercy,
chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, with their tongues. ||1||
Forgetting the Lord, superstition and sorrow shall overtake you.
Meditating on the Naam, doubt and fear shall depart. ||1||Pause||
Listening to the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises, and singing the Lord's Kirtan,
misfortune shall not even come near you. ||2||
Working for the Lord, His humble servants look beautiful.
The fire of Maya does not touch them. ||3||
Within their minds, bodies and mouths, is the Name of the Merciful Lord.
Nanak has renounced other entanglements. ||4||52||121||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Renounce your cleverness, and your cunning tricks.
Seek the Support of the Perfect Guru. ||1||
Your pain shall depart, and in peace, you shall sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
Meeting the Perfect Guru, let yourself be absorbed in the Lord's Love. ||1||Pause||
The Guru has given me the Mantra of the Name of the Lord.
My worries are forgotten, and my anxiety is gone. ||2||
Meeting with the Merciful Guru, I am in ecstasy.
Showering His Mercy, He has cut away the noose of the Messenger of Death. ||3||
Says Nanak, I have found the Perfect Guru;
Maya shall no longer harass me. ||4||53||122||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
The Perfect Guru Himself has saved me.
The self-willed manmukhs are afflicted with misfortune. ||1||
Chant and meditate on the Guru, the Guru, O my friend.
Your face shall be radiant in the Court of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Enshrine the Feet of the Guru within your heart;
your pains, enemies and bad luck shall be destroyed. ||2||
The Word of the Guru's Shabad is your Companion and Helper.
O Siblings of Destiny, all beings shall be kind to you. ||3||
When the Perfect Guru granted His Grace,
says Nanak, I was totally, completely fulfilled. ||4||54||123||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Like beasts, they consume all sorts of tasty treats.
With the rope of emotional attachment, they are bound and gagged like thieves. ||1||
Their bodies are corpses, without the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
They come and go in reincarnation, and are destroyed by pain. ||1||Pause||
They wear all sorts of beautiful robes,
but they are still just scarecrows in the field, frightening away the birds. ||2||
All bodies are of some use,
but those who do not meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are totally useless. ||3||
Says Nanak, those unto whom the Lord becomes Merciful,
join the Saadh Sangat, and meditate on the Lord of the Universe. ||4||55||124||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
