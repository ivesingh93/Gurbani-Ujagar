Raag Aasaa, Eighth House, Kaafee, Fourth Mehl:
Death is ordained from the very beginning, and yet ego makes us cry.
Meditating on the Naam, as Gurmukh, one becomes stable and steady. ||1||
Blessed is the Perfect Guru, through whom the way of Death is known.
The sublime people earn the profit of the Naam, the Name of the Lord; they are absorbed in the Word of the Shabad. ||1||Pause||
The days of one's life are pre-ordained; they will come to their end, O mother.
One must depart, today or tomorrow, according to the Lord's Primal Order. ||2||
Useless are the lives of those, who have forgotten the Naam.
They play the game of chance in this world, and lose their mind. ||3||
Those who have found the Guru are at peace, in life and in death.
O Nanak, the true ones are truly absorbed into the True Lord. ||4||12||64||
Aasaa, Fourth Mehl:
Having obtained the treasure of this human birth, I meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
By Guru's Grace, I understand, and I am absorbed into the True Lord. ||1||
Those who have such pre-ordained destiny practice the Naam.
The True Lord summons the truthful to the Mansion of His Presence. ||1||Pause||
Deep within is the treasure of the Naam; it is obtained by the Gurmukh.
Night and day, meditate on the Naam, and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||2||
Deep within are infinite substances, but the self-willed manmukh does not find them.
In egotism and pride, the mortal's proud self consumes him. ||3||
O Nanak, his identity consumes his identical identity.
Through the Guru's Teachings, the mind is illumined, and meets the True Lord. ||4||13||65||
Raag Aasaavaree, 2 Of Sixteenth House, Fourth Mehl, Sudhang:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Night and day, I sing the Kirtan, the Praises of the Name of the Lord.
The True Guru has revealed to me the Name of the Lord; without the Lord, I cannot live, for a moment, even an instant. ||1||Pause||
My ears hear the Lord's Kirtan, and I contemplate Him; without the Lord, I cannot live, even for an instant.
As the swan cannot live without the lake, how can the Lord's slave live without serving Him? ||1||
Some enshrine love for duality in their hearts, and some pledge love for worldly attachments and ego.
The Lord's servant embraces love for the Lord and the state of Nirvaanaa; Nanak contemplates the Lord, the Lord God. ||2||14||66||
Aasaavaree, Fourth Mehl:
O mother, my mother, tell me about my Beloved Lord.
Without the Lord, I cannot live for a moment, even an instant; I love Him, like the camel loves the vine. ||1||Pause||
My mind has become sad and distant, longing for the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, my Friend.
As the bumblebee cannot live without the lotus, I cannot live without the Lord. ||1||
Keep me under Your Protection, O Beloved Master of the Universe; fulfill my faith, O Lord of the World.
