Kalyaan, Fifth Mehl:
O, the Wondrous Glory of my Beloved!
My mind is rejuvenated forever by His Wondrous Love. ||1||Pause||
Brahma, Shiva, the Siddhas, the silent sages and Indra beg for the charity of His Praise and devotion to Him. ||1||
Yogis, spiritual teachers, meditators and the thousand-headed serpent all meditate on the Waves of God.
Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to the Saints, who are the Eternal Companions of God. ||2||3||
Kalyaan, Fifth Mehl, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Belief in You, Lord, brings honor.
To see with my eyes, and hear with my ears - every limb and fiber of my being, and my breath of life are in bliss. ||1||Pause||
Here and there, and in the ten directions You are pervading, in the mountain and the blade of grass. ||1||
Wherever I look, I see the Lord, the Supreme Lord, the Primal Being.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, doubt and fear are dispelled. Nanak speaks the Wisdom of God. ||2||1||4||
Kalyaan, Fifth Mehl:
The Glory of God is the Sound-current of the Naad, the Celestial Music of Bliss, and the Wisdom of the Vedas.
Speaking and listening, the silent sages and humble beings join together, in the Realm of the Saints. ||1||Pause||
Spiritual wisdom, meditation, faith and charity are there; their minds savor the Taste of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Chanting it, sins are destroyed. ||1||
This is the technology of Yoga, spiritual wisdom, devotion, intuitive knowledge of the Shabad, certain knowledge of the Essence of Reality, chanting and unbroken intensive meditation.
Through and through, O Nanak, merging into the Light, you shall never again suffer pain and punishment. ||2||2||5||
Kalyaan, Fifth Mehl:
What should I do, and how should I do it?
Should I center myself in meditation, or study the spiritual wisdom of the Shaastras? How can I endure this unendurable state? ||1||Pause||
Vishnu, Shiva, the Siddhas, the silent sages and Indra - at whose door should I seek sanctuary? ||1||
Some have power and influence, and some are blessed with heavenly paradise, but out of millions, will anyone find liberation?
Says Nanak, I have attained the Sublime Essence of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. I touch the feet of the Holy. ||2||3||6||
Kalyaan, Fifth Mehl:
The Lord of the Breath of Life, the Merciful Primal Lord God, is my Friend.
The Lord saves us from the womb of reincarnation and the noose of death in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga; He takes away our pain. ||1||Pause||
I enshrine the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within; I seek Your Sanctuary, Lord.
O Merciful Lord God, You are my only Support. ||1||
You are the only Hope of the helpless, the meek and the poor.
Your Name, O my Lord and Master, is the Mantra of the mind. ||2||
I know of nothing except You, God.
Throughout all the ages, I realize You. ||3||
O Lord, You dwell in my mind night and day.
The Lord of the Universe is Nanak's only Support. ||4||4||7||
Kalyaan, Fifth Mehl:
Within my mind and body I meditate on the Lord God.
The Perfect Guru is pleased and satisfied; I am blessed with eternal peace and happiness. ||1||Pause||
All affairs are successfully resolved, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the World.
Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I dwell upon God, and the pain of death is taken away. ||1||
Please take pity on me, O my God, that I may serve You day and night.
