Without the True Word of the Shabad, you shall never be released, and your life shall be totally useless. ||1||Pause||
Within the body are sexual desire, anger, egotism and attachment. This pain is so great, and so difficult to endure.
As Gurmukh, chant the Lord's Name, and savor it with your tongue; in this way, you shall cross over to the other side. ||2||
Your ears are deaf, and your intellect is worthless, and still, you do not intuitively understand the Word of the Shabad.
The self-willed manmukh wastes this priceless human life and loses it. Without the Guru, the blind person cannot see. ||3||
Whoever remains detached and free of desire in the midst of desire - and whoever, unattached, intuitively meditates on the Celestial Lord-
prays Nanak, as Gurmukh, he is released. He is lovingly attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||||2||3||
Bhairao, First Mehl:
His walk becomes weak and clumsy, his feet and hands shake, and the skin of his body is withered and wrinkled.
His eyes are dim, his ears are deaf, and yet, the self-willed manmukh does not know the Naam. ||1||
O blind man, what have you obtained by coming into the world?
The Lord is not in your heart, and you do not serve the Guru. After wasting your capital, you shall have to depart. ||1||Pause||
Your tongue is not imbued with the Love of the Lord; whatever you say is tasteless and insipid.
You indulge in slander of the Saints; becoming a beast, you shall never be noble. ||2||
Only a few obtain the sublime essence of the Ambrosial Amrit, united in Union with the True Guru.
As long as the mortal does not come to understand the mystery of the Shabad, the Word of God, he shall continue to be tormented by death. ||3||
Whoever finds the door of the One True Lord, does not know any other house or door.
By Guru's Grace, I have obtained the supreme status; so says poor Nanak. ||4||3||4||
Bhairao, First Mehl:
He spends the entire night in sleep; the noose is tied around his neck. His day is wasted in worldly entanglements.
He does not know God, who created this world, for a moment, for even an instant. ||1||
O mortal, how will you escape this terrible disaster?
What did you bring with you, and what will you take away? Meditate on the Lord, the Most Worthy and Generous Lord. ||1||Pause||
The heart-lotus of the self-willed manmukh is upside-down; his intellect is shallow; his mind is blind, and his head is entangled in worldly affairs.
Death and re-birth constantly hang over your head; without the Name, your neck shall be caught in the noose. ||2||
Your steps are unsteady, and your eyes are blind; you are not aware of the Word of the Shabad, O Sibling of Destiny.
The Shaastras and the Vedas keep the mortal bound to the three modes of Maya, and so he performs his deeds blindly. ||3||
He loses his capital - how can he earn any profit? The evil-minded person has no spiritual wisdom at all.
Contemplating the Shabad, he drinks in the sublime essence of the Lord; O Nanak, his faith is confirmed in the Truth. ||4||4||5||
Bhairao, First Mehl:
He remains with the Guru, day and night, and his tongue savors the savory taste of the Lord's Love.
He does not know any other; he realizes the Word of the Shabad. He knows and realizes the Lord deep within his own being. ||1||
Such a humble person is pleasing to my mind.
He conquers his self-conceit, and is imbued with the Infinite Lord. He serves the Guru. ||1||Pause||
Deep within my being, and outside as well, is the Immaculate Lord God. I bow humbly before that Primal Lord God.
Deep within each and every heart, and amidst all, the Embodiment of Truth is permeating and pervading. ||2||
