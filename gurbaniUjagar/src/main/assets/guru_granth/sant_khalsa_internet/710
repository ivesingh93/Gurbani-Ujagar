The burning fire has been put out; God Himself has saved me.
Meditate on that God, O Nanak, who created the universe. ||2||
Pauree:
When God becomes merciful, Maya does not cling.
Millions of sins are eliminated, by meditating on the Naam, the Name of the One Lord.
The body is made immaculate and pure, bathing in the dust of the feet of the Lord's humble servants.
The mind and body become contented, finding the Perfect Lord God.
One is saved, along with his family, and all his ancestors. ||18||
Shalok:
The Guru is the Lord of the Universe; the Guru is the Lord of the world; the Guru is the Perfect Pervading Lord God.
The Guru is compassionate; the Guru is all-powerful; the Guru, O Nanak, is the Saving Grace of sinners. ||1||
The Guru is the boat, to cross over the dangerous, treacherous, unfathomable world-ocean.
O Nanak, by perfect good karma, one is attached to the feet of the True Guru. ||2||
Pauree:
Blessed, blessed is the Divine Guru; associating with Him, one meditates on the Lord.
When the Guru becomes merciful, then all one's demerits are dispelled.
The Supreme Lord God, the Divine Guru, uplifts and exalts the lowly.
Cutting away the painful noose of Maya, He makes us His own slaves.
With my tongue, I sing the Glorious Praises of the infinite Lord God. ||19||
Shalok:
I see only the One Lord; I hear only the One Lord; the One Lord is all-pervading.
Nanak begs for the gift of the Naam; O Merciful Lord God, please grant Your Grace. ||1||
I serve the One Lord, I contemplate the One Lord, and to the One Lord, I offer my prayer.
Nanak has gathered in the wealth, the merchandise of the Naam; this is the true capital. ||2||
Pauree:
God is merciful and infinite. The One and Only is all-pervading.
He Himself is all-in-all. Who else can we speak of?
God Himself grants His gifts, and He Himself receives them.
Coming and going are all by the Hukam of Your Will; Your place is steady and unchanging.
Nanak begs for this gift; by Your Grace, Lord, please grant me Your Name. ||20||1||
Jaitsree, The Word Of The Devotees:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O my Lord and Master, I know nothing.
My mind has sold out, and is in Maya's hands. ||1||Pause||
You are called the Lord and Master, the Guru of the World.
I am called a lustful being of the Dark Age of Kali Yuga. ||1||
The five vices have corrupted my mind.
Moment by moment, they lead me further away from the Lord. ||2||
Wherever I look, I see loads of pain and suffering.
I do not have faith, even though the Vedas bear witness to the Lord. ||3||
Gautam's wife and the Lord Indra mated;
Shiva cut off Brahma's head, Brahma's head got stuck to Shiva's hand, and Indra came to bear the marks of a thousand female organs. ||4||
These demons have fooled, bound and destroyed me.
I am very shameless - even now, I am not tired of them. ||5||
Says Ravi Daas, what am I to do now?
Without the Sanctuary of the Lord's Protection, who else's should I seek? ||6||1||
