With your hands and feet, do all your work, but let your consciousness remain with the Immaculate Lord. ||213||
Fifth Mehl:
Kabeer, no one belongs to me, and I belong to no one else.
The One who created the creation - into Him I shall be absorbed. ||214||
Kabeer, the flour has fallen into the mud; nothing has come into my hands.
That which was eaten while it was being ground - that alone is of any use. ||215||
Kabeer, the mortal knows everything, and knowing, he still makes mistakes.
What good is a lamp in one's hand, if he falls into the well? ||216||
Kabeer, I am in love with the All-knowing Lord; the ignorant ones try to hold me back.
How could I ever break with the One, who owns our soul and breath of life. ||217||
Kabeer, why kill yourself for your love of decorations of your home and mansion?
In the end, only six feet, or a little more, shall be your lot. ||218||
Kabeer, whatever I wish for does not happen. What can I accomplish by merely thinking?
The Lord does whatever He wishes; it is not up to me at all. ||219||
Third Mehl:
God Himself makes the mortals anxious, and He Himself takes the anxiety away.
O Nanak, praise the One, who takes care of all. ||220||
Fifth Mehl:
Kabeer, the mortal does not remember the Lord; he wanders around, engrossed in greed.
Committing sins, he dies, and his life ends in an instant. ||221||
Kabeer, the body is like a clay vessel or a brittle metal pot.
If you wish to keep it safe and sound, then vibrate and meditate on the Lord; otherwise, the thing shall break. ||222||
Kabeer, chant the Name of the Beautifully-haired Lord; do not sleep unaware.
Chanting His Name night and day, the Lord will eventually hear your call. ||223||
Kabeer, the body is a banana forest, and the mind is an intoxicated elephant.
The jewel of spiritual wisdom is the prod, and the rare Saint is the rider. ||224||
Kabeer, the Lord's Name is the jewel, and the mouth is the purse; open this purse to the Appraiser.
If a buyer can be found, it will go for a high price. ||225||
Kabeer, the mortal does not know the Lord's Name, but he has raised a very large family.
He dies in the midst of his worldly affairs, and then he is not heard in the external world. ||226||
Kabeer, in the blink of an eye, moment by moment, life is passing by.
The mortal does not give up his worldly entanglements; the Messenger of Death walks in and beats the drum. ||227||
Kabeer, the Lord is the tree, and disillusionment with the world is the fruit.
The Holy man, who has abandoned useless arguments, is the shade of the tree. ||228||
Kabeer, plant the seeds of such a plant, which shall bear fruit throughout the twelve months,
with cooling shade and abundant fruit, upon which birds joyously play. ||229||
Kabeer, the Great Giver is the tree, which blesses all with the fruit of compassion.
When the birds migrate to other lands, O Tree, you bear the fruits. ||230||
Kabeer, the mortal finds the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, if he has such destiny written upon his forehead.
