His greatest greatness is that the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is in his heart.
The Beloved Lord God is his constant companion. ||1||
He alone is the Lord's slave, who remains dead while yet alive.
He looks upon pleasure and pain alike; by Guru's Grace, he is saved through the Word of the Shabad. ||1||Pause||
He does his deeds according to the Lord's Primal Command.
Without the Shabad, no one is approved.
Singing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises, the Naam abides within the mind.
He Himself gives His gifts, without hesitation. ||2||
The self-willed manmukh wanders around the world in doubt.
Without any capital, he makes false transactions.
Without any capital, he does not obtain any merchandise.
The mistaken manmukh wastes away his life. ||3||
One who serves the True Guru is the Lord's slave.
His social status is exalted, and his reputation is exalted.
Climbing the Guru's Ladder, he becomes the most exalted of all.
O Nanak, through the Naam, the Name of the Lord, greatness is obtained. ||4||7||46||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
The self-willed manmukh practices falsehood, only falsehood.
He never attains the Mansion of the Lord Presence.
Attached to duality, he wanders, deluded by doubt.
Entangled in worldly attachments, he comes and goes. ||1||
Behold, the decorations of the discarded bride!
Her consciousness is attached to children, spouse, wealth, and Maya, falsehood, emotional attachment, hypocrisy and corruption. ||1||Pause||
She who is pleasing to God is forever a happy soul-bride.
She makes the Word of the Guru's Shabad her decoration.
Her bed is so comfortable; she enjoys her Lord, night and day.
Meeting her Beloved, the obtains eternal peace. ||2||
She is a true, virtuous soul-bride, who enshrines love for the True Lord.
She keeps her Husband Lord always clasped to her heart.
She sees Him near at hand, ever-present.
My God is all-pervading everywhere. ||3||
Social status and beauty will not go with you hereafter.
As are the deeds done here, so does one become.
Through the Word of the Shabad, one becomes the highest of the high.
O Nanak, he is absorbed in the True Lord. ||4||8||47||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
The Lord's humble servant is imbued with devotional love, effortlessly and spontaneously.
Through awe and fear of the Guru, he is truly absorbed in the True One.
Without the Perfect Guru, devotional love is not obtained.
The self-willed manmukhs lose their honor, and cry out in pain. ||1||
O my mind, chant the Lord's Name, and meditate on Him forever.
You shall always be in ecstasy, day and night, and you shall obtain the fruits of your desires. ||1||Pause||
Through the Perfect Guru, the Perfect Lord is obtained,
and the Shabad, the True Name, is enshrined in the mind.
One who bathes in the Pool of Ambrosial Nectar becomes immaculately pure within.
He becomes forever sanctified, and is absorbed in the True Lord. ||2||
He sees the Lord God ever-present.
By Guru's Grace, he sees the Lord permeating and pervading everywhere.
Wherever I go, there I see Him.
Without the Guru, there is no other Giver. ||3||
The Guru is the ocean, the perfect treasure,
the most precious jewel and priceless ruby.
By Guru's Grace, the Great Giver blesses us;
O Nanak, the Forgiving Lord forgives us. ||4||9||48||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
The Guru is the Ocean; the True Guru is the Embodiment of Truth.
Through perfect good destiny, one serves the Guru.
He alone understands, whom the Lord Himself inspires to understand.
