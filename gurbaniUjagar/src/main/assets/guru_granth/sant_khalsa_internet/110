Center your awareness on seva-selfless service-and focus your consciousness on the Word of the Shabad.
Subduing your ego, you shall find a lasting peace, and your emotional attachment to Maya will be dispelled. ||1||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, I am totally devoted to the True Guru.
Through the Guru's Teachings, the Divine Light has dawned; I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, night and day. ||1||Pause||
Search your body and mind, and find the Name.
Restrain your wandering mind, and keep it in check.
Night and day, sing the Songs of the Guru's Bani; worship the Lord with intuitive devotion. ||2||
Within this body are countless objects.
The Gurmukh attains Truth, and comes to see them.
Beyond the nine gates, the Tenth Gate is found, and liberation is obtained. The Unstruck Melody of the Shabad vibrates. ||3||
True is the Master, and True is His Name.
By Guru's Grace, He comes to dwell within the mind.
Night and day, remain attuned to the Lord's Love forever, and you shall obtain understanding in the True Court. ||4||
Those who do not understand the nature of sin and virtue
are attached to duality; they wander around deluded.
The ignorant and blind people do not know the way; they come and go in reincarnation over and over again. ||5||
Serving the Guru, I have found eternal peace;
my ego has been silenced and subdued.
Through the Guru's Teachings, the darkness has been dispelled, and the heavy doors have been opened. ||6||
Subduing my ego, I have enshrined the Lord within my mind.
I focus my consciousness on the Guru's Feet forever.
By Guru's Grace, my mind and body are immaculate and pure; I meditate on the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||7||
From birth to death, everything is for You.
You bestow greatness upon those whom You have forgiven.
O Nanak, meditating forever on the Naam, you shall be blessed in both birth and death. ||8||1||2||
Maajh, Third Mehl:
My God is Immaculate, Inaccessible and Infinite.
Without a scale, He weighs the universe.
One who becomes Gurmukh, understands. Chanting His Glorious Praises, he is absorbed into the Lord of Virtue. ||1||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those whose minds are filled with the Name of the Lord.
Those who are committed to Truth remain awake and aware night and day. They are honored in the True Court. ||1||Pause||
He Himself hears, and He Himself sees.
Those, upon whom He casts His Glance of Grace, become acceptable.
They are attached, whom the Lord Himself attaches; as Gurmukh, they live the Truth. ||2||
Those whom the Lord Himself misleads-whose hand can they take?
That which is pre-ordained, cannot be erased.
Those who meet the True Guru are very fortunate and blessed; through perfect karma, He is met. ||3||
The young bride is fast asleep in her parents' home, night and day.
She has forgotten her Husband Lord; because of her faults and demerits, she is abandoned.
She wanders around continually, crying out, night and day. Without her Husband Lord, she cannot get any sleep. ||4||
In this world of her parents' home, she may come to know the Giver of peace,
if she subdues her ego, and recognizes the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Her bed is beautiful; she ravishes and enjoys her Husband Lord forever. She is adorned with the Decorations of Truth. ||5||
