I am a sacrifice to those who hear and chant the True Name.
Only one who obtains a room in the Mansion of the Lord's Presence is deemed to be truly intoxicated. ||2||
Bathe in the waters of Goodness and apply the scented oil of Truth to your body,
and your face shall become radiant. This is the gift of 100,000 gifts.
Tell your troubles to the One who is the Source of all comfort. ||3||
How can you forget the One who created your soul, and the praanaa, the breath of life?
Without Him, all that we wear and eat is impure.
Everything else is false. Whatever pleases Your Will is acceptable. ||4||5||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
Burn emotional attachment, and grind it into ink. Transform your intelligence into the purest of paper.
Make the love of the Lord your pen, and let your consciousness be the scribe. Then, seek the Guru's Instructions, and record these deliberations.
Write the Praises of the Naam, the Name of the Lord; write over and over again that He has no end or limitation. ||1||
O Baba, write such an account,
that when it is asked for, it will bring the Mark of Truth. ||1||Pause||
There, where greatness, eternal peace and everlasting joy are bestowed,
the faces of those whose minds are attuned to the True Name are anointed with the Mark of Grace.
If one receives God's Grace, then such honors are received, and not by mere words. ||2||
Some come, and some arise and depart. They give themselves lofty names.
Some are born beggars, and some hold vast courts.
Going to the world hereafter, everyone shall realize that without the Name, it is all useless. ||3||
I am terrified by the Fear of You, God. Bothered and bewildered, my body is wasting away.
Those who are known as sultans and emperors shall be reduced to dust in the end.
O Nanak, arising and departing, all false attachments are cut away. ||4||6||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
Believing, all tastes are sweet. Hearing, the salty flavors are tasted;
chanting with one's mouth, the spicy flavors are savored. All these spices have been made from the Sound-current of the Naad.
The thirty-six flavors of ambrosial nectar are in the Love of the One Lord; they are tasted only by one who is blessed by His Glance of Grace. ||1||
O Baba, the pleasures of other foods are false.
Eating them, the body is ruined, and wickedness and corruption enter into the mind. ||1||Pause||
My mind is imbued with the Lord's Love; it is dyed a deep crimson. Truth and charity are my white clothes.
The blackness of sin is erased by my wearing of blue clothes, and meditation on the Lord's Lotus Feet is my robe of honor.
Contentment is my cummerbund, Your Name is my wealth and youth. ||2||
O Baba, the pleasures of other clothes are false.
Wearing them, the body is ruined, and wickedness and corruption enter into the mind. ||1||Pause||
The understanding of Your Way, Lord, is horses, saddles and bags of gold for me.
The pursuit of virtue is my bow and arrow, my quiver, sword and scabbard.
To be distinguished with honor is my drum and banner. Your Mercy is my social status. ||3||
O Baba, the pleasures of other rides are false.
By such rides, the body is ruined, and wickedness and corruption enter into the mind. ||1||Pause||
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the pleasure of houses and mansions. Your Glance of Grace is my family, Lord.
