Gond, Fifth Mehl:
I am a sacrifice to the Saints.
Associating with the Saints, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
By the Grace of the Saints, all the sins are taken away.
By great good fortune, one finds the Sanctuary of the Saints. ||1||
Meditating on the Lord, no obstacles will block your way.
By Guru's Grace, meditate on God. ||1||Pause||
When the Supreme Lord God becomes merciful,
he makes me the dust of the feet of the Holy.
Sexual desire and anger leave his body,
and the Lord, the jewel, comes to dwell in his mind. ||2||
Fruitful and approved is the life of one
who knows the Supreme Lord God to be close.
One who is committed to loving devotional worship of God, and the Kirtan of His Praises,
awakens from the sleep of countless incarnations. ||3||
The Lord's Lotus Feet are the Support of His humble servant.
To chant the Praises of the Lord of the Universe is the true trade.
Please fulfill the hopes of Your humble slave.
Nanak finds peace in the dust of the feet of the humble. ||4||20||22||6||28||
Raag Gond, Ashtapadees, Fifth Mehl, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Humbly bow to the Perfect Divine Guru.
Fruitful is His image, and fruitful is service to Him.
He is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, the Architect of Destiny.
Twenty-four hours a day, he remains imbued with the love of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||
The Guru is the Lord of the Universe, the Guru is the Lord of the World.
He is the Saving Grace of His slaves. ||1||Pause||
He satisfies the kings, emperors and nobles.
He destroys the egotistical villains.
He puts illness into the mouths of the slanderers.
All the people celebrate His victory. ||2||
Supreme bliss fills the minds of the Saints.
The Saints meditate on the Divine Guru, the Lord God.
The faces of His companions become radiant and bright.
The slanderers lose all places of rest. ||3||
With each and every breath, the Lord's humble slaves praise Him.
The Supreme Lord God and the Guru are care-free.
All fears are eradicated, in His Sanctuary.
Smashing all the slanderers, the Lord knocks them to the ground. ||4||
Let no one slander the Lord's humble servants.
Whoever does so, will be miserable.
Twenty-four hours a day, the Lord's humble servant meditates on Him alone.
The Messenger of Death does not even approach him. ||5||
The Lord's humble servant has no vengeance. The slanderer is egotistical.
The Lord's humble servant wishes well, while the slanderer dwells on evil.
The Sikh of the Guru meditates on the True Guru.
The Lord's humble servants are saved, while the slanderer is cast into hell. ||6||
Listen, O my beloved friends and companions:
these words shall be true in the Court of the Lord.
As you plant, so shall you harvest.
The proud, egotistical person will surely be uprooted. ||7||
O True Guru, You are the Support of the unsupported.
Be merciful, and save Your humble servant.
Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to the Guru;
remembering Him in meditation, my honor has been saved. ||8||1||29||
