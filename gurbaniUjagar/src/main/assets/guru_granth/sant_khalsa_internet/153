Those who are committed to the Naam, see the world as merely a temporary pasture.
Sexual desire and anger are broken, like a jar of poison.
Without the merchandise of the Name, the house of the body and the store of the mind are empty.
Meeting the Guru, the hard and heavy doors are opened. ||4||
One meets the Holy Saint only through perfect destiny.
The Lord's perfect people rejoice in the Truth.
Surrendering their minds and bodies, they find the Lord with intuitive ease.
Nanak falls at their feet. ||5||6||
Gauree, First Mehl:
The conscious mind is engrossed in sexual desire, anger and Maya.
The conscious mind is awake only to falsehood, corruption and attachment.
It gathers in the assets of sin and greed.
So swim across the river of life, O my mind, with the Sacred Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||
Waaho! Waaho! - Great! Great is my True Lord! I seek Your All-powerful Support.
I am a sinner - You alone are pure. ||1||Pause||
Fire and water join together, and the breath roars in its fury!
The tongue and the sex organs each seek to taste.
The eyes which look upon corruption do not know the Love and the Fear of God.
Conquering self-conceit, one obtains the Name. ||2||
One who dies in the Word of the Shabad, shall never again have to die.
Without such a death, how can one attain perfection?
The mind is engrossed in deception, treachery and duality.
Whatever the Immortal Lord does, comes to pass. ||3||
So get aboard that boat when your turn comes.
Those who fail to embark upon that boat shall be beaten in the Court of the Lord.
Blessed is that Gurdwara, the Guru's Gate, where the Praises of the True Lord are sung.
O Nanak, the One Creator Lord is pervading hearth and home. ||4||7||
Gauree, First Mehl:
The inverted heart-lotus has been turned upright, through reflective meditation on God.
From the Sky of the Tenth Gate, the Ambrosial Nectar trickles down.
The Lord Himself is pervading the three worlds. ||1||
O my mind, do not give in to doubt.
When the mind surrenders to the Name, it drinks in the essence of Ambrosial Nectar. ||1||Pause||
So win the game of life; let your mind surrender and accept death.
When the self dies, the individual mind comes to know the Supreme Mind.
As the inner vision is awakened, one comes to know one's own home, deep within the self. ||2||
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is austerity, chastity and cleansing baths at sacred shrines of pilgrimage.
What good are ostentatious displays?
The All-pervading Lord is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. ||3||
If I had faith in someone else, then I would go to that one's house.
But where should I go, to beg? There is no other place for me.
O Nanak, through the Guru's Teachings, I am intuitively absorbed in the Lord. ||4||8||
Gauree, First Mehl:
Meeting the True Guru, we are shown the way to die.
Remaining alive in this death brings joy deep within.
Overcoming egotistical pride, the Tenth Gate is found. ||1||
Death is pre-ordained - no one who comes can remain here.
So chant and meditate on the Lord, and remain in the Sanctuary of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Meeting the True Guru, duality is dispelled.
The heart-lotus blossoms forth, and the mind is attached to the Lord God.
One who remains dead while yet alive obtains the greatest happiness hereafter. ||2||
Meeting the True Guru, one becomes truthful, chaste and pure.
Climbing up the steps of the Guru's Path, one becomes the highest of the high.
When the Lord grants His Mercy, the fear of death is conquered. ||3||
Uniting in Guru's Union, we are absorbed in His Loving Embrace.
Granting His Grace, He reveals the Mansion of His Presence, within the home of the self.
O Nanak, conquering egotism, we are absorbed into the Lord. ||4||9||
