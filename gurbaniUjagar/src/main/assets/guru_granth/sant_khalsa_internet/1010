The world is chasing after worldly affairs; caught and bound, it does not understand contemplative meditation.
The foolish, ignorant, self-willed manmukh has forgotten birth and death.
Those whom the Guru has protected are saved, contemplating the True Word of the Shabad. ||7||
In the cage of divine love, the parrot, speaks.
It pecks at the Truth, and drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar; it flies away, only once.
Meeting with the Guru, one recognizes his Lord and Master; says Nanak, he finds the gate of liberation. ||8||2||
Maaroo, First Mehl:
One who dies in the Word of the Shabad conquers death; otherwise, where can you run?
Through the Fear of God, fear runs away; His Name is Ambrosial Nectar.
You alone kill and protect; except for You, there is no place at all. ||1||
O Baba, I am filthy, shallow and totally without understanding.
Without the Naam, no one is anything; the Perfect Guru has made my intellect perfect. ||1||Pause||
I am full of faults, and I have no virtue at all. Without virtues, how can I go home?
Through the Word of the Shabad, intuitive peace wells up; without good destiny, the wealth is not obtained.
Those whose minds are not filled with the Naam are bound and gagged, and suffer in pain. ||2||
Those who have forgotten the Naam - why have they even come into the world?
Here and hereafter, they do not find any peace; they have loaded their carts with ashes.
Those who are separated, do not meet with the Lord; they suffer in terrible pain at Death's Door. ||3||
I do not know what will happen in the world hereafter; I am so confused - please teach me, Lord!
I am confused; I would fall at the feet of one who shows me the Way.
Without the Guru, there is no giver at all; His value cannot be described. ||4||
If I see my friend, then I will embrace Him; I have sent Him the letter of Truth.
His soul-bride stands waiting expectantly; as Gurmukh, I see Him with my eyes.
By the Pleasure of Your Will, You abide in my mind, and bless me with Your Glance of Grace. ||5||
One who is wandering hungry and thirsty - what can he give, and what can anyone ask from him?
I cannot conceive of any other, who can bless my mind and body with perfection.
The One who created me takes care of me; He Himself blesses me with glory. ||6||
In the body-village is my Lord and Master, whose body is ever-new, Innocent and child-like, incomparably playful.
He is neither a woman, nor a man, nor a bird; the True Lord is so wise and beautiful.
Whatever pleases Him, happens; You are the lamp, and You are the incense. ||7||
He hears the songs and tastes the flavors, but these flavors are useless and insipid, and bring only disease to the body.
One who loves the Truth and speaks the Truth, escapes from the sorrow of separation.
Nanak does not forget the Naam; whatever happens is by the Lord's Will. ||8||3||
Maaroo, First Mehl:
Practice Truth - other greed and attachments are useless.
The True Lord has fascinated this mind, and my tongue enjoys the taste of Truth.
Without the Name, there is no juice; the others depart, loaded with poison. ||1||
I am such a slave of Yours, O my Beloved Lord and Master.
I walk in harmony with Your Command, O my True, Sweet Beloved. ||1||Pause||
Night and day, the slave works for his overlord.
I have sold my mind for the Word of the Guru's Shabad; my mind is comforted and consoled by the Shabad.
