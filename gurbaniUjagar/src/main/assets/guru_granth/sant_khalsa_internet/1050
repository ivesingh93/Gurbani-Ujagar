The Gurmukh knows the spiritual wisdom of the One Lord. Night and day, he chants the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||13||
He may read the Vedas, but he does not realize the Lord's Name.
For the sake of Maya, he reads and recites and argues.
The ignorant and blind person is filled with filth within. How can he cross over the impassable world-ocean? ||14||
He voices all the controversies of the Vedas,
but his inner being is not saturated or satisfied, and he does not realize the Word of the Shabad.
The Vedas tell all about virtue and vice, but only the Gurmukh drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar. ||15||
The One True Lord is all by Himself.
There is no one else except Him.
O Nanak, true is the mind of one who is attuned to the Naam; he speaks Truth, and nothing but Truth. ||16||6||
Maaroo, Third Mehl:
The True Lord has established the Throne of Truth.
He dwells in His own home deep within the self, where there is no emotional attachment to Maya.
The True Lord dwells deep within the nucleus of the Gurmukh's heart forever; his actions are excellent. ||1||
True is his merchandise, and true is his trade.
There is no doubt within him, and no expanse of duality.
He has earned the true wealth, which is never exhausted. How few are those who contemplate this, and understand. ||2||
They alone are attached to the True Name, whom the Lord Himself attaches.
The Word of the Shabad is deep within the nucleus of the self; good fortune is recorded upon their foreheads.
Through the True Word of the Shabad, they sing the True Praises of the Lord; they are attuned to contemplative meditation on the Shabad. ||3||
I praise the True Lord, the Truest of the True.
I see the One Lord, and no other.
The Guru's Teachings are the ladder to reach the highest of the high. the jewel of spiritual wisdom conquers egotism. ||4||
Emotional attachment to Maya is burnt away by the Word of the Shabad.
The True One comes to dwell in the mind, when it pleases You, O Lord.
True are all the actions of the truthful; the thirst of egotism is subdued. ||5||
All by Himself, God created emotional attachment to Maya.
How rare are those who, as Gurmukh, realize the Lord.
One who becomes Gurmukh practices Truth; true and excellent are his actions. ||6||
He does those deeds which are pleasing to my God;
through the Shabad, he burns away egotism and the thirst of desire.
Following the Guru's Teachings, he remains forever cool and calm deep within; he conquers and subdues his ego. ||7||
Those who are attached to the Truth are pleased with everything.
They are embellished with the True Word of the Shabad.
Those who are true in this world, are true in the Court of the Lord. The Merciful Lord adorns them with His Mercy. ||8||
Those who are attached to duality, and not the Truth,
are trapped in emotional attachment to Maya; they totally suffer in pain.
Without the Guru, they do not understand pain and pleasure; attached to Maya, they suffer in terrible pain. ||9||
Those whose minds are pleased with the True Word of the Shabad
act according to pre-ordained destiny.
They serve the True Lord, and meditate on the True Lord; they are imbued with contemplative meditation on the True Lord. ||10||
Service to the Guru seems sweet to them.
Night and day, they are intuitively immersed in celestial peace.
Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, their minds become immaculate; they love to serve the Guru. ||11||
Those humble beings are at peace, whom the True Guru attaches to the Truth.
He Himself, in His Will, merges them into Himself.
Those humble beings, whom the True Guru protects, are saved. The rest are ruined through emotional attachment to Maya. ||12||
