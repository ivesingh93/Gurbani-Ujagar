Those whose minds are filled with the Naam are beautiful; they enshrine the Naam within their hearts. ||3||
The True Guru has revealed to me the Lord's Home and His Court, and the Mansion of His Presence. I joyfully enjoy His Love.
Whatever He says, I accept as good; Nanak chants the Naam. ||4||6||16||
Bhairao, Third Mehl:
The desires of the mind are absorbed in the mind, contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Understanding is obtained from the Perfect Guru, and then the mortal does not die over and over again. ||1||
My mind takes the Support of the Lord's Name.
By Guru's Grace, I have obtained the supreme status; the Lord is the Fulfiller of all desires. ||1||Pause||
The One Lord is permeating and pervading amongst all; without the Guru, this understanding is not obtained.
My Lord God has been revealed to me, and I have become Gurmukh. Night and day, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||2||
The One Lord is the Giver of peace; peace is not found anywhere else.
Those who do not serve the Giver, the True Guru, depart regretfully in the end. ||3||
Serving the True Guru, lasting peace is obtained, and the mortal does not suffer in pain any longer.
Nanak has been blessed with devotional worship of the Lord; his light has merged into the Light. ||4||7||17||
Bhairao, Third Mehl:
Without the Guru, the world is insane; confused and deluded, it is beaten, and it suffers.
It dies and dies again, and is reborn, always in pain, but it is unaware of the Lord's Gate. ||1||
O my mind, remain always in the Protection of the True Guru's Sanctuary.
Those people, to whose hearts the Lord's Name seems sweet, are carried across the terrifying world-ocean by the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||1||Pause||
The mortal wears various religious robes, but his consciousness is unsteady; deep within, he is filled with sexual desire, anger and egotism.
Deep within is the great thirst and immense hunger; he wanders from door to door. ||2||
Those who die in the Word of the Guru's Shabad are reborn; they find the door of liberation.
With constant peace and tranquility deep within, they enshrine the Lord within their hearts. ||3||
As it pleases Him, He inspires us to act. Nothing else can be done.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh contemplates the Word of the Shabad, and is blessed with the glorious greatness of the Lord's Name. ||4||8||18||
Bhairao, Third Mehl:
Lost in egotism, Maya and attachment, the mortal earns pain, and eats pain.
The great disease, the rabid disease of greed, is deep within him; he wanders around indiscriminately. ||1||
The life of the self-willed manmukh in this world is cursed.
He does not remember the Lord's Name, even in his dreams. He is never in love with the Lord's Name. ||1||Pause||
He acts like a beast, and does not understand anything. Practicing falsehood, he becomes false.
But when the mortal meets the True Guru, his way of looking at the world changes. How rare are those humble beings who seek and find the Lord. ||2||
That person, whose heart is forever filled with the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, obtains the Lord, the Treasure of Virtue.
By Guru's Grace, he finds the Perfect Lord; the egotistical pride of his mind is eradicated. ||3||
The Creator Himself acts, and causes all to act. He Himself places us on the path.
