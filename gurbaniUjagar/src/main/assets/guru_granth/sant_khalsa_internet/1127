Those who are imbued with Truth - their tongues are tinged with Truth; they do not have even an iota of the filth of falsehood.
They taste the sweet Ambrosial Nectar of the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord; imbued with the Shabad, they are blessed with honor. ||3||
The virtuous meet with the virtuous, and earn the profit; as Gurmukh, they obtain the glorious greatness of the Naam.
All sorrows are erased, by serving the Guru; O Nanak, the Naam is our only Friend and Companion. ||4||5||6||
Bhairao, First Mehl:
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the wealth and support of all; It is enshrined in the heart, by Guru's Grace.
One who gathers this imperishable wealth is fulfilled, and through intuitive meditation, is lovingly focused on the Lord. ||1||
O mortal, focus your consciousness on devotional worship of the Lord.
As Gurmukh, meditate on the Name of the Lord in your heart, and you shall return to your home with intuitive ease. ||1||Pause||
Doubt, separation and fear are never eradicated, and the mortal continues coming and going in reincarnation, as long as he does not know the Lord.
Without the Name of the Lord, no one is liberated; they drown and die without water. ||2||
Busy with his worldly affairs, all honor is lost; the ignorant one is not rid of his doubts.
Without the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the mortal is never liberated; he remains blindly entangled in the expanse of worldly affairs. ||3||
My mind is pleased and appeased with the Immaculate Lord, who has no ancestry. Through the mind itself, the mind is subdued.
Deep within my being, and outside as well, I know only the One Lord. O Nanak, there is no other at all. ||4||6||7||
Bhairao, First Mehl:
You may give feasts, make burnt offerings, donate to charity, perform austere penance and worship, and endure pain and suffering in the body.
But without the Lord's Name, liberation is not obtained. As Gurmukh, obtain the Naam and liberation. ||1||
Without the Lord's Name, birth into the world is useless.
Without the Name, the mortal eats poison and speaks poisonous words; he dies fruitlessly, and wanders in reincarnation. ||1||Pause||
The mortal may read scriptures, study grammar and say his prayers three times a day.
Without the Word of the Guru's Shabad, where is liberation, O mortal? Without the Lord's Name, the mortal is entangled and dies. ||2||
Walking sticks, begging bowls, hair tufts, sacred threads, loin cloths, pilgrimages to sacred shrines and wandering all around-
without the Lord's Name, peace and tranquility are not obtained. One who chants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, crosses over to the other side. ||3||
The mortal's hair may be matted and tangled upon his head, and he may smear his body with ashes; he may take off his clothes and go naked.
But without the Lord's Name, he is not satisfied; he wears religious robes, but he is bound by the karma of the actions he committed in past lives. ||4||
As many beings and creatures as there are in the water, on the land and in the sky - wherever they are, You are with them all, O Lord.
By Guru's Grace, please preserve Your humble servant; O Lord, Nanak stirs up this juice, and drinks it in. ||5||7||8||
Raag Bhairao, Third Mehl, Chaupadas, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
No one should be proud of his social class and status.
He alone is a Brahmin, who knows God. ||1||
Do not be proud of your social class and status, you ignorant fool!
