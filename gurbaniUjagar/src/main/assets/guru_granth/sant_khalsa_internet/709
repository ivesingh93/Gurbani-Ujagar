By body is sanctified, by the dust of Your feet.
O Supreme Lord God, Divine Guru, You are always with me, ever-present. ||13||
Shalok:
With my tongue, I chant the Lord's Name; with my ears, I listen to the Ambrosial Word of His Shabad.
Nanak is forever a sacrifice to those who meditate on the Supreme Lord God. ||1||
All concerns are false, except those of the One Lord.
O Nanak, blessed are those, who are in love with their True Lord. ||2||
Pauree:
I am forever a sacrifice to those who listen to the sermon of the Lord.
Those who bow their heads before God are perfect and distinguished.
Those hands, which write the Praises of the infinite Lord are beautiful.
Those feet which walk on God's Path are pure and holy.
In the Society of the Saints, they are emancipated; all their sorrows depart. ||14||
Shalok:
One's destiny is activated, when one chants the Lord's Name, through perfect good fortune.
Fruitful is that moment, O Nanak, when one obtains the Blessed Vision of the Darshan of the Lord of the Universe. ||1||
Its value cannot be estimated; it brings peace beyond measure.
O Nanak, that time alone is approved, when my Beloved meets with me. ||2||
Pauree:
Tell me, what is that time, when I shall find God?
Blessed and auspicious is that moment, and that destiny, when I shall find the Lord of the Universe.
Meditating on the Lord, twenty-four hours a day, my mind's desires are fulfilled.
By great good fortune, I have found the Society of the Saints; I bow and touch their feet.
My mind thirsts for the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan; Nanak is a sacrifice to Him. ||15||
Shalok:
The Lord of the Universe is the Purifier of sinners; He is the Dispeller of all distress.
The Lord God is Mighty, giving His Protective Sanctuary; Nanak chants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||
Renouncing all self-conceit, I hold tight to the Lord's Feet.
My sorrows and troubles have departed, O Nanak, beholding God. ||2||
Pauree:
Unite with me, O Merciful Lord; I have fallen at Your Door.
O Merciful to the meek, save me. I have wandered enough; now I am tired.
It is Your very nature to love Your devotees, and save sinners.
Without You, there is no other at all; I offer this prayer to You.
Take me by the hand, O Merciful Lord, and carry me across the world-ocean. ||16||
Shalok:
The Merciful Lord is the Savior of the Saints; their only support is to sing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises.
One becomes immaculate and pure, by associating with the Saints, O Nanak, and taking the Protection of the Transcendent Lord. ||1||
The burning of the heart is not dispelled at all, by sandalwood paste, the moon, or the cold season.
It only becomes cool, O Nanak, by chanting the Name of the Lord. ||2||
Pauree:
Through the Protection and Support of the Lord's lotus feet, all beings are saved.
Hearing of the Glory of the Lord of the Universe, the mind becomes fearless.
Nothing at all is lacking, when one gathers the wealth of the Naam.
The Society of the Saints is obtained, by very good deeds.
Twenty-four hours a day, meditate on the Lord, and listen continually to the Lord's Praises. ||17||
Shalok:
The Lord grants His Grace, and dispels the pains of those who sing the Kirtan of the Praises of His Name.
When the Lord God shows His Kindness, O Nanak, one is no longer engrossed in Maya. ||1||
