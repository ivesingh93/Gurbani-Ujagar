Soohee, First Mehl, Sixth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Bronze is bright and shiny, but when it is rubbed, its blackness appears.
Washing it, its impurity is not removed, even if it is washed a hundred times. ||1||
They alone are my friends, who travel along with me;
and in that place, where the accounts are called for, they appear standing with me. ||1||Pause||
There are houses, mansions and tall buildings, painted on all sides;
but they are empty within, and they crumble like useless ruins. ||2||
The herons in their white feathers dwell in the sacred shrines of pilgrimage.
They tear apart and eat the living beings, and so they are not called white. ||3||
My body is like the simmal tree; seeing me, other people are fooled.
Its fruits are useless - just like the qualities of my body. ||4||
The blind man is carrying such a heavy load, and his journey through the mountains is so long.
My eyes can see, but I cannot find the Way. How can I climb up and cross over the mountain? ||5||
What good does it do to serve, and be good, and be clever?
O Nanak, contemplate the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and you shall be released from bondage. ||6||1||3||
Soohee, First Mehl:
Build the raft of meditation and self-discipline, to carry you across the river.
There will be no ocean, and no rising tides to stop you; this is how comfortable your path shall be. ||1||
Your Name alone is the color, in which the robe of my body is dyed. This color is permanent, O my Beloved. ||1||Pause||
My beloved friends have departed; how will they meet the Lord?
If they have virtue in their pack, the Lord will unite them with Himself. ||2||
Once united with Him, they will not be separated again, if they are truly united.
The True Lord brings their comings and goings to an end. ||3||
One who subdues and eradicates egotism, sews the robe of devotion.
Following the Word of the Guru's Teachings, she receives the fruits of her reward, the Ambrosial Words of the Lord. ||4||
Says Nanak, O soul-brides, our Husband Lord is so dear!
We are the servants, the hand-maidens of the Lord; He is our True Lord and Master. ||5||2||4||
Soohee, First Mehl:
Those whose minds are filled with love of the Lord, are blessed and exalted.
They are blessed with peace, and their pains are forgotten.
He will undoubtedly, certainly save them. ||1||
The Guru comes to meet those whose destiny is so pre-ordained.
He blesses them with the Teachings of the Ambrosial Name of the Lord.
Those who walk in the Will of the True Guru, never wander begging. ||2||
And one who lives in the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, why should he bow down to any other?
The gate-keeper at the Lord's Gate shall not stop him to ask any questions.
And one who is blessed with the Lord's Glance of Grace - by his words, others are emancipated as well. ||3||
The Lord Himself sends out, and recalls the mortal beings; no one else gives Him advice.
He Himself demolishes, constructs and creates; He knows everything.
O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord is the blessing, given to those who receive His Mercy, and His Grace. ||4||3||5||
