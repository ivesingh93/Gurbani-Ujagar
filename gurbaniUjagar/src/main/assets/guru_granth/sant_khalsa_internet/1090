Pauree:
He created both sides; Shiva dwells within Shakti (the soul dwells within the material universe).
Through the material universe of Shakti, no one has ever found the Lord; they continue to be born and dIE in reincarnation.
Serving the Guru, peace is found, meditating on the Lord with every breath and morsel of food.
Searching and looking through the Simritees and the Shaastras, I have found that the most sublime person is the slave of the Lord.
O Nanak, without the Naam, nothing is permanent and stable; I am a sacrifice to the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||10||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
I might become a Pandit, a religious scholar, or an astrologer, and recite the four Vedas with my mouth;
I might be worshipped throughout the nine regions of the earth for my wisdom and thought;
let me not forget the Word of Truth, that no one can touch my sacred cooking square.
Such cooking squares are false, O Nanak; only the One Lord is True. ||1||
Third Mehl:
He Himself creates and He Himself acts; He bestows His Glance of Grace.
He Himself grants glorious greatness; says Nanak, He is the True Lord. ||2||
Pauree:
Only death is painful; I cannot conceive of anything else as painful.
It is unstoppable; it stalks and pervades the world, and fights with the sinners.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, one is immersed in the Lord. Meditating on the Lord, one comes to realize the Lord.
He alone is emancipated in the Sanctuary of the Lord, who struggles with his own mind.
One who contemplates and meditates on the Lord in his mind, succeeds in the Court of the Lord. ||11||
Shalok, First Mehl:
Submit to the Will of the Lord Commander; in His Court, only Truth is accepted.
Your Lord and Master shall call you to account; do not go astray on beholding the world.
One who keeps watch over his heart, and keeps his heart pure, is a dervish, a saintly devotee.
Love and affection, O Nanak, are in the accounts placed before the Creator. ||1||
First Mehl:
One who is unattached like the bumble bee, sees the Lord of the world everywhere.
The diamond of his mind is pierced through with the Diamond of the Lord's Name; O Nanak, his neck is embellished with it. ||2||
Pauree:
The self-willed manmukhs are afflicted by death; they cling to Maya in emotional attachment.
In an instant, they are thrown to the ground and killed; in the love of duality, they are deluded.
This opportunity shall not come into their hands again; they are beaten by the Messenger of Death with his stick.
But Death's stick does not even strike those who remain awake and aware in the Love of the Lord.
All are Yours, and cling to You; only You can save them. ||12||
Shalok, First Mehl:
See the imperishable Lord everywhere; attachment to wealth brings only great pain.
Loaded with dust, you have to cross over the world-ocean; you are not carrying the profit and capital of the Name with you. ||1||
First Mehl:
My capital is Your True Name, O Lord; this wealth is inexhaustible and infinite.
O Nanak, this merchandise is immaculate; blessed is the banker who trades in it. ||2||
First Mehl:
Know and enjoy the primal, eternal Love of the Great Lord and Master.
Blessed with the Naam, O Nanak, you shall strike down the Messenger of Death, and push his face to the ground. ||3||
Pauree:
He Himself has embellished the body, and placed the nine treasures of the Naam within it.
He confuses some in doubt; fruitless are their actions.
Some, as Gurmukh, realize their Lord, the Supreme Soul.
Some listen to the Lord, and obey Him; sublime and exalted are their actions.
Love for the Lord wells up deep within, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord's Name. ||13||
Shalok, First Mehl:
