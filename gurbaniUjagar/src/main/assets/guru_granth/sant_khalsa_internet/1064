One who is pleased with Your Will is immersed in You.
Glorious greatness rests in God's Will; rare are those who accept it. ||3||
When it pleases His Will, He leads us to meet the Guru.
The Gurmukh finds the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
By Your Will, You created the whole Universe; those whom You bless with Your favor are pleased with Your Will. ||4||
The blind, self-willed manmukhs practice cleverness.
They do not surrender to the Lord's Will, and suffer terrible pain.
Deluded by doubt, they come and go in reincarnation; they never find the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. ||5||
The True Guru brings Union, and grants glorious greatness.
The Primal Lord ordained service to the True Guru.
Serving the True Guru, the Naam is obtained. Through the Naam, one finds peace. ||6||
Everything wells up from the Naam, and through the Naam, perishes.
By Guru's Grace, the mind and body are pleased with the Naam.
Meditating on the Naam, the tongue is drenched with the Lord's sublime essence. Through this essence, the Essence is obtained. ||7||
Rare are those who find the Mansion of the Lord's Presence within the mansion of their own body.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they lovingly focus their consciousness on the True Lord.
Whoever the Lord blesses with Truth obtains Truth; he merges in Truth, and only Truth. ||8||
Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the mind and body suffer in pain.
Attached to the love of Maya, he earns nothing but disease.
Without the Name, his mind and body are afflicted with leprosy, and he obtains his home in hell. ||9||
Those who are imbued with the Naam - their bodies are immaculate and pure.
Their soul-swan is immaculate, and in the Lord's Love, they find eternal peace.
Praising the Naam, they find eternal peace, and dwell in the home of their own inner being. ||10||
Everyone deals and trades.
Without the Name, all the world loses.
Naked they come, and naked they go; without the Name, they suffer in pain. ||11||
He alone obtains the Naam, unto whom the Lord gives it.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Lord comes to dwell in the mind.
By Guru's Grace, the Naam dwells deep within the heart, and one meditates upon the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||12||
Everyone who comes into the world, longs for the Name.
They alone are blessed with the Name, whose past actions were so ordained by the Primal Lord.
Those who obtain the Name are very fortunate. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they are united with God. ||13||
Utterly incomparable is the fortress of the body.
Within it, God sits in contemplation.
He administers true justice, and trades in Truth; through Him, one finds the eternal, unchanging dwelling. ||14||
Deep within the inner self are glorious homes and beautiful places.
But rare is that person who, as Gurmukh, finds these places.
If one stays in these places, and praises the True Lord, the True Lord comes to dwell in the mind. ||15||
My Creator Lord has formed this formation.
He has placed everything within this body.
O Nanak, those who deal in the Naam are imbued with His Love. The Gurmukh obtains the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||16||6||20||
Maaroo, Third Mehl:
Contemplating the Word of the Shabad, the body becomes golden.
The Lord abides there; He has no end or limitation.
Night and day, serve the Lord, and chant the True Word of the Guru's Bani. Through the Shabad, meet the Dear Lord. ||1||
