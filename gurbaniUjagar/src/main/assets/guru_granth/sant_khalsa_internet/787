By wearing her red dress, no one has found her Husband Lord; the self-willed manmukh is burnt to death.
Meeting the True Guru, she discards her red dress, and eradicates egotism from within.
Her mind and body are imbued with the deep red color of His Love, and her tongue is imbued, singing His Praises and excellences.
She becomes His soul-bride forever, with the Word of the Shabad in her mind; she makes the Fear of God and the Love of God her ornaments and decorations.
O Nanak, by His Merciful Grace, she obtains the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, and keeps Him enshrined in her heart. ||1||
Third Mehl:
O bride, forsake your red dress, and decorate yourself with the crimson color of His Love.
Your comings and goings shall be forgotten, contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
The soul-bride is adorned and beautiful; the Celestial Lord, her Husband, abides in her home.
O Nanak, the bride ravishes and enjoys Him; and He, the Ravisher, ravishes and enjoys her. ||2||
Pauree:
The foolish, self-willed manmukh is engrossed in false attachment to family.
Practicing egotism and self-conceit, he dies and departs, taking nothing along with him.
He does not understand that the Messenger of Death is hovering over his head; he is deluded by duality.
This opportunity will not come into his hands again; the Messenger of Death will seize him.
He acts according to his pre-ordained destiny. ||5||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Do not call them 'satee', who burn themselves along with their husbands' corpses.
O Nanak, they alone are known as 'satee', who dIE from the shock of separation. ||1||
Third Mehl:
They are also known as 'satee', who abide in modesty and contentment.
They serve their Lord, and rise in the early hours to contemplate Him. ||2||
Third Mehl:
The widows burn themselves in the fire, along with their husbands' corpses.
If they truly knew their husbands, then they suffer terrible bodily pain.
O Nanak, if they did not truly know their husbands, why should they burn themselves in the fire?
Whether their husbands are alive or dead, those wives remain far away from them. ||3||
Pauree:
You created pain along with pleasure; O Creator, such is the writ You have written.
There is no other gift as great as the Name; it has no form or sign.
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is an inexhaustible treasure; it abides in the mind of the Gurmukh.
In His Mercy, He blesses us with the Naam, and then, the writ of pain and pleasure is not written.
Those humble servants who serve with love, meet the Lord, chanting the Chant of the Lord. ||6||
Shalok, Second Mehl:
They know that they will have to depart, so why do they make such ostentatious displays?
Those who do not know that they will have to depart, continue to arrange their affairs. ||1||
Second Mehl:
He accumulates wealth during the night of his life, but in the morning, he must depart.
O Nanak, it shall not go along with him, and so he regrets. ||2||
Second Mehl:
Paying a fine under pressure, does not bring either merit or goodness.
That alone is a good deed, O Nanak, which is done by one's own free will. ||3||
Second Mehl:
Stubborn-mindedness will not win the Lord to one's side, no matter how much it is tried.
The Lord is won over to your side, by offering Him your true love, O servant Nanak, and contemplating the Word of the Shabad. ||4||
Pauree:
The Creator created the world; He alone understands it.
He Himself created the Universe, and He Himself shall destroy it afterwards.
