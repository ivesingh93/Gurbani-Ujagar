With His Feet, He has fascinated my mind; as His humble servant, I am intoxicated with love for His Name.
O Nanak, my Beloved is forever Merciful; out of millions, hardly anyone realizes Him. ||1||
O Beloved, Your state is inaccessible and infinite.
You save even the worst sinners.
He is the Purifier of sinners, the Lover of His devotees, the Ocean of mercy, our Lord and Master.

Please take hold of my arm and bless me with Your Name. I am honored only by Your Grace.

Meeting with Him, I am embellished and exalted; gazing on Him, I am fascinated, and I realize my pre-ordained destiny.
Prays Nanak, I seek the Sanctuary of those who meditate on the Lord, Har, Har. ||4||1||
