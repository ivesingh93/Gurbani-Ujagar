The Gurmukh puts out the four fires, with the Water of the Lord's Name.
The lotus blossoms deep within the heart, and filled with Ambrosial Nectar, one is satisfied.
O Nanak, make the True Guru your friend; going to His Court, you shall obtain the True Lord. ||4||20||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
Meditate on the Lord, Har, Har, O my beloved; follow the Guru's Teachings, and speak of the Lord.
Apply the Touchstone of Truth to your mind, and see if it comes up to its full weight.
No one has found the worth of the ruby of the heart; its value cannot be estimated. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, the Diamond of the Lord is within the Guru.
The True Guru is found in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. Day and night, praise the Word of His Shabad. ||1||Pause||
The True Merchandise, Wealth and Capital are obtained through the Radiant Light of the Guru.
Just as fire is extinguished by pouring on water, desire becomes the slave of the Lord's slaves.
The Messenger of Death will not touch you; in this way, you shall cross over the terrifying world-ocean, carrying others across with you. ||2||
The Gurmukhs do not like falsehood. They are imbued with Truth; they love only Truth.
The shaaktas, the faithless cynics, do not like the Truth; false are the foundations of the false.
Imbued with Truth, you shall meet the Guru. The true ones are absorbed into the True Lord. ||3||
Within the mind are emeralds and rubies, the Jewel of the Naam, treasures and diamonds.
The Naam is the True Merchandise and Wealth; in each and every heart, His Presence is deep and profound.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh finds the Diamond of the Lord, by His Kindness and Compassion. ||4||21||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
The fire of doubt is not extinguished, even by wandering through foreign lands and countries.
If inner filth is not removed, one's life is cursed, and one's clothes are cursed.
There is no other way to perform devotional worship, except through the Teachings of the True Guru. ||1||
O mind, become Gurmukh, and extinguish the fire within.
Let the Words of the Guru abide within your mind; let egotism and desires die. ||1||Pause||
The jewel of the mind is priceless; through the Name of the Lord, honor is obtained.
Join the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, and find the Lord. The Gurmukh embraces love for the Lord.
Give up your selfishness, and you shall find peace; like water mingling with water, you shall merge in absorption. ||2||
Those who have not contemplated the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, are unworthy; they come and go in reincarnation.
One who has not met with the True Guru, the Primal Being, is bothered and bewildered in the terrifying world-ocean.
This jewel of the soul is priceless, and yet it is being squandered like this, in exchange for a mere shell. ||3||
Those who joyfully meet with the True Guru are perfectly fulfilled and wise.
Meeting with the Guru, they cross over the terrifying world-ocean. In the Court of the Lord, they are honored and approved.
O Nanak, their faces are radiant; the Music of the Shabad, the Word of God, wells up within them. ||4||22||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
Make your deals, dealers, and take care of your merchandise.
Buy that object which will go along with you.
In the next world, the All-knowing Merchant will take this object and care for it. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, chant the Lord's Name, and focus your consciousness on Him.
Take the Merchandise of the Lord's Praises with you. Your Husband Lord shall see this and approve. ||1||Pause||
