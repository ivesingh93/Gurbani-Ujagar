In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, meditate and vibrate upon your imperishable Lord and Master, and you shall be honored in the Court of the Lord. ||3||
The four great blessings, and the eighteen miraculous spiritual powers,
are found in the treasure of the Naam, which brings celestial peace and poise, and the nine treasures.
If you yearn in your mind for all joys, then join the Saadh Sangat, and dwell upon your Lord and Master. ||4||
The Shaastras, the Simritees and the Vedas proclaim
that the mortal must be victorious in this priceless human life.
Forsaking sexual desire, anger and slander, sing of the Lord with your tongue, O Nanak. ||5||
He has no form or shape, no ancestry or social class.
The Perfect Lord is perfectly pervading day and night.
Whoever meditates on Him is very fortunate; he is not consigned to reincarnation again. ||6||
One who forgets the Primal Lord, the Architect of karma,
wanders around burning, and remains tormented.
No one can save such an ungrateful person; he is thrown into the most horrible hell. ||7||
He blessed you with your soul, the breath of life, your body and wealth;
He preserved and nurtured you in your mother's womb.
Forsaking His Love, you are imbued with another; you shall never achieve your goals like this. ||8||
Please shower me with Your Merciful Grace, O my Lord and Master.
You dwell in each and every heart, and are near everyone.
Nothing is in my hands; he alone knows, whom You inspire to know. ||9||
One who has such pre-ordained destiny inscribed upon his forehead,
that person is not afflicted by Maya.
Slave Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary forever; there is no other equal to You. ||10||
In His Will, He made all pain and pleasure.
How rare are those who remember the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord.
His value cannot be described. He is prevailing everywhere. ||11||
He is the devotee; He is the Great Giver.
He is the Perfect Primal Lord, the Architect of karma.
He is your help and support, since infancy; He fulfills your mind's desires. ||12||
Death, pain and pleasure are ordained by the Lord.
They do not increase or decrease by anyone's efforts.
That alone happens, which is pleasing to the Creator; speaking of himself, the mortal ruins himself. ||13||
He lifts us up and pulls us out of the deep dark pit;
He unites with Himself, those who were separated for so many incarnations.
Showering them with His Mercy, He protects them with His own hands. Meeting with the Holy Saints, they meditate on the Lord of the Universe. ||14||
Your worth cannot be described.
Wondrous is Your form, and Your glorious greatness.
Your humble servant begs for the gift of devotional worship. Nanak is a sacrifice, a sacrifice to You. ||15||1||14||22||24||2||14||62||
