Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
The Life of the World, the Sustainer of the Earth, has showered His Mercy;
the Guru's Feet have come to dwell within my mind.
The Creator has made me His Own. He has destroyed the city of sorrow. ||1||
The True One abides within my mind and body;
no place seems difficult to me now.
All the evil-doers and enemies have now become my friends. I long only for my Lord and Master. ||2||
Whatever He does, He does all by Himself.
No one can know His Ways.
He Himself is the Helper and Support of His Saints. God has cast out my doubts and delusions. ||3||
His Lotus Feet are the Support of His humble servants.
Twenty-four hours a day, they deal in the Name of the Lord.
In peace and pleasure, they sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe. O Nanak, God is permeating everywhere. ||4||36||43||
Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
True is that temple, within which one meditates on the True Lord.
Blessed is that heart, within which the Lord's Glorious Praises are sung.
Beautiful is that land, where the Lord's humble servants dwell. I am a sacrifice to the True Name. ||1||
The extent of the True Lord's Greatness cannot be known.
His Creative Power and His Bounties cannot be described.
Your humble servants live by meditating, meditating on You. Their minds treasure the True Word of the Shabad. ||2||
The Praises of the True One are obtained by great good fortune.
By Guru's Grace, the Glorious Praises of the Lord are sung.
Those who are imbued with Your Love are pleasing to You. The True Name is their Banner and Insignia. ||3||
No one knows the limits of the True Lord.
In all places and interspaces, the True One is pervading.
O Nanak, meditate forever on the True One, the Searcher of hearts, the Knower of all. ||4||37||44||
Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
Beautiful is the night, and beautiful is the day,
when one joins the Society of the Saints and chants the Ambrosial Naam.
If you remember the Lord in meditation for a moment, even for an instant, then your life will become fruitful and prosperous. ||1||
Remembering the Naam, the Name of the Lord, all sinful mistakes are erased.
Inwardly and outwardly, the Lord God is always with us.
Fear, dread and doubt have been dispelled by the Perfect Guru; now, I see God everywhere. ||2||
God is All-powerful, Vast, Lofty and Infinite.
The Naam is overflowing with the nine treasures.
In the beginning, in the middle, and in the end, there is God. Nothing else even comes close to Him. ||3||
Take pity on me, O my Lord, Merciful to the meek.
I am a beggar, begging for the dust of the feet of the Holy.
Servant Nanak begs for this gift: let me meditate on the Lord, forever and ever. ||4||38||45||
Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
You are here, and You are hereafter.
All beings and creatures were created by You.
Without You, there is no other, O Creator. You are my Support and my Protection. ||1||
The tongue lives by chanting and meditating on the Lord's Name.
The Supreme Lord God is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.
Those who serve the Lord find peace; they do not lose their lives in the gamble. ||2||
Your humble servant, who obtains the Medicine of the Naam,
