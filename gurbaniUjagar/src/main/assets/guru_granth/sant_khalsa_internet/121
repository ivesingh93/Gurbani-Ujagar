O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Naam, reflect deeply on the Truth; they practice only Truth. ||8||18||19||
Maajh, Third Mehl:
The Word of the Shabad is Immaculate and Pure; the Bani of the Word is Pure.
The Light which is pervading among all is Immaculate.
So praise the Immaculate Word of the Lord's Bani; chanting the Immaculate Name of the Lord, all filth is washed away. ||1||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who enshrine the Giver of peace within their minds.
Praise the Immaculate Lord, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad. Listen to the Shabad, and quench your thirst. ||1||Pause||
When the Immaculate Naam comes to dwell in the mind,
the mind and body become Immaculate, and emotional attachment to Maya departs.
Sing the Glorious Praises of the Immaculate True Lord forever, and the Immaculate Sound-current of the Naad shall vibrate within. ||2||
The Immaculate Ambrosial Nectar is obtained from the Guru.
When selfishness and conceit are eradicated from within, then there is no attachment to Maya.
Immaculate is the spiritual wisdom, and utterly immaculate is the meditation, of those whose minds are filled with the Immaculate Bani of the Word. ||3||
One who serves the Immaculate Lord becomes immaculate.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the filth of egotism is washed away.
The Immaculate Bani and the Unstruck Melody of the Sound-current vibrate, and in the True Court, honor is obtained. ||4||
Through the Immaculate Lord, all become immaculate.
Immaculate is the mind which weaves the Word of the Lord's Shabad into itself.
Blessed and very fortunate are those who are committed to the Immaculate Name; through the Immaculate Name, they are blessed and beautified. ||5||
Immaculate is the one who is adorned with the Shabad.
The Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord, entices the mind and body.
No filth ever attaches itself to the True Name; one's face is made radiant by the True One. ||6||
The mind is polluted by the love of duality.
Filthy is that kitchen, and filthy is that dwelling;
eating filth, the self-willed manmukhs become even more filthy. Because of their filth, they suffer in pain. ||7||
The filthy, and the immaculate as well, are all subject to the Hukam of God's Command.
They alone are immaculate, who are pleasing to the True Lord.
O Nanak, the Naam abides deep within the minds of the Gurmukhs, who are cleansed of all their filth. ||8||19||20||
Maajh, Third Mehl:
The Lord of the Universe is radiant, and radiant are His soul-swans.
Their minds and their speech are immaculate; they are my hope and ideal.
Their minds are radiant, and their faces are always beautiful; they meditate on the most radiant Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe.
So chant Gobind, Gobind, the Lord of the Universe, day and night; sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord Gobind, through the Word of His Shabad. ||1||Pause||
Sing of the Lord Gobind with intuitive ease,
in the Fear of the Guru; you shall become radiant, and the filth of egotism shall depart.
Remain in bliss forever, and perform devotional worship, day and night. Hear and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord Gobind. ||2||
Channel your dancing mind in devotional worship,
and through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, merge your mind with the Supreme Mind.
Let your true and perfect tune be the subjugation of your love of Maya, and let yourself dance to the Shabad. ||3||
People shout out loud and move their bodies,
but if they are emotionally attached to Maya, then the Messenger of Death shall hunt them down.
