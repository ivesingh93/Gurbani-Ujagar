Please shower me with Your Mercy, O Lord God!
I have given up my excessive cleverness and scheming,
and I have taken the support of the Saints as my mind's support.
Even a puppet of ashes attains the supreme status,
O Nanak, if it has the help and support of the Saints. ||23||
Shalok:
Practicing oppression and tyranny, he puffs himself up; he acts in corruption with his frail, perishable body.
He is bound by his egotistical intellect; O Nanak, salvation comes only through the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||
Pauree:
JAJJA: When someone, in his ego, believes that he has become something,
he is caught in his error, like a parrot in a trap.
When he believes, in his ego, that he is a devotee and a spiritual teacher,
then, in the world hereafter, the Lord of the Universe shall have no regard for him at all.
When he believes himself to be a preacher,
he is merely a peddler wandering over the earth.
But one who conquers his ego in the Company of the Holy,
O Nanak, meets the Lord. ||24||
Shalok:
Rise early in the morning, and chant the Naam; worship and adore the Lord, night and day.
Anxiety shall not afflict you, O Nanak, and your misfortune shall vanish. ||1||
Pauree:
JHAJHA: Your sorrows shall depart,
when you deal with the Lord's Name.
The faithless cynic dies in sorrow and pain;
his heart is filled with the love of duality.
Your evil deeds and sins shall fall away, O my mind,
listening to the ambrosial speech in the Society of the Saints.
Sexual desire, anger and wickedness fall away,
O Nanak, from those who are blessed by the Mercy of the Lord of the World. ||25||
Shalok:
You can try all sorts of things, but you still cannot remain here, my friend.
But you shall live forevermore, O Nanak, if you vibrate and love the Naam, the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||
Pauree:
NYANYA: Know this as absolutely correct, that that this ordinary love shall come to an end.
You may count and calculate as much as you want, but you cannot count how many have arisen and departed.
Whoever I see shall perish. With whom should I associate?
Know this as true in your consciousness, that the love of Maya is false.
He alone knows, and he alone is a Saint, who is free of doubt.
He is lifted up and out of the deep dark pit; the Lord is totally pleased with him.
God's Hand is All-powerful; He is the Creator, the Cause of causes.
O Nanak, praise the One, who joins us to Himself. ||26||
Shalok:
The bondage of birth and death is broken and peace is obtained, by serving the Holy.
O Nanak, may I never forget from my mind, the Treasure of Virtue, the Sovereign Lord of the Universe. ||1||
Pauree:
Work for the One Lord; no one returns empty-handed from Him.
When the Lord abides within your mind, body, mouth and heart, then whatever you desire shall come to pass.
He alone obtains the Lord's service, and the Mansion of His Presence, unto whom the Holy Saint is compassionate.
He joins the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, only when the Lord Himself shows His Mercy.
I have searched and searched, across so many worlds, but without the Name, there is no peace.
The Messenger of Death retreats from those who dwell in the Saadh Sangat.
Again and again, I am forever devoted to the Saints.
O Nanak, my sins from so long ago have been erased. ||27||
Shalok:
Those beings, with whom the Lord is thoroughly pleased, meet with no obstacles at His Door.
Those humble beings whom God has made His own, O Nanak, are blessed, so very blessed. ||1||
