their minds are turned towards the Lord in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
O servant Nanak, their Beloved Lord seems so sweet to them. ||2||1||23||
Malaar, Fifth Mehl:
My mind wanders through the dense forest.
It walks with eagerness and love,
hoping to meet God. ||1||Pause||
Maya with her three gunas - the three dispositions - has come to entice me; whom can I tell of my pain? ||1||
I tried everything else, but nothing could rid me of my sorrow.
So hurry to the Sanctuary of the Holy, O Nanak; joining them, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe. ||2||2||24||
Malaar, Fifth Mehl:
The glory of my Beloved is noble and sublime.
The celestial singers and angels sing His Sublime Praises in ecstasy, happiness and joy. ||1||Pause||
The most worthy beings sing God's Praises in beautiful harmonies, in all sorts of ways, in myriads of sublime forms. ||1||
Throughout the mountains, trees, deserts, oceans and galaxies, permeating each and every heart, the sublime grandeur of my Love is totally pervading.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the Love of the Lord is found; O Nanak, sublime is that faith. ||2||3||25||
Malaar, Fifth Mehl:
With love for the Guru, I enshrine the Lotus Feet of my Lord deep within my heart. ||1||Pause||
I gaze on the Blessed Vision of His Fruitful Darshan; my sins are erased and taken away.
My mind is immaculate and enlightened. ||1||
I am wonderstruck, stunned and amazed.
Chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, millions of sins are destroyed.
I fall at His Feet, and touch my forehead to them.
You alone are, You alone are, O God.
Your devotees take Your Support.
Servant Nanak has come to the Door of Your Sanctuary. ||2||4||26||
Malaar, Fifth Mehl:
Rain down with happiness in God's Will.
Bless me with total bliss and good fortune. ||1||Pause||
My mind blossoms forth in the Society of the Saints; soaking up the rain, the earth is blessed and beautified. ||1||
The peacock loves the thunder of the rain clouds.
The rainbird's mind is drawn to the rain-drop
NAME?
I have renounced Maya, the deceiver.
Joining with the Saints, Nanak is awakened. ||2||5||27||
Malaar, Fifth Mehl:
Sing forever the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the World.
Enshrine the Lord's Name in your consciousness. ||1||Pause||
Forsake your pride, and abandon your ego; join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
Meditate in loving remembrance on the One Lord; your sorrows shall be ended, O friend. ||1||
The Supreme Lord God has become merciful;
corrupt entanglements have come to an end.
Grasping the feet of the Holy,
Nanak sings forever the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the World. ||2||6||28||
Malaar, Fifth Mehl:
The Embodiment of the Lord of the Universe roars like the thunder-cloud.
Singing His Glorious Praises brings peace and bliss. ||1||Pause||
The Sanctuary of the Lord's Feet carries us across the world-ocean. His Sublime Word is the unstruck celestial melody. ||1||
The thirsty traveler's consciousness obtains the water of the soul from the pool of nectar.
Servant Nanak loves the Blessed Vision of the Lord; in His Mercy, God has blessed him with it. ||2||7||29||
