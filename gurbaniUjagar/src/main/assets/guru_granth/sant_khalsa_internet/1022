The Ganges, the Jamunaa where Krishna played, Kaydar Naat'h,
Benares, Kanchivaram, Puri, Dwaarkaa,
Ganga Saagar where the Ganges empties into the ocean, Trivaynee where the three rivers come together, and the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage, are all merged in the Lord's Being. ||9||
He Himself is the Siddha, the seeker, in meditative contemplation.
He Himself is the King and the Council.
God Himself, the wise Judge, sits on the throne; He takes away doubt, duality and fear. ||10||
He Himself is the Qazi; He Himself is the Mullah.
He Himself is infallible; He never makes mistakes.
He Himself is the Giver of Grace, compassion and honor; He is no one's enemy. ||11||
Whoever He forgives, He blesses with glorious greatness.
He is the Giver of all; He does not have even an iota of greed.
The Immaculate Lord is all pervading, permeating everywhere, both hidden and manifest. ||12||
How can I praise the inaccessible, infinite Lord?
The True Creator Lord is the Enemy of ego.
He unites those whom He blesses with His Grace; uniting them in His Union, they are united. ||13||
Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva stand at His Door;
they serve the unseen, infinite Lord.
Millions of others can be seen crying at His door; I cannot even estimate their numbers. ||14||
True is the Kirtan of His Praise, and True is the Word of His Bani.
I can see no other in the Vedas and the Puraanas.
Truth is my capital; I sing the Glorious Praises of the True Lord. I have no other support at all. ||15||
In each and every age, the True Lord is, and shall always be.
Who has not died? Who shall not die?
Nanak the lowly offers this prayer; see Him within your own self, and lovingly focus on the Lord. ||16||2||
Maaroo, First Mehl:
In duality and evil-mindedness, the soul-bride is blind and deaf.
She wears the dress of sexual desire and anger.
Her Husband Lord is within the home of her own heart, but she does not know Him; without her Husband Lord, she cannot go to sleep. ||1||
The great fire of desire blazes within her.
The self-willed manmukh looks around in the four directions.
Without serving the True Guru, how can she find peace? Glorious greatness rests in the hands of the True Lord. ||2||
Eradicating sexual desire, anger and egotism,
she destroys the five thieves through the Word of the Shabad.
Taking up the sword of spiritual wisdom, she struggles with her mind, and hope and desire are smoothed over in her mind. ||3||
From the union of the mother's egg and the father's sperm,
the form of infinite beauty has been created.
The blessings of light all come from You; You are the Creator Lord, pervading everywhere. ||4||
You have created birth and death.
Why should anyone fear, if they come to understand through the Guru?
When You, O Merciful Lord, look with Your kindness, then pain and suffering leave the body. ||5||
One who sits in the home of his own self, eats his own fears.
He quiets and holds his wandering mind still.
His heart-lotus blossoms forth in the overflowing green pool, and the Lord of his soul becomes his companion and helper. ||6||
With their death already ordained, mortals come into this world.
How can they remain here? They have to go to the world beyond.
True is the Lord's Command; the true ones dwell in the eternal city. The True Lord blesses them with glorious greatness. ||7||
He Himself created the whole world.
The One who made it, assigns the tasks to it.
