So speaks NALL the poet: touching the Philosopher's Stone, glass is transformed into gold, and the sandalwood tree imparts its fragrance to other trees; meditating in remembrance on the Lord, I am transformed.
Seeing His Door, I am rid of sexual desire and anger. I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, to the True Name, O my True Guru. ||3||

Radd:
He established the earth, the sky and the air, the water of the oceans, fire and food.

One who has the Guru on his side - how could he be proud of his wealth?
One who has the Guru on his side - what would hundreds of thousands of supporters do for him?
One who has the Guru on his side, does not depend on anyone else for spiritual wisdom and meditation.
One who has the Guru on his side contemplates the Shabad and the Teachings, and abides in the Home of Truth.
The Lord's humble slave and poet utters this prayer: whoever chants to the Guru night and day,
whoever enshrines the Name of the Guru within his heart, is rid of both birth and death. ||3||7||
Without the Guru, there is utter darkness; without the Guru, understanding does not come.
Without the Guru, there is no intuitive awareness or success; without the Guru, there is no liberation.
So make Him your Guru, and contemplate the Truth; make Him your Guru, O my mind.
Make Him your Guru, who is embellished and exalted in the Word of the Shabad; all your sins shall be washed away.
So speaks NALL the poet: with your eyes, make Him your Guru; with the words you speak, make Him your Guru, your True Guru.
Those who have not seen the Guru, who have not made Him their Guru, are useless in this world. ||4||8||
Dwell upon the Guru, the Guru, the Guru, O my mind.
