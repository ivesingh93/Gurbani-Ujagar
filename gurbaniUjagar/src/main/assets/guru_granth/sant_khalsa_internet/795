Raag Bilaaval, First Mehl, Chau-Padas, First House:
You are the Emperor, and I call You a chief - how does this add to Your greatness?
As You permit me, I praise You, O Lord and Master; I am ignorant, and I cannot chant Your Praises. ||1||
Please bless me with such understanding, that I may sing Your Glorious Praises.
May I dwell in Truth, according to Your Will. ||1||Pause||
Whatever has happened, has all come from You. You are All-knowing.
Your limits cannot be known, O my Lord and Master; I am blind - what wisdom do I have? ||2||
What should I say? While talking, I talk of seeing, but I cannot describe the indescribable.
As it pleases Your Will, I speak; it is just the tiniest bit of Your greatness. ||3||
Among so many dogs, I am an outcast; I bark for my body's belly.
Without devotional worship, O Nanak, even so, still, my Master's Name does not leave me. ||4||1||
Bilaawal, First Mehl:
My mind is the temple, and my body is the simple cloth of the humble seeker; deep within my heart, I bathe at the sacred shrine.
The One Word of the Shabad abides within my mind; I shall not come to be born again. ||1||
My mind is pierced through by the Merciful Lord, O my mother!
Who can know the pain of another?
I think of none other than the Lord. ||1||Pause||
O Lord, inaccessible, unfathomable, invisible and infinite: please, take care of me!
In the water, on the land and in sky, You are totally pervading. Your Light is in each and every heart. ||2||
All teachings, instructions and understandings are Yours; the mansions and sanctuaries are Yours as well.
Without You, I know no other, O my Lord and Master; I continually sing Your Glorious Praises. ||3||
All beings and creatures seek the Protection of Your Sanctuary; all thought of their care rests with You.
That which pleases Your Will is good; this alone is Nanak's prayer. ||4||2||
Bilaawal, First Mehl:
He Himself is the Word of the Shabad, and He Himself is the Insignia.
He Himself is the Listener, and He Himself is the Knower.
He Himself created the creation, and He Himself beholds His almighty power.
You are the Great Giver; Your Name alone is approved. ||1||
