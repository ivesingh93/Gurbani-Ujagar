Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
Arising each day, you cherish your body, but you are idiotic, ignorant and without understanding.
You are not conscious of God, and your body shall be cast into the wilderness.
Focus your consciousness on the True Guru; you shall enjoy bliss forever and ever. ||1||
O mortal, you came here to earn a profit.
What useless activities are you attached to? Your life-night is coming to its end. ||1||Pause||
The animals and the birds frolic and play-they do not see death.
Mankind is also with them, trapped in the net of Maya.
Those who always remember the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are considered to be liberated. ||2||
That dwelling which you will have to abandon and vacate-you are attached to it in your mind.
And that place where you must go to dwell-you have no regard for it at all.
Those who fall at the Feet of the Guru are released from this bondage. ||3||
No one else can save you-don't look for anyone else.
I have searched in all four directions; I have come to find His Sanctuary.
O Nanak, the True King has pulled me out and saved me from drowning! ||4||3||73||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
For a brief moment, man is a guest of the Lord; he tries to resolve his affairs.
Engrossed in Maya and sexual desire, the fool does not understand.
He arises and departs with regret, and falls into the clutches of the Messenger of Death. ||1||
You are sitting on the collapsing riverbank-are you blind?
If you are so pre-destined, then act according to the Guru's Teachings. ||1||Pause||
The Reaper does not look upon any as unripe, half-ripe or fully ripe.
Picking up and wielding their sickles, the harvesters arrive.
When the landlord gives the order, they cut and measure the crop. ||2||
The first watch of the night passes away in worthless affairs, and the second passes in deep sleep.
In the third, they babble nonsense, and when the fourth watch comes, the day of death has arrived.
The thought of the One who bestows body and soul never enters the mind. ||3||
I am devoted to the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; I sacrifice my soul to them.
Through them, understanding has entered my mind, and I have met the All-knowing Lord God.
Nanak sees the Lord always with him-the Lord, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. ||4||4||74||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
Let me forget everything, but let me not forget the One Lord.
All my evil pursuits have been burnt away; the Guru has blessed me with the Naam, the true object of life.
Give up all other hopes, and rely on the One Hope.
Those who serve the True Guru receive a place in the world hereafter. ||1||
O my mind, praise the Creator.
Give up all your clever tricks, and fall at the Feet of the Guru. ||1||Pause||
Pain and hunger shall not oppress you, if the Giver of Peace comes into your mind.
No undertaking shall fail, when the True Lord is always in your heart.
No one can kill that one unto whom You, Lord, give Your Hand and protect.
Serve the Guru, the Giver of Peace; He shall remove and wash off all your faults. ||2||
Your servant begs to serve those who are enjoined to Your service.
