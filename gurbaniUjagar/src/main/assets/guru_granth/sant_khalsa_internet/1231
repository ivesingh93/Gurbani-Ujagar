Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
You are my Loving Beloved Enticing Lord of the World.
You are in worms, elephants, stones and all beings and creatures; You nourish and cherish them all. ||1||Pause||
You are not far away; You are totally present with all.
You are Beautiful, the Source of Nectar. ||1||
You have no caste or social class, no ancestry or family.
Nanak: God, You are Merciful. ||2||9||138||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Acting and play-acting, the mortal sinks into corruption. Even the moon and the sun are enticed and bewitched.
The disturbing noise of corruption wells up, in the tinkling ankle bells of Maya the beautiful. With her beguiling gestures of love, she seduces everyone except the Lord. ||Pause
Maya clings to the three worlds; those who are stuck in wrong actions cannot escape her. Drunk and engrossed in blind worldly affairs, they are tossed about on the mighty ocean. ||1||
The Saint, the slave of the Lord is saved; the noose of the Messenger of Death is snapped. The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the Purifier of sinners; O Nanak, remember Him in meditation. ||2||10||139||3||13||155||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Raag Saarang, Ninth Mehl:
No one will be your help and support, except the Lord.
Who has any mother, father, child or spouse? Who is anyone's brother or sister? ||1||Pause||
All the wealth, land and property which you consider your own
- when you leave your body, none of it shall go along with you. Why do you cling to them? ||1||
God is Merciful to the meek, forever the Destroyer of fear, and yet you do not develop any loving relationship with Him.
Says Nanak, the whole world is totally false; it is like a dream in the night. ||2||1||
Saarang, Ninth Mehl:
O mortal, why are you engrossed in corruption?
No one is allowed to remain in this world; one comes, and another departs. ||1||Pause||
Who has a body? Who has wealth and property? With whom should we fall in love?
Whatever is seen, shall all disappear, like the shade of a passing cloud. ||1||
Abandon egotism, and grasp the Sanctuary of the Saints; you shall be liberated in an instant.
O servant Nanak, without meditating and vibrating on the Lord God, there is no peace, even in dreams. ||2||2||
Saarang, Ninth Mehl:
O mortal, why have you wasted your life?
Intoxicated with Maya and its riches, involved in corrupt pleasures, you have not sought the Sanctuary of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
This whole world is just a dream; why does seeing it fill you with greed?
Everything that has been created will be destroyed; nothing will remain. ||1||
You see this false body as true; in this way, you have placed yourself in bondage.
O servant Nanak, he is a liberated being, whose consciousness lovingly vibrates, and meditates on the Lord. ||2||3||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
In my mind, I never sang the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
