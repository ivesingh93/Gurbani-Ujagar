before I came into the womb this time. ||1||Pause||
I was a Yogi, a celibate, a penitent, and a Brahmchaaree, with strict self-discipline.
Sometimes I was a king, sitting on the throne, and sometimes I was a beggar. ||2||
The faithless cynics shall die, while the Saints shall all survive.
They drink in the Lord's Ambrosial Essence with their tongues. ||3||
Says Kabeer, O God, have mercy on me.
I am so tired; now, please bless me with Your perfection. ||4||13||
Gauree, Kabeer Jee, With Writings Of The Fifth Mehl:
Kabeer has seen such wonders!
Mistaking it for cream, the people are churning water. ||1||Pause||
The donkey grazes upon the green grass;
arising each day, he laughs and brays, and then dies. ||1||
The bull is intoxicated, and runs around wildly.
He romps and eats and then falls into hell. ||2||
Says Kabeer, a strange sport has become manifest:
the sheep is sucking the milk of her lamb. ||3||
Chanting the Lord's Name, my intellect is enlightened.
Says Kabeer, the Guru has blessed me with this understanding. ||4||1||14||
Gauree, Kabeer Jee, Panch-Padas:
I am like a fish out of water,
because in my previous life, I did not practice penance and intense meditation. ||1||
Now tell me, Lord, what will my condition be?
I left Benares - I had little common sense. ||1||Pause||
I wasted my whole life in the city of Shiva;
at the time of my death, I moved to Magahar. ||2||
For many years, I practiced penance and intense meditation at Kaashi;
now that my time to dIE has come, I have come to dwell at Magahar! ||3||
Kaashi and Magahar - I consider them the same.
With inadequate devotion, how can anyone swim across? ||4||
Says Kabeer, the Guru and Ganaysha and Shiva all know
that Kabeer died chanting the Lord's Name. ||5||15||
Gauree, Kabeer Jee:
You may anoint your limbs with sandalwood oil,
but in the end, that body will be burned with the firewood. ||1||
Why should anyone take pride in this body or wealth?
They shall end up lying on the ground; they shall not go along with you to the world beyond. ||1||Pause||
They sleep by night and work during the day,
but they do not chant the Lord's Name, even for an instant. ||2||
They hold the string of the kite in their hands, and chew betel leaves in their mouths,
but at the time of death, they shall be tied up tight, like thieves. ||3||
Through the Guru's Teachings, and immersed in His Love, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
Chant the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam, and find peace. ||4||
In His Mercy, He implants the Naam within us;
inhale deeply the sweet aroma and fragrance of the Lord, Har, Har. ||5||
Says Kabeer, remember Him, you blind fool!
The Lord is True; all worldly affairs are false. ||6||16||
Gauree, Kabeer Jee, Ti-Padas And Chau-Tukas:
I have turned away from death and turned to the Lord.
Pain has been eliminated, and I dwell in peac and comfort.
My enemies have been transformed into friends.
The faithless cynics have been transformed into good-hearted people. ||1||
Now, I feel that everything brings me peace.
Peace and tranquility have come, since I realized the Lord of the Universe. ||1||Pause||
My body was afflicted with millions of diseases.
