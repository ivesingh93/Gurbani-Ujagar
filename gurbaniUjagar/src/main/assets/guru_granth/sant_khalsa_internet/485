One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Aasaa, The Word Of The Reverend Naam Dayv Jee:
In the one and in the many, He is pervading and permeating; wherever I look, there He is.
The marvelous image of Maya is so fascinating; how few understand this. ||1||
God is everything, God is everything. Without God, there is nothing at all.
As one thread holds hundreds and thousands of beads, He is woven into His creation. ||1||Pause||
The waves of the water, the foam and bubbles, are not distinct from the water.
This manifested world is the playful game of the Supreme Lord God; reflecting upon it, we find that it is not different from Him. ||2||
False doubts and dream objects - man believes them to be true.
The Guru has instructed me to try to do good deeds, and my awakened mind has accepted this. ||3||
Says Naam Dayv, see the Creation of the Lord, and reflect upon it in your heart.
In each and every heart, and deep within the very nucleus of all, is the One Lord. ||4||1||
Aasaa:
Bringing the pitcher, I fill it with water, to bathe the Lord.
But 4.2 million species of beings are in the water - how can I use it for the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny? ||1||
Wherever I go, the Lord is there.
He continually plays in supreme bliss. ||1||Pause||
I bring flowers to weave a garland, in worshipful adoration of the Lord.
But the bumble bee has already sucked out the fragrance - how can I use it for the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny? ||2||
I carry milk and cook it to make pudding, with which to feed the Lord.
But the calf has already tasted the milk - how can I use it for the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny? ||3||
The Lord is here, the Lord is there; without the Lord, there is no world at all.
Prays Naam Dayv, O Lord, You are totally permeating and pervading all places and interspaces. ||4||2||
Aasaa:
My mind is the yardstick, and my tongue is the scissors.
I measure it out and cut off the noose of death. ||1||
What do I have to do with social status? What do I have to with ancestry?
I meditate on the Name of the Lord, day and night. ||1||Pause||
I dye myself in the color of the Lord, and sew what has to be sewn.
Without the Lord's Name, I cannot live, even for a moment. ||2||
I perform devotional worship, and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
Twenty-four hours a day, I meditate on my Lord and Master. ||3||
My needle is gold, and my thread is silver.
Naam Dayv's mind is attached to the Lord. ||4||3||
Aasaa:
The snake sheds its skin, but does not lose its venom.
The heron appears to be meditating, but it is concentrating on the water. ||1||
Why do you practice meditation and chanting,
when your mind is not pure? ||1||Pause||
That man who feeds like a lion,
is called the god of thieves. ||2||
Naam Dayv's Lord and Master has settled my inner conflicts.
