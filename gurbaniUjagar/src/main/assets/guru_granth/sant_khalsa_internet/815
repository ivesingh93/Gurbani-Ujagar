Nanak has been blessed with God's Mercy; God has made him His Slave. ||4||25||55||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
The Lord is the Hope and Support of His devotees; there is nowhere else for them to go.
O God, Your Name is my power, realm, relatives and riches. ||1||
God has granted His Mercy, and saved His slaves.
The slanderers rot in their slander; they are seized by the Messenger of Death. ||1||Pause||
The Saints meditate on the One Lord, and no other.
They offer their prayers to the One Lord, who is pervading and permeating all places. ||2||
I have heard this old story, spoken by the devotees,
that all the wicked are cut apart into pieces, while His humble servants are blessed with honor. ||3||
Nanak speaks the true words, which are obvious to all.
God's servants are under God's Protection; they have absolutely no fear. ||4||26||56||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
God breaks the bonds which hold us; He holds all power in His hands.
No other actions will bring release; save me, O my Lord and Master. ||1||
I have entered Your Sanctuary, O Perfect Lord of Mercy.
Those whom You preserve and protect, O Lord of the Universe, are saved from the trap of the world. ||1||Pause||
Hope, doubt, corruption and emotional attachment - in these, he is engrossed.
The false material world abides in his mind, and he does not understand the Supreme Lord God. ||2||
O Perfect Lord of Supreme Light, all beings belong to You.
As You keep us, we live, O infinite, inaccessible God. ||3||
Cause of causes, All-powerful Lord God, please bless me with Your Name.
Nanak is carried across in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, Har, Har. ||4||27||57||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Who? Who has not fallen, by placing their hopes in you?
You are enticed by the great enticer - this is the way to hell! ||1||
O vicious mind, no faith can be placed in you; you are totally intoxicated.
The donkey's leash is only removed, after the load is placed on his back. ||1||Pause||
You destroy the value of chanting, intensive meditation and self-discipline; you shall suffer in pain, beaten by the Messenger of Death.
You do not meditate, so you shall suffer the pains of reincarnation, you shameless buffoon! ||2||
The Lord is your Companion, your Helper, your Best Friend; but you disagree with Him.
You are in love with the five thieves; this brings terrible pain. ||3||
Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Saints, who have conquered their minds.
He gives body, wealth and everything to the slaves of God. ||4||28||58||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Try to meditate, and contemplate the source of peace, and bliss will come to you.
Chanting, and meditating on the Name of the Lord of the Universe, perfect understanding is achieved. ||1||
Meditating on the Lotus Feet of the Guru, and chanting the Name of the Lord, I live.
Worshipping the Supreme Lord God in adoration, my mouth drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar. ||1||Pause||
All beings and creatures dwell in peace; the minds of all yearn for the Lord.
Those who continually remember the Lord, do good deeds for others; they harbor no ill will towards anyone. ||2||
