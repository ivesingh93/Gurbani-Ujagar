Through the Naam, the fire of desire is extinguished; the Naam is obtained by His Will. ||1||Pause||
In the Dark Age of Kali Yuga, realize the Word of the Shabad.
By this devotional worship, egotism is eliminated.
Serving the True Guru, one becomes approved.
So know the One, who created hope and desire. ||2||
What shall we offer to one who proclaims the Word of the Shabad?
By His Grace, the Naam is enshrined within our minds.
Offer your head, and shed your self-conceit.
One who understands the Lord's Command finds lasting peace. ||3||
He Himself does, and causes others to do.
He Himself enshrines His Name in the mind of the Gurmukh.
He Himself misleads us, and He Himself puts us back on the Path.
Through the True Word of the Shabad, we merge into the True Lord. ||4||
True is the Shabad, and True is the Word of the Lord's Bani.
In each and every age, the Gurmukhs speak it and chant it.
The self-willed manmukhs are deluded by doubt and attachment.
Without the Name, everyone wanders around insane. ||5||
Throughout the three worlds, is the one Maya.
The fool reads and reads, but holds tight to duality.
He performs all sorts of rituals, but still suffers terrible pain.
Serving the True Guru, eternal peace is obtained. ||6||
Reflective meditation upon the Shabad is such sweet nectar.
Night and day, one enjoys it, subduing his ego.
When the Lord showers His Mercy, we enjoy celestial bliss.
Imbued with the Naam, love the True Lord forever. ||7||
Meditate on the Lord, and read and reflect upon the Guru's Shabad.
Subdue your ego and meditate on the Lord.
Meditate on the Lord, and be imbued with fear and love of the True One.
O Nanak, enshrine the Naam within your heart, through the Guru's Teachings. ||8||3||25||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Raag Aasaa, Third Mehl, Ashtapadees, Eighth House, Kaafee:
Peace emanates from the Guru; He puts out the fire of desire.
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is obtained from the Guru; it is the greatest greatness. ||1||
Keep the One Name in your consciousness, O my Siblings of Destiny.

Spiritual wisdom emanates from the Guru; reflect upon the supreme essence of reality.
Through the Guru, the Lord's Mansion and His Court are attained; His devotional worship is overflowing with treasures. ||2||
The Gurmukh meditates on the Naam; he achieves reflective meditation and understanding.
The Gurmukh is the Lord's devotee, immersed in His Praises; the Infinite Word of the Shabad dwells within him. ||3||
Happiness emanates from the Gurmukh; he never suffers pain.
The Gurmukh conquers his ego, and his mind is immaculately pure. ||4||

A cooling and soothing peace comes within, and through the Naam, peace is obtained. ||6||
One meets the Perfect True Guru only when the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace.
All sins and vices are eradicated, and one shall never again suffer pain or distress. ||7||
