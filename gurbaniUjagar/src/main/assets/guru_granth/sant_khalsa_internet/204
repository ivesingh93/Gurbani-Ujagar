Raag Gauree Poorbee, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
By what virtues can I meet the Lord of life, O my mother? ||1||Pause||
I have no beauty, understanding or strength; I am a stranger, from far away. ||1||
I am not wealthy or youthful. I am an orphan - please, unite me with Yourself. ||2||
Searching and searching, I have become a renunciate, free of desire. I wander around, searching for the Blessed Vision of God's Darshan. ||3||
God is Compassionate, and Merciful to the meek; O Nanak, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the fire of desire has been quenched. ||4||1||118||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
The loving desire to meet my Beloved has arisen within my mind.
I touch His Feet, and offer my prayer to Him. If only I had the great good fortune to meet the Saint. ||1||Pause||
I surrender my mind to Him; I place my wealth before Him. I totally renounce my selfish ways.
One who teaches me the Sermon of the Lord God - night and day, I shall follow Him. ||1||
When the seed of the karma of past actions sprouted, I met the Lord; He is both the Enjoyer and the Renunciate.
My darkness was dispelled when I met the Lord. O Nanak, after being asleep for countless incarnations, I have awakened. ||2||2||119||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Come out, O soul-bird, and let the meditative remembrance of the Lord be your wings.
Meet the Holy Saint, take to His Sanctuary, and keep the perfect jewel of the Lord enshrined in your heart. ||1||Pause||
Superstition is the well, thirst for pleasure is the mud, and emotional attachment is the noose, so tight around your neck.
The only one who can cut this is the Guru of the World, the Lord of the Universe. So let yourself dwell at His Lotus Feet. ||1||
Bestow Your Mercy, O Lord of the Universe, O God, My Beloved, Master of the meek - please, listen to my prayer.
Take my hand, O Lord and Master of Nanak; my body and soul all belong to You. ||2||3||120||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
My mind yearns to behold the Lord in meditation.
I think of Him, I hope and thirst for Him, day and night; is there any Saint who may bring Him near me? ||1||Pause||
I serve the slaves of His slaves; in so many ways, I beg of Him.
Setting them upon the scale, I have weighed all comforts and pleasures; without the Lord's Blessed Vision, they are all totally inadequate. ||1||
By the Grace of the Saints, I sing the Praises of the Ocean of virtue; after countless incarnations, I have been released.
Meeting the Lord, Nanak has found peace and bliss; his life is redeemed, and prosperity dawns for him. ||2||4||121||

One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
How may I meet my Master, the King, the Lord of the Universe?
Is there any Saint, who can bestow such celestial peace, and show me the Way to Him? ||1||Pause||
