Such is the Name of the Immaculate, Divine Lord.
I am just a beggar; You are invisible and unknowable. ||1||Pause||
Love of Maya is like a cursed woman,
ugly, dirty and promiscuous.
Power and beauty are false, and last for only a few days.
But when one is blessed with the Naam, the darkness within is illuminated. ||2||
I tasted Maya and renounced it, and now, I have no doubts.
One whose father is known, cannot be illegitimate.
One who belongs to the One Lord, has no fear.
The Creator acts, and causes all to act. ||3||
One who dies in the Word of the Shabad conquers his mind, through his mind.
Keeping his mind restrained, he enshrines the True Lord within his heart.
He does not know any other, and he is a sacrifice to the Guru.
O Nanak, attuned to the Naam, he is emancipated. ||4||3||
Bilaaval, First Mehl:
Through the Word of the Guru's Teachings, the mind intuitively meditates on the Lord.
Imbued with the Lord's Love, the mind is satisfied.
The insane, self-willed manmukhs wander around, deluded by doubt.
Without the Lord, how can anyone survive? Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, He is realized. ||1||
Without the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, how can I live, O my mother?
Without the Lord, my soul cannot survive, even for an instant; the True Guru has helped me understand this. ||1||Pause||
Forgetting my God, I die in pain.
With each breath and morsel of food, I meditate on my Lord, and seek Him.
I remain always detached, but I am enraptured with the Lord's Name.
Now, as Gurmukh, I know that the Lord is always with me. ||2||
The Unspoken Speech is spoken, by the Will of the Guru.
He shows us that God is unapproachable and unfathomable.
Without the Guru, what lifestyle could we practice, and what work could we do?
Eradicating egotism, and walking in harmony with the Guru's Will, I am absorbed in the Word of the Shabad. ||3||
The self-willed manmukhs are separated from the Lord, gathering false wealth.
The Gurmukhs are celebrated with the glory of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
The Lord has showered His Mercy upon me, and made me the slave of His slaves.
The Name of the Lord is the wealth and capital of servant Nanak. ||4||4||
Bilaaval, Third Mehl, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Cursed, cursed is the food; cursed, cursed is the sleep; cursed, cursed are the clothes worn on the body.
Cursed is the body, along with family and friends, when one does not find his Lord and Master in this life.
He misses the step of the ladder, and this opportunity will not come into his hands again; his life is wasted, uselessly. ||1||
The love of duality does not allow him to lovingly focus his attention on the Lord; he forgets the Feet of the Lord.
O Life of the World, O Great Giver, you eradicate the sorrows of your humble servants. ||1||Pause||
You are Merciful, O Great Giver of Mercy; what are these poor beings?
All are liberated or placed into bondage by You; this is all one can say.
One who becomes Gurmukh is said to be liberated, while the poor self-willed manmukhs are in bondage. ||2||
He alone is liberated, who lovingly focuses his attention on the One Lord, always dwelling with the Lord.
His depth and condition cannot be described. The True Lord Himself embellishes him.
