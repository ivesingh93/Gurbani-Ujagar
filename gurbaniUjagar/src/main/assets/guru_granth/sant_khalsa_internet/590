O Nanak, without serving the True Guru, they are bound and beaten in the City of Death; they arise and depart with blackened faces. ||1||
First Mehl:
Burn away those rituals which lead you to forget the Beloved Lord.
O Nanak, sublime is that love, which preserves my honor with my Lord Master. ||2||
Pauree:
Serve the One Lord, the Great Giver; meditate on the One Lord.
Beg from the One Lord, the Great Giver, and you shall obtain your heart's desires.
But if you beg from another, then you shall be shamed and destroyed.
One who serves the Lord obtains the fruits of his rewards; all of his hunger is satisfied.
Nanak is a sacrifice to those, who night and day, meditate within their hearts on the Name of the Lord. ||10||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
He Himself is pleased with His humble devotees; my Beloved Lord attaches them to Himself.
The Lord blesses His humble devotees with royalty; He fashions the true crown upon their heads.
They are always at peace, and immaculately pure; they perform service for the True Guru.
They are not said to be kings, who dIE in conflict, and then enter again the cycle of reincarnation.
O Nanak, without the Name of the Lord, they wander about with their noses cut off in disgrace; they get no respect at all. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Hearing the teachings, he does not appreciate them, as long as he is not Gurmukh, attached to the Word of the Shabad.
Serving the True Guru, the Naam comes to abide in the mind, and doubts and fears run away.
As he knows the True Guru, so he is transformed, and then, he lovingly focuses his consciousness on the Naam.
O Nanak, through the Naam, the Name of the Lord, greatness is obtained; he shall be resplendent in the Court of the Lord hereafter. ||2||
Pauree:
The minds of the GurSikhs are filled with the love of the Lord; they come and worship the Guru.
They trade lovingly in the Lord's Name, and depart after earning the profit of the Lord's Name.
The faces of the GurSikhs are radiant; in the Court of the Lord, they are approved.
The Guru, the True Guru, is the treasure of the Lord's Name; how very fortunate are the Sikhs who share in this treasure of virtue.
I am a sacrifice to those GurSikhs who, sitting and standing, meditate on the Lord's Name. ||11||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the treasure, which the Gurmukhs obtain.
The self-willed manmukhs are blind; they do not realize that it is within their own home. They dIE barking and crying. ||1||
Third Mehl:
That body is golden and immaculate, which is attached to the True Name of the True Lord.
The Gurmukh obtains the Pure Light of the Luminous Lord, and his doubts and fears run away.
O Nanak, the Gurmukhs find lasting peace; night and day, they remain detached, while in the Love of the Lord. ||2||
Pauree:
Blessed, blessed are those GurSikhs, who, with their ears, listen to the Guru's Teachings about the Lord.
The Guru, the True Guru, implants the Naam within them, and their egotism and duality are silenced.
There is no friend, other than the Name of the Lord; the Lord's humble servants reflect upon this and see.
