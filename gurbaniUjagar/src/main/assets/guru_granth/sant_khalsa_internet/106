He is the Giver of all souls.
By Guru's Grace, He blesses us with His Glance of Grace.
The beings in the water, on the land and in the sky are all satisfied; I wash the Feet of the Holy. ||3||
He is the Fulfiller of the desires of the mind.
Forever and ever, I am a sacrifice to Him.
O Nanak, the Destroyer of pain has given this Gift; I am imbued with the Love of the Delightful Lord. ||4||32||39||
Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
Mind and body are Yours; all wealth is Yours.
You are my God, my Lord and Master.
Body and soul and all riches are Yours. Yours is the Power, O Lord of the World. ||1||
Forever and ever, You are the Giver of Peace.
I bow down and fall at Your Feet.
I act as it pleases You, as You cause me to act, Kind and Compassionate Dear Lord. ||2||
O God, from You I receive; You are my decoration.
Whatever You give me, brings me happiness.
Wherever You keep me, is heaven. You are the Cherisher of all. ||3||
Meditating, meditating in remembrance, Nanak has found peace.
Twenty-four hours a day, I sing Your Glorious Praises.
All my hopes and desires are fulfilled; I shall never again suffer sorrow. ||4||33||40||
Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
The Supreme Lord God has unleashed the rain clouds.
Over the sea and over the land-over all the earth's surface, in all directions, He has brought the rain.
Peace has come, and the thirst of all has been quenched; there is joy and ecstasy everywhere. ||1||
He is the Giver of Peace, the Destroyer of pain.
He gives and forgives all beings.
He Himself nurtures and cherishes His Creation. I fall at His Feet and surrender to Him. ||2||
Seeking His Sanctuary, salvation is obtained.
With each and every breath, I meditate on the Lord's Name.
Without Him, there is no other Lord and Master. All places belong to Him. ||3||
Yours is the Honor, God, and Yours is the Power.
You are the True Lord and Master, the Ocean of Excellence.
Servant Nanak utters this prayer: may I meditate on You twenty-four hours a day. ||4||34||41||
Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
All happiness comes, when God is pleased.
The Feet of the Perfect Guru dwell in my mind.
I am intuitively absorbed in the state of Samaadhi deep within. God alone knows this sweet pleasure. ||1||
My Lord and Master is Inaccessible and Unfathomable.
Deep within each and every heart, He dwells near and close at hand.
He is always detached; He is the Giver of souls. How rare is that person who understands his own self. ||2||
This is the sign of union with God:
in the mind, the Command of the True Lord is recognized.
Intuitive peace and poise, contentment, enduring satisfaction and bliss come through the Pleasure of the Master's Will. ||3||
God, the Great Giver, has given me His Hand.
He has erased all the sickness of birth and death.
O Nanak, those whom God has made His slaves, rejoice in the pleasure of singing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises. ||4||35||42||
