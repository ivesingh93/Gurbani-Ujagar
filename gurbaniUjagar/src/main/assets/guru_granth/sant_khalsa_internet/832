Bilaaval, First Mehl:
The human acts according to the wishes of the mind.
This mind feeds on virtue and vice.
Intoxicated with the wine of Maya, satisfaction never comes.
Satisfaction and liberation come, only to one whose mind is pleasing to the True Lord. ||1||
Gazing upon his body, wealth, wife and all his possessions, he is proud.
But without the Name of the Lord, nothing shall go along with him. ||1||Pause||
He enjoys tastes, pleasures and joys in his mind.
But his wealth will pass on to other people, and his body will be reduced to ashes.
The entire expanse, like dust, shall mix with dust.
Without the Word of the Shabad, his filth is not removed. ||2||
The various songs, tunes and rhythms are false.
Trapped by the three qualities, people come and go, far from the Lord.
In duality, the pain of their evil-mindedness does not leave them.
But the Gurmukh is emancipated by taking the medicine, and singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||3||
He may wear a clean loin-cloth, apply the ceremonial mark to his forehead, and wear a mala around his neck;
but if there is anger within him, he is merely reading his part, like an actor in a play.
Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he drinks in the wine of Maya.
Without devotional worship to the Guru, there is no peace. ||4||
The human is a pig, a dog, a donkey, a cat,
a beast, a filthy, lowly wretch, an outcast,
if he turns his face away from the Guru. He shall wander in reincarnation.
Bound in bondage, he comes and goes. ||5||
Serving the Guru, the treasure is found.
With the Naam in the heart, one always prospers.
And in the Court of the True Lord, you shall not called to account.
One who obeys the Hukam of the Lord's Command, is approved at the Lord's Door. ||6||
Meeting the True Guru, one knows the Lord.
Understanding the Hukam of His Command, one acts according to His Will.
Understanding the Hukam of His Command, he dwells in the Court of the True Lord.
Through the Shabad, death and birth are ended. ||7||
He remains detached, knowing that everything belongs to God.
He dedicates his body and mind unto the One who owns them.
He does not come, and he does not go.
O Nanak, absorbed in Truth, he merges in the True Lord. ||8||2||
Bilaaval, Third Mehl, Ashtapadees, Tenth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The world is like a crow; with its beak, it croaks spiritual wisdom.
But deep within there is greed, falsehood and pride.
Without the Name of the Lord, your thin outer covering shall wear off, you fool. ||1||
Serving the True Guru, the Naam shall dwell in your conscious mind.
Meeting with the Guru, the Name of the Lord comes to mind. Without the Name, other loves are false. ||1||Pause||
So do that work, which the Guru tells you to do.
Contemplating the Word of the Shabad, you shall come to the home of celestial bliss.
Through the True Name, you shall obtain glorious greatness. ||2||
One who does not understand his own self, but still tries to instruct others,
is mentally blind, and acts in blindness.
How can he ever find a home and a place of rest, in the Mansion of the Lord's Presence? ||3||
Serve the Dear Lord, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts;
deep within each and every heart, His Light is shining forth.
How can anyone hide anything from Him? ||4||
