I have loaded the Wealth of the Lord's Name; the world has loaded poison. ||2||
O you who know this world and the world beyond: write whatever nonsense you please about me.
The club of the Messenger of Death shall not strike me, since I have cast off all entanglements. ||3||
Love of this world is like the pale, temporary color of the safflower.
The color of my Lord's Love, however, is permanent, like the dye of the madder plant. So says Ravi Daas, the tanner. ||4||1||
Gauree Poorbee, Ravi Daas Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The frog in the deep well knows nothing of its own country or other lands;
just so, my mind, infatuated with corruption, understands nothing about this world or the next. ||1||
O Lord of all worlds: reveal to me, even for an instant, the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. ||1||Pause||
My intellect is polluted; I cannot understand Your state, O Lord.
Take pity on me, dispel my doubts, and teach me true wisdom. ||2||
Even the great Yogis cannot describe Your Glorious Virtues; they are beyond words.
I am dedicated to Your loving devotional worship, says Ravi Daas the tanner. ||3||1||
Gauree Bairaagan:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
In the Golden Age of Sat Yuga, was Truth; in the Silver Age of Trayta Yuga, charitable feasts; in the Brass Age of Dwaapar Yuga, there was worship.
In those three ages, people held to these three ways. But in the Iron Age of Kali Yuga, the Name of the Lord is your only Support. ||1||
How can I swim across?
No one has explained to me,
so that I might understand how I can escape reincarnation. ||1||Pause||
So many forms of religion have been described; the whole world is practicing them.
What actions will bring emancipation, and total perfection? ||2||
One may distinguish between good and evil actions, and listen to the Vedas and the Puraanas,
but doubt still persists. Skepticism continually dwells in the heart, so who can eradicate egotistical pride? ||3||
Outwardly, he washes with water, but deep within, his heart is tarnished by all sorts of vices.
So how can he become pure? His method of purification is like that of an elephant, covering himself with dust right after his bath! ||4||
With the rising of the sun, the night is brought to its end; the whole world knows this.
It is believed that with the touch of the Philosopher's Stone, copper is immediately transformed into gold. ||5||
When one meets the Supreme Philosopher's Stone, the Guru, if such pre-ordained destiny is written on one's forehead,
then the soul blends with the Supreme Soul, and the stubborn doors are opened wide. ||6||
Through the way of devotion, the intellect is imbued with Truth; doubts, entanglements and vices are cut away.
The mind is restrained, and one attains joy, contemplating the One Lord, who is both with and without qualities. ||7||
I have tried many methods, but by turning it away, the noose of doubt is not turned away.
Love and devotion have not welled up within me, and so Ravi Daas is sad and depressed. ||8||1||
One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:
