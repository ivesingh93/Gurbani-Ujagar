and through it, my honor was totally preserved. ||3||
I speak as You cause me to speak;
O Lord and Master, You are the ocean of excellence.
Nanak chants the Naam, the Name of the Lord, according to the Teachings of Truth.
God preserves the honor of His slaves. ||4||6||56||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
The Creator Lord Himself stood between us,
and not a hair upon my head was touched.
The Guru made my cleansing bath successful;
meditating on the Lord, Har, Har, my sins were erased. ||1||
O Saints, the purifying pool of Ram Das is sublime.
Whoever bathes in it, his family and ancestry are saved, and his soul is saved as well. ||1||Pause||
The world sings cheers of victory,
and the fruits of his mind's desires are obtained.
One is safe and sound who comes and bathes here,
and meditates on his God. ||2||
One who bathes in the healing pool of the Saints,
that humble being obtains the supreme status.
He does not die, or come and go in reincarnation;
he meditates on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||3||
He alone knows this about God,
whom God blesses with His kindness.
Baba Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of God;
all his worries and anxieties are dispelled. ||4||7||57||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
The Supreme Lord God has stood by me and fulfilled me,
and nothing is left unfinished.
Attached to the Guru's feet, I am saved;
I contemplate and cherish the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||
He is forever the Savior of His slaves.
Bestowing His Mercy, He made me His own and preserved me; like a mother or father, He cherishes me. ||1||Pause||
By great good fortune, I found the True Guru,
who obliterated the path of the Messenger of Death.
My consciousness is focused on loving, devotional worship of the Lord.
One who lives in this meditation is very fortunate indeed. ||2||
He sings the Ambrosial Word of the Guru's Bani,
and bathes in the dust of the feet of the Holy.
He Himself bestows His Name.
God, the Creator, saves us. ||3||
The Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan is the support of the breath of life.
This is the perfect, pure wisdom.
The Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, has granted His Mercy;
slave Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of his Lord and Master. ||4||8||58||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
The Perfect Guru has attached me to His feet.
I have obtained the Lord as my companion, my support, my best friend.
Wherever I go, I am happy there.
By His Kind Mercy, God united me with Himself. ||1||
So sing forever the Glorious Praises of the Lord with loving devotion.
You shall obtain all the fruits of your mind's desires, and the Lord shall become the companion and the support of your soul. ||1||Pause||
The Lord is the support of the breath of life.
I am the dust of the feet of the Holy people.
I am a sinner, but the Lord made me pure.
By His Kind Mercy, the Lord blessed me with His Praises. ||2||
The Supreme Lord God cherishes and nurtures me.
He is always with me, the Protector of my soul.
Singing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises day and night,
I shall not be consigned to reincarnation again. ||3||
One who is blessed by the Primal Lord, the Architect of Destiny,
realizes the subtle essence of the Lord.
The Messenger of Death does not come near him.
In the Lord's Sanctuary, Nanak has found peace. ||4||9||59||
