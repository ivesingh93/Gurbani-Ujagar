The Lord of the Universe is beautiful, proficient, wise and all-knowing;
His Virtues are priceless. By great good fortune, I have found Him; my pain is dispelled, and my hopes are fulfilled.
Prays Nanak, I have entered Your Sanctuary, Lord, and my fear of death is eradicated. ||2||
Shalok:
Without the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, one dies wandering around in confusion, performing all sorts of rituals.
O Nanak, all are bound by the attractive bonds of Maya, and the karmic record of past actions. ||1||
Those who are pleasing to God are united with Him; He separates others from Himself.
Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of God; His greatness is glorious! ||2||
Chhant:
In the summer season, in the months of Jayt'h and Asaarh, the heat is terrible, intense and severe.
The discarded bride is separated from His Love, and the Lord does not even look at her.
She does not see her Lord, and she dies with an aching sigh; she is defrauded and plundered by her great pride.
She flails around, like a fish out of water; attached to Maya, she is alienated from the Lord.
She sins, and so she is fearful of reincarnation; the Messenger of Death will surely punish her.
Prays Nanak, take me under Your sheltering support, Lord, and protect me; You are the Fulfiller of desire. ||3||
Shalok:
With loving faith, I am attached to my Beloved; I cannot survive without Him, even for an instant.
He is permeating and pervading my mind and body, O Nanak, with intuitive ease. ||1||
My Friend has taken me by the hand; He has been my best friend, lifetime after lifetime.
He has made me the slave of His feet; O Nanak, my consciousness is filled with love for God. ||2||
Chhant:
The rainy season is beautiful; the months of Saawan and Bhaadon bring bliss.
The clouds are low, and heavy with rain; the waters and the lands are filled with honey.
God is all-pervading everywhere; the nine treasures of the Lord's Name fill the homes of all hearts.
Meditating in remembrance on the Lord and Master, the Searcher of hearts, all one's ancestry is saved.
No blemish sticks to that being who remains awake and aware in the Love of the Lord; the Merciful Lord is forever forgiving.
Prays Nanak, I have found my Husband Lord, who is forever pleasing to my mind. ||4||
Shalok:
Thirsty with desire, I wander around; when will I behold the Lord of the World?
Is there any humble Saint, any friend, O Nanak, who can lead me to meet with God? ||1||
Without meeting Him, I have no peace or tranquility; I cannot survive for a moment, even for an instant.
Entering the Sanctuary of the Lord's Holy Saints, O Nanak, my desires are fulfilled. ||2||
Chhant:
In the cool, autumn season, in the months of Assu and Katik, I am thirsty for the Lord.
Searching for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, I wander around wondering, when will I meet my Lord, the treasure of virtue?
Without my Beloved Husband Lord, I find no peace, and all my necklaces and bracelets become cursed.
So beautiful, so wise, so clever and knowing; still, without the breath, it is just a body.
I look here and there, in the ten directions; my mind is so thirsty to meet God!
Prays Nanak, shower Your Mercy upon me; unite me with Yourself, O God, O treasure of virtue. ||5||
Shalok:
The fire of desire is cooled and quenched; my mind and body are filled with peace and tranquility.
O Nanak, I have met my Perfect God; the illusion of duality is dispelled. ||1||
