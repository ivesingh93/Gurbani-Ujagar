Siree Raag, First Mehl, Third House:
Make good deeds the soil, and let the Word of the Shabad be the seed; irrigate it continually with the water of Truth.
Become such a farmer, and faith will sprout. This brings knowledge of heaven and hell, you fool! ||1||
Do not think that your Husband Lord can be obtained by mere words.
You are wasting this life in the pride of wealth and the splendor of beauty. ||1||Pause||
The defect of the body which leads to sin is the mud puddle, and this mind is the frog, which does not appreciate the lotus flower at all.
The bumble bee is the teacher who continually teaches the lesson. But how can one understand, unless one is made to understand? ||2||
This speaking and listening is like the song of the wind, for those whose minds are colored by the love of Maya.
The Grace of the Master is bestowed upon those who meditate on Him alone. They are pleasing to His Heart. ||3||
You may observe the thirty fasts, and say the five prayers each day, but 'Satan' can undo them.
Says Nanak, you will have to walk on the Path of Death, so why do you bother to collect wealth and property? ||4||27||
Siree Raag, First Mehl, Fourth House:
He is the Master who has made the world bloom; He makes the Universe blossom forth, fresh and green.
He holds the water and the land in bondage. Hail to the Creator Lord! ||1||
Death, O Mullah-death will come,
so live in the Fear of God the Creator. ||1||Pause||
You are a Mullah, and you are a Qazi, only when you know the Naam, the Name of God.
You may be very educated, but no one can remain when the measure of life is full. ||2||
He alone is a Qazi, who renounces selfishness and conceit, and makes the One Name his Support.
The True Creator Lord is, and shall always be. He was not born; He shall not die. ||3||
You may chant your prayers five times each day; you may read the Bible and the Koran.
Says Nanak, the grave is calling you, and now your food and drink are finished. ||4||28||
Siree Raag, First Mehl, Fourth House:
The dogs of greed are with me.
In the early morning, they continually bark at the wind.
Falsehood is my dagger; through deception, I eat the carcasses of the dead.
I live as a wild hunter, O Creator! ||1||
I have not followed good advice, nor have I done good deeds.
I am deformed and horribly disfigured.
Your Name alone, Lord, saves the world.
This is my hope; this is my support. ||1||Pause||
With my mouth I speak slander, day and night.
I spy on the houses of others-I am such a wretched low-life!
Unfulfilled sexual desire and unresolved anger dwell in my body, like the outcasts who cremate the dead.
I live as a wild hunter, O Creator! ||2||
I make plans to trap others, although I appear gentle.
I am a robber-I rob the world.
I am very clever-I carry loads of sin.
I live as a wild hunter, O Creator! ||3||
I have not appreciated what You have done for me, Lord; I take from others and exploit them.
What face shall I show You, Lord? I am a sneak and a thief.
Nanak describes the state of the lowly.
I live as a wild hunter, O Creator! ||4||29||
Siree Raag, First Mehl, Fourth House:
There is one awareness among all created beings.
None have been created without this awareness.
