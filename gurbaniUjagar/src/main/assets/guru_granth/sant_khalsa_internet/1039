You are the Great Giver; I am Your slave.
Please be merciful and bless me with Your Ambrosial Naam, and the jewel, the lamp of the Guru's spiritual wisdom. ||6||
From the union of the five elements, this body was made.
Finding the Lord, the Supreme Soul, peace is established.
The good karma of past actions brings fruitful rewards, and man is blessed with the jewel of the Lord's Name. ||7||
His mind does not feel any hunger or thirst.
He knows the Immaculate Lord to be everywhere, in each and every heart.
Imbued with the Lord's Ambrosial essence, he becomes a pure, detached renunciate; he is lovingly absorbed in the Guru's Teachings. ||8||
Those who live a spiritual lifestyle, day and night,
sees the immaculate Divine Light deep within.
Enraptured with the delightful essence of the Shabad, the source of nectar, my tongue plays the sweet music of the flute. ||9||
He alone plays the sweet music of this flute,
who knows the three worlds.
O Nanak, know this, through the Guru's Teachings, and lovingly focus yourself on the Lord's Name. ||10||
Rare are those beings in this world,
who contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and remain detached.
They save themselves, and save all their associates and ancestors; fruitful is their birth and coming into this world. ||11||
He alone knows the home of his own heart, and the door to the temple,
who obtains perfect understanding from the Guru.
In the body-fortress is the palace; God is the True Master of this Palace. The True Lord established His True Throne there. ||12||
The fourteen realms and the two lamps are the witnesses.
The Lord's servants, the self-elect, do not taste the poison of corruption.
Deep within, is the priceless, incomparable commodity; meeting with the Guru, the wealth of the Lord is obtained. ||13||
He alone sits on the throne, who is worthy of the throne.
Following the Guru's Teachings, he subdues the five demons, and becomes the Lord's foot soldier.
He has existed from the very beginning of time and throughout the ages; He exists here and now, and will always exist. Meditating on Him, skepticism and doubt are dispelled. ||14||
The Lord of the Throne is greeted and worshipped day and night.
This true glorious greatness comes to those who love the Guru's Teachings.
O Nanak, meditate on the Lord, and swim across the river; they find the Lord, their best friend, in the end. ||15||1||18||
Maaroo, First Mehl:
Gather in the wealth of the Lord, O humble Siblings of Destiny.
Serve the True Guru, and remain in His Sanctuary.
This wealth cannot be stolen; the celestial melody of the Shabad wells up and keeps us awake and aware. ||1||
You are the One Universal Creator, the Immaculate King.
You Yourself arrange and resolve the affairs of Your humble servant.
You are immortal, immovable, infinite and priceless; O Lord, Your place is beautiful and eternal. ||2||
In the body-village, the most sublime place,
the supremely noble people dwell.
Above them is the Immaculate Lord, the One Universal Creator; they are lovingly absorbed in the profound, primal state of Samaadhi. ||3||
There are nine gates to the body-village;
the Creator Lord fashioned them for each and every person.
Within the Tenth Gate, dwells the Primal Lord, detached and unequalled. The unknowable reveals Himself. ||4||
The Primal Lord cannot be held to account; True is His Celestial Court.
The Hukam of His Command is in effect; True is His Insignia.
O Nanak, search and examine your own home, and you shall find the Supreme Soul, and the Name of the Lord. ||5||
