All the continents, nether worlds, islands and worlds -

Do not think that, because of his human body, he is different.

We meet Him, only when He causes us to meet.
The Lord is revealed to those humble Gurmukhs, who have such pre-ordained destiny inscribed upon their foreheads. ||15||

Maaroo, Solahas, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Whatever is seen is You, O One Lord.
What the ears hear is the Word of Your Bani.
There is nothing else to be seen at all. You give support to all. ||1||
You Yourself are conscious of Your Creation.
You Yourself established Yourself, O God.
Creating Yourself, You formed the expanse of the Universe; You Yourself cherish and sustain each and every heart. ||2||
You created some to hold great and royal courts.
Some turn away from the world in renunciation, and some maintain their households.
