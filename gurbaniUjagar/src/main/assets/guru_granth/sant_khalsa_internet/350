that day alone would be auspicious, when he recognizes his Lord and Master. ||2||
Beholding the sight of the petitioner, compassion is not aroused.
No one lives without give and take.
The king administers justice only if his palm is greased.
No one is moved by the Name of God. ||3||
O Nanak, they are human beings in form and name only;
by their deeds they are dogs - this is the Command of the Lord's Court.
By Guru's Grace, if one sees himself as a guest in this world,
then he gains honor in the Court of the Lord. ||4||4||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
As much as the Shabad is in the mind, so much is Your melody; as much as the form of the universe is, so much is Your body, Lord.
You Yourself are the tongue, and You Yourself are the nose. Do not speak of any other, O my mother. ||1||
My Lord and Master is One;
He is the One and Only; O Siblings of Destiny, He is the One alone. ||1||Pause||
He Himself kills, and He Himself emancipates; He Himself gives and takes.
He Himself beholds, and He Himself rejoices; He Himself bestows His Glance of Grace. ||2||
Whatever He is to do, that is what He is doing. No one else can do anything.
As He projects Himself, so do we describe Him; this is all Your Glorious Greatness, Lord. ||3||
The Dark Age of Kali Yuga is the bottle of wine; Maya is the sweet wine, and the intoxicated mind continues to drink it in.
He Himself assumes all sorts of forms; thus poor Nanak speaks. ||4||5||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
Make your intellect your instrument, and love your tambourine;
thus bliss and lasting pleasure shall be produced in your mind.
This is devotional worship, and this is the practice of penance.
So dance in this love, and keep the beat with your feet. ||1||
Know that the perfect beat is the Praise of the Lord;
other dances produce only temporary pleasure in the mind. ||1||Pause||
Play the two cymbals of truth and contentment.
Let your ankle bells be the lasting Vision of the Lord.
Let your harmony and music be the elimination of duality.
So dance in this love, and keep the beat with your feet. ||2||
Let the fear of God within your heart and mind be your spinning dance,
and keep up, whether sitting or standing.
To roll around in the dust is to know that the body is only ashes.
So dance in this love, and keep the beat with your feet. ||3||
Keep the company of the disciples, the students who love the teachings.
As Gurmukh, listen to the True Name.
O Nanak, chant it, over and over again.
So dance in this love, and keep the beat with your feet. ||4||6||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
He created the air, and He supports the whole world; he bound water and fire together.
The blind, ten-headed Raavan had his heads cut off, but what greatness was obtained by killing him? ||1||
What Glories of Yours can be chanted?
You are totally pervading everywhere; You love and cherish all. ||1||Pause||
You created all beings, and You hold the world in Your Hands; what greatness is it to put a ring in the nose of the black cobra, as Krishna did?
Whose Husband are You? Who is Your wife? You are subtly diffused and pervading in all. ||2||
Brahma, the bestower of blessings, entered the stem of the lotus, with his relatives, to find the extent of the universe.
Proceeding on, he could not find its limits; what glory was obtained by killing Kansa, the king? ||3||
The jewels were produced and brought forth by churning the ocean of milk. The other gods proclaimed "We are the ones who did this!
Says Nanak, by hiding, how can the Lord be hidden? He has given each their share, one by one. ||4||7||
