The opportunity to work hard serving the Saadh Sangat is obtained, when the Divine Lord is pleased.
Everything is in the Hands of our Lord and Master; He Himself is the Doer of deeds.
I am a sacrifice to the True Guru, who fulfills all hopes and desires. ||3||
The One appears to be my Companion; the One is my Brother and Friend.
The elements and the components are all made by the One; they are held in their order by the One.
When the mind accepts, and is satisfied with the One, then the consciousness becomes steady and stable.
Then, one's food is the True Name, one's garments are the True Name, and one's Support, O Nanak, is the True Name. ||4||5||75||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
All things are received if the One is obtained.
The precious gift of this human life becomes fruitful when one chants the True Word of the Shabad.
One who has such destiny written on his forehead enters the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, through the Guru. ||1||
O my mind, focus your consciousness on the One.
Without the One, all entanglements are worthless; emotional attachment to Maya is totally false. ||1||Pause||
Hundreds of thousands of princely pleasures are enjoyed, if the True Guru bestows His Glance of Grace.
If He bestows the Name of the Lord, for even a moment, my mind and body are cooled and soothed.
Those who have such pre-ordained destiny hold tight to the Feet of the True Guru. ||2||
Fruitful is that moment, and fruitful is that time, when one is in love with the True Lord.
Suffering and sorrow do not touch those who have the Support of the Name of the Lord.
Grasping him by the arm, the Guru lifts them up and out, and carries them across to the other side. ||3||
Embellished and immaculate is that place where the Saints gather together.
He alone finds shelter, who has met the Perfect Guru.
Nanak builds his house upon that site where there is no death, no birth, and no old age. ||4||6||76||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
Meditate on Him, O my soul; He is the Supreme Lord over kings and emperors.
Place the hopes of your mind in the One, in whom all have faith.
Give up all your clever tricks, and grasp the Feet of the Guru. ||1||
O my mind, chant the Name with intuitive peace and poise.
Twenty-four hours a day, meditate on God. Constantly sing the Glories of the Lord of the Universe. ||1||Pause||
Seek His Shelter, O my mind; there is no other as Great as He.
Remembering Him in meditation, a profound peace is obtained. Pain and suffering will not touch you at all.
Forever and ever, work for God; He is our True Lord and Master. ||2||
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, you shall become absolutely pure, and the noose of death shall be cut away.
So offer your prayers to Him, the Giver of Peace, the Destroyer of fear.
Showing His Mercy, the Merciful Master shall resolve your affairs. ||3||
The Lord is said to be the Greatest of the Great; His Kingdom is the Highest of the High.
He has no color or mark; His Value cannot be estimated.
Please show Mercy to Nanak, God, and bless him with Your True Name. ||4||7||77||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
One who meditates on the Naam is at peace; his face is radiant and bright.
Obtaining it from the Perfect Guru, he is honored all over the world.
In the Company of the Holy, the One True Lord comes to abide within the home of the self. ||1||
