Your humble servant is not engrossed in them. ||2||
Your humble servant is tied by the rope of Your Love.
Says Ravi Daas, what benefit would I get by escaping from it? ||3||4||
Aasaa:
The Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har, Har, Har, Haray.
Meditating on the Lord, the humble are carried across to salvation. ||1||Pause||
Through the Lord's Name, Kabeer became famous and respected.
The accounts of his past incarnations were torn up. ||1||
Because of Naam Dayv's devotion, the Lord drank the milk he offered.
He shall not have to suffer the pains of reincarnation into the world again. ||2||
Servant Ravi Daas is imbued with the Lord's Love.
By Guru's Grace, he shall not have to go to hell. ||3||5||
How does the puppet of clay dance?
He looks and listens, hears and speaks, and runs around. ||1||Pause||
When he acquires something, he is inflated with ego.
But when his wealth is gone, then he cries and bewails. ||1||
In thought, word and deed, he is attached to the sweet and tangy flavors.
When he dies, no one knows where he has gone. ||2||
Says Ravi Daas, the world is just a dramatic play, O Siblings of Destiny.
I have enshrined love for the Lord, the star of the show. ||3||6||
Aasaa, The Word Of Devotee Dhanna Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
I wandered through countless incarnations, but mind, body and wealth never remain stable.
Attached to, and stained by the poisons of sexual desire and greed, the mind has forgotten the jewel of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
The poisonous fruit seems sweet to the demented mind, which does not know the difference between good and evil.
Turning away from virtue, his love for other things increases, and he weaves again the web of birth and death. ||1||
He does not know the way to the Lord, who dwells within his heart; burning in the trap, he is caught by the noose of death.
Gathering the poisonous fruits, he fills his mind with them, and he forgets God, the Supreme Being, from his mind. ||2||
The Guru has given the wealth of spiritual wisdom; practicing meditation, the mind becomes one with Him.
Embracing loving devotional worship for the Lord, I have come to know peace; satisfied and satiated, I have been liberated. ||3||
One who is filled with the Divine Light, recognizes the undeceivable Lord God.
Dhanna has obtained the Lord, the Sustainer of the World, as his wealth; meeting the humble Saints, he merges in the Lord. ||4||1||
Fifth Mehl:
Naam Dayv's mind was absorbed into God, Gobind, Gobind, Gobind.
The calico-printer, worth half a shell, became worth millions. ||1||Pause||
Abandoning weaving and stretching thread, Kabeer enshrined love for the Lord's lotus feet.
A weaver from a lowly family, he became an ocean of excellence. ||1||
Ravi Daas, who used to carry dead cows every day, renounced the world of Maya.
He became famous in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and obtained the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan. ||2||
Sain, the barber, the village drudge, became famous in each and every house.
The Supreme Lord God dwelled in his heart, and he was counted among the devotees. ||3||
