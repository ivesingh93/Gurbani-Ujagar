I would cross the oceans, mountains, wilderness, forests and the nine regions of the earth,
in a single step, O Musan, for the Love of my Beloved. ||3||
O Musan, the Light of the Lord's Love has spread across the sky;
I cling to my Lord, like the bumble bee caught in the lotus flower. ||4||
Chanting and intense meditation, austere self-discipline, pleasure and peace, honor, greatness and pride -
O Musan, I would dedicate and sacrifice all these for a moment of my Lord's Love. ||5||
O Musan, the world does not understand the Mystery of the Lord; it is dying and being plundered.
It is not pierced through by the Love of the Beloved Lord; it is entangled in false pursuits. ||6||
When someone's home and property are burnt, because of his attachment to them, he suffers in the sorrow of separation.
O Musan, when mortals forget the Merciful Lord God, then they are truly plundered. ||7||
Whoever enjoys the taste of the Lord's Love, remembers His Lotus Feet in his mind.
O Nanak, the lovers of God do not go anywhere else. ||8||
Climbing thousands of steep hillsides, the fickle mind becomes miserable.
Look at the humble, lowly mud, O Jamaal: the beautiful lotus grows in it. ||9||
My Lord has lotus-eyes; His Face is so beautifully adorned.
O Musan, I am intoxicated with His Mystery. I break the necklace of pride into bits. ||10||
I am intoxicated with the Love of my Husband Lord; remembering Him in meditation, I am not conscious of my own body.
He is revealed in all His Glory, all throughout the world. Nanak is a lowly moth at His Flame. ||11||
Shaloks Of Devotee Kabeer Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Kabeer, my rosary is my tongue, upon which the Lord's Name is strung.
From the very beginning, and throughout the ages, all the devotees abide in tranquil peace. ||1||
Kabeer, everyone laughs at my social class.
I am a sacrifice to this social class, in which I chant and meditate on the Creator. ||2||
Kabeer, why do you stumble? Why does your soul waver?
He is the Lord of all comforts and peace; drink in the Sublime Essence of the Lord's Name. ||3||
Kabeer, earrings made of gold and studded with jewels,
look like burnt twigs, if the Name is not in the mind. ||4||
Kabeer, rare is such a person, who remains dead while yet alive.
Singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, he is fearless. Wherever I look, the Lord is there. ||5||
Kabeer, on the day when I die, afterwards there shall be bliss.
I shall meet with my Lord God. Those with me shall meditate and vibrate on the Lord of the Universe. ||6||
Kabeer, I am the worst of all. Everyone else is good.
Whoever understands this is a friend of mine. ||7||
Kabeer, she came to me in various forms and disguises.
My Guru saved me, and now she bows humbly to me. ||8||
Kabeer, kill only that, which, when killed, shall bring peace.
Everyone shall call you good, very good, and no one shall think you are bad. ||9||
Kabeer, the night is dark, and men go about doing their dark deeds.
