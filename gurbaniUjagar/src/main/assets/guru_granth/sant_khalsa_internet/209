Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
O Saint, You are attuned to the Lord.
Please stand my me, Architect of Destiny; please take me to my destination, Great Giver. ||1||Pause||
You alone know Your mystery; You are the Perfect Architect of Destiny.
I am a helpless orphan - please keep me under Your Protection and save me. ||1||
Your Feet are the boat to carry us across the world-ocean; You alone know Your ways.
Those whom You keep protected, by Your Kindness, cross over to the other side. ||2||
Here and hereafter, God, You are All-powerful; everything is in Your Hands.
Please give me that treasure, which will go along with me, O servant of the Lord. ||3||
I am without virtue - please bless me with virtue, so that my mind might chant the Name of the Lord.
By the Grace of the Saints, Nanak has met the Lord; his mind and body are soothed and satisfied. ||4||14||135||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
I am intuitively absorbed in the Divine Lord.
The Divine True Guru has become Merciful to me. ||1||Pause||
Cutting away the halter, He has made me His slave, and now I work for the Saints.
I have become a worshipper of the One Name; the Guru has shown me this amazing wonder. ||1||
The Divine Light has dawned, and everything is illuminated; the Guru has revealed this spiritual wisdom to my mind.
Drinking deeply of the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, my mind is satisfied, and my fears have been vanquished. ||2||
Accepting the Command of the Lord's Will, I have found total peace; the home of suffering has been destroyed.
When God, our Lord and Master was totally pleased, He revealed everything in the form of ecstasy. ||3||
Nothing comes, and nothing goes; this play is all set in motion by the Lord, the Sovereign King.
Says Nanak, our Lord and Master is inaccessible and unfathomable. The Lord's devotees take His Name as their Support. ||4||15||136||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
He is the Supreme Lord God, the Perfect Transcendent Lord; O my mind, hold tight to the Support of the One
who established the solar systems and galaxies. Chant the Name of that Lord. ||1||Pause||
Renounce the intellectual cleverness of your mind, O humble servants of the Lord; understanding the Hukam of His Command, peace is found.
Whatever God does, accept that with pleasure; in comfort and in suffering, meditate on Him. ||1||
The Creator emancipates millions of sinners in an instant, without a moment's delay.
The Lord, the Destroyer of the pain and sorrow of the poor, blesses those with whom He is pleased. ||2||
He is Mother and Father, the Cherisher of all; He is the Breath of life of all beings, the Ocean of peace.
While giving so generously, the Creator does not diminish at all. The Source of jewels, He is All-pervading. ||3||
The beggar begs for Your Name, O Lord and Master; God is contained deep within the nucleus of each and every heart.
Slave Nanak has entered His Sanctuary; no one returns from Him empty-handed. ||4||16||137||
