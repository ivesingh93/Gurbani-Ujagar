You are so Great! You are the Highest of the High!
You are Infinite, You are Everything!
I am a sacrifice to You. Nanak is the slave of Your slaves. ||8||1||35||
Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
Who is liberated, and who is united?
Who is a spiritual teacher, and who is a preacher?
Who is a house-holder, and who is a renunciate? Who can estimate the Lord's Value? ||1||
How is one bound, and how is one freed of his bonds?
How can one escape from the cycle of coming and going in reincarnation?
Who is subject to karma, and who is beyond karma? Who chants the Name, and inspires others to chant it? ||2||
Who is happy, and who is sad?
Who, as sunmukh, turns toward the Guru, and who, as vaymukh, turns away from the Guru?
How can one meet the Lord? How is one separated from Him? Who can reveal the way to me? ||3||
What is that Word, by which the wandering mind can be restrained?
What are those teachings, by which we may endure pain and pleasure alike?
What is that lifestyle, by which we may come to meditate on the Supreme Lord? How may we sing the Kirtan of His Praises? ||4||
The Gurmukh is liberated, and the Gurmukh is linked.
The Gurmukh is the spiritual teacher, and the Gurmukh is the preacher.
Blessed is the Gurmukh, the householder and the renunciate. The Gurmukh knows the Lord's Value. ||5||
Egotism is bondage; as Gurmukh, one is emancipated.
The Gurmukh escapes the cycle of coming and going in reincarnation.
The Gurmukh performs actions of good karma, and the Gurmukh is beyond karma. Whatever the Gurmukh does, is done in good faith. ||6||
The Gurmukh is happy, while the self-willed manmukh is sad.
The Gurmukh turns toward the Guru, and the self-willed manmukh turns away from the Guru.
The Gurmukh is united with the Lord, while the manmukh is separated from Him. The Gurmukh reveals the way. ||7||
The Guru's Instruction is the Word, by which the wandering mind is restrained.
Through the Guru's Teachings, we can endure pain and pleasure alike.
To live as Gurmukh is the lifestyle by which we come to meditate on the Supreme Lord. The Gurmukh sings the Kirtan of His Praises. ||8||
The Lord Himself created the entire creation.
He Himself acts, and causes others to act. He Himself establishes.
From oneness, He has brought forth the countless multitudes. O Nanak, they shall merge into the One once again. ||9||2||36||
Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
God is Eternal and Imperishable, so why should anyone be anxious?
The Lord is Wealthy and Prosperous, so His humble servant should feel totally secure.
O Giver of peace of the soul, of life, of honor-as You ordain, I obtain peace. ||1||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to that Gurmukh whose mind and body are pleased with You.
You are my mountain, You are my shelter and shield. No one can rival You. ||1||Pause||
That person, unto whom Your actions seem sweet,
comes to see the Supreme Lord God in each and every heart.
In all places and interspaces, You exist. You are the One and Only Lord, pervading everywhere. ||2||
You are the Fulfiller of all the mind's desires.
Your treasures are overflowing with love and devotion.
Showering Your Mercy, You protect those who, through perfect destiny, merge into You. ||3||
