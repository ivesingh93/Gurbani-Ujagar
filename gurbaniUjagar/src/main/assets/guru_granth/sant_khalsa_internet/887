Drinking it in, one becomes immortal and free of desire.
The body and mind are cooled and soothed, and the fire is extinguished.
Such a being is the embodiment of bliss, famous throughout the world. ||2||
What can I offer You, Lord? Everything belongs to You.
I am forever a sacrifice to You, hundreds of thousands of times.
You blessed me, and fashioned my body, mind and soul.
By Guru's Grace, this lowly being was exalted. ||3||
Opening the door, You summoned me to the Mansion of Your Presence.
As You are, so You have revealed Yourself to me.
Says Nanak, the screen is totally torn away;
I am Yours, and You are enshrined within my mind. ||4||3||14||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
He has linked His servant to His service.
The Divine Guru has poured the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, into his mouth.
He has subdued all his anxiety.
I am forever a sacrifice to that Guru. ||1||
The True Guru has perfectly resolved my affairs.
The True Guru vibrates the unstruck melody of the sound current. ||1||Pause||
His Glory is profound and unfathomable.
One whom He blesses with patience becomes blissful.
One whose bonds are shattered by the Sovereign Lord
is not cast into the womb of reincarnation again. ||2||
One who is illuminated by the Lord's radiance within,
is not touched by pain and sorrow.
He holds in his robe the gems and jewels.
That humble being is saved, along with all his generations. ||3||

He worships and adores the One Immaculate Lord alone.
Wherever I look, I see the Merciful Lord.
Says Nanak, I have found God, the source of nectar. ||4||4||15||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
My self-conceit has been eliminated from my body.
The Will of God is dear to me.
Whatever He does, seems sweet to my mind.
And then, these eyes behold the wondrous Lord. ||1||
Now, I have become wise and my demons are gone.
My thirst is quenched, and my attachment is dispelled. The Perfect Guru has instructed me. ||1||Pause||
In His Mercy, the Guru has kept me under His protection.
The Guru has attached me to the Lord's Feet.
When the mind is totally held in check,
one sees the Guru and the Supreme Lord God as one and the same. ||2||
Whoever You have created, I am his slave.
My God dwells in all.
I have no enemies, no adversaries.
I walk arm in arm, like brothers, with all. ||3||
One whom the Guru, the Lord, blesses with peace,
does not suffer in pain any longer.
He Himself cherishes all.
Nanak is imbued with the love of the Lord of the World. ||4||5||16||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
You read the scriptures, and the commentaries,
but the Perfect Lord does not dwell in your heart.
You preach to others to have faith,
but you do not practice what you preach. ||1||
O Pandit, O religious scholar, contemplate the Vedas.
Eradicate anger from your mind, O Pandit. ||1||Pause||
You place your stone god before yourself,
