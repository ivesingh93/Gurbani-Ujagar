Says Nanak, I have one article of faith; my Guru is the One who releases me from bondage. ||2||6||25||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
Your Saints have overwhelmed the wicked army of corruption.
They take Your Support and place their faith in You, O my Lord and Master; they seek Your Sanctuary. ||1||Pause||
Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, the terrible sins of countless lifetimes are erased.
I am illumined, enlightened and filled with ecstasy. I am intuitively absorbed in Samaadhi. ||1||
Who says that You cannot do everything? You are Infinitely All-powerful.
O Treasure of Mercy, Nanak savors Your Love and Your Blissful Form, earning the Profit of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||7||26||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
The drowning mortal is comforted and consoled, meditating on the Lord.
He is rid of emotional attachment, doubt, pain and suffering. ||1||Pause||
I meditate in remembrance, day and night, on the Guru's Feet.
Wherever I look, I see Your Sanctuary. ||1||
By the Grace of the Saints, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
Meeting with the Guru, Nanak has found peace. ||2||8||27||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
Meditating in remembrance on the Naam, peace of mind is found.
Meeting the Holy Saint, sing the Praises of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Granting His Grace, God has come to dwell within my heart.
I touch my forehead to the feet of the Saints. ||1||
Meditate, O my mind, on the Supreme Lord God.
As Gurmukh, Nanak listens to the Praises of the Lord. ||2||9||28||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
My mind loves to touch the Feet of God.
My tongue is satisfied with the Food of the Lord, Har, Har. My eyes are contented with the Blessed Vision of God. ||1||Pause||
My ears are filled with the Praise of my Beloved; all my foul sins and faults are erased.
My feet follow the Path of Peace to my Lord and Master; my body and limbs joyfully blossom forth in the Society of the Saints. ||1||
I have taken Sanctuary in my Perfect, Eternal, Imperishable Lord. I do not bother trying anything else.
Taking them by the hand, O Nanak, God saves His humble servants; they shall not perish in the deep, dark world-ocean. ||2||10||29||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
Those fools who bellow with rage and destructive deceit, are crushed and killed innumerable times. ||1||Pause||
Intoxicated with egotism and imbued with other tastes, I am in love with my evil enemies. My Beloved watches over me as I wander through thousands of incarnations. ||1||
My dealings are false, and my lifestyle is chaotic. Intoxicated with the wine of emotion, I am burning in the fire of anger.
O Merciful Lord of the World, Embodiment of Compassion, Relative of the meek and the poor, please save Nanak; I seek Your Sanctuary. ||2||11||30||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
The Giver of the soul, the breath of life and honor
- forgetting the Lord, all is lost. ||1||Pause||
You have forsaken the Lord of the Universe, and become attached to another - you are throwing away the Ambrosial Nectar, to take dust.
What do you expect from corrupt pleasures? You fool! What makes you think that they will bring peace? ||1||
