Raag Gond, Chau-Padas, Fourth Mehl, First House:
If, in his conscious mind, he places his hopes in the Lord, then he shall obtain the fruits of all the many desires of his mind.
The Lord knows everything which happens to the soul. Not even an iota of one's effort goes to waste.
Place your hopes in the Lord, O my mind; the Lord and Master is pervading and permeating all. ||1||
O my mind, place your hopes in the Lord of the World, the Master of the Universe.
That hope which is placed in any other than the Lord - that hope is fruitless, and totally useless. ||1||Pause||
That which you can see, Maya, and all attachment to family - don't place your hopes in them, or your life will be wasted and lost.
Nothing is in their hands; what can these poor creatures do? By their actions, nothing can be done.
O my mind, place your hopes in the Lord, your Beloved, who shall carry you across, and save your whole family as well. ||2||
If you place your hopes in any other, in any friend other than the Lord, then you shall come to know that it is of no use at all.
This hope placed in other friends comes from the love of duality. In an instant, it is gone; it is totally false.
O my mind, place your hopes in the Lord, your True Beloved, who shall approve and reward you for all your efforts. ||3||
Hope and desire are all Yours, O my Lord and Master. As You inspire hope, so are the hopes held.
