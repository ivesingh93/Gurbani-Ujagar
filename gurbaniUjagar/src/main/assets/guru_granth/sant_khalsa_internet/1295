I cannot even describe the noble grandeur of such humble beings; the Lord, Har, Har, has made them sublime and exalted. ||3||
You, Lord are the Great Merchant-Banker; O God, my Lord and Master, I am just a poor peddler; please bless me with the wealth.
Please bestow Your Kindness and Mercy upon servant Nanak, God, so that he may load up the merchandise of the Lord, Har, Har. ||4||2||
Kaanraa, Fourth Mehl:
O mind, chant the Name of the Lord, and be enlightened.
Meet with the Saints of the Lord, and focus your love; remain balanced and detached within your own household. ||1||Pause||
I chant the Name of the Lord, Har-Har, within my heart; God the Merciful has shown His Mercy.
Night and day, I am in ecstasy; my mind has blossomed forth, rejuvenated. I am trying - I hope to meet my Lord. ||1||
I am in love with the Lord, my Lord and Master; I love Him with every breath and morsel of food I take.
My sins were burnt away in an instant; the noose of the bondage of Maya was loosened. ||2||
I am such a worm! What karma am I creating? What can I do? I am a fool, a total idiot, but God has saved me.
I am unworthy, heavy as stone, but joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, I am carried across to the other side. ||3||
The Universe which God created is all above me; I am the lowest, engrossed in corruption.
With the Guru, my faults and demerits have been erased. Servant Nanak has been united with God Himself. ||4||3||
Kaanraa, Fourth Mehl:
O my mind, chant the Name of the Lord, through the Guru's Word.
The Lord, Har, Har, has shown me His Mercy, and my evil-mindedness, love of duality and sense of alienation are totally gone, thanks to the Lord of the Universe. ||1||Pause||
There are so many forms and colors of the Lord. The Lord is pervading each and every heart, and yet He is hidden from view.
Meeting with the Lord's Saints, the Lord is revealed, and the doors of corruption are shattered. ||1||
The glory of the Saintly beings is absolutely great; they lovingly enshrine the Lord of Bliss and Delight within their hearts.
Meeting with the Lord's Saints, I meet with the Lord, just as when the calf is seen - the cow is there as well. ||2||
The Lord, Har, Har, is within the humble Saints of the Lord; they are exalted - they know, and they inspire others to know as well.
The fragrance of the Lord permeates their hearts; they have abandoned the foul stench. ||3||
You make those humble beings Your Own, God; You protect Your Own, O Lord.
The Lord is servant Nanak's companion; the Lord is his sibling, mother, father, relative and relation. ||4||4||
Kaanraa, Fourth Mehl:
O my mind, consciously chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
The commodity of the Lord, Har, Har, is locked in the fortress of Maya; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I have conquered the fortress. ||1||Pause||
In false doubt and superstition, people wander all around, lured by love and emotional attachment to their children and families.
But just like the passing shade of the tree, your body-wall shall crumble in an instant. ||1||
The humble beings are exalted; they are my breath of life and my beloveds; meeting them, my mind is filled with faith.
Deep within the heart, I am happy with the Pervading Lord; with love and joy, I dwell upon the Steady and Stable Lord. ||2||
