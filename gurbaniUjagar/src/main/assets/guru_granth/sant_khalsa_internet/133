Serving at the Feet of the Holy Saints, all desires are fulfilled. ||3||
In each and every heart, the One Lord is pervading. He is totally permeating the water, the land, and the sky. ||4||
I serve the Destroyer of sin, and I am sanctified by the dust of the feet of the Saints. ||5||
My Lord and Master Himself has saved me completely; I am comforted by meditating on the Lord. ||6||
The Creator has passed judgment, and the evil-doers have been silenced and killed. ||7||
Nanak is attuned to the True Name; he beholds the Presence of the Ever-present Lord. ||8||5||39||1||32||1||5||39||
Baarah Maahaa ~ The Twelve Months: Maajh, Fifth Mehl, Fourth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
By the actions we have committed, we are separated from You. Please show Your Mercy, and unite us with Yourself, Lord.
We have grown weary of wandering to the four corners of the earth and in the ten directions. We have come to Your Sanctuary, God.
Without milk, a cow serves no purpose.
Without water, the crop withers, and it will not bring a good price.
If we do not meet the Lord, our Friend, how can we find our place of rest?
Those homes, those hearts, in which the Husband Lord is not manifest-those towns and villages are like burning furnaces.
All decorations, the chewing of betel to sweeten the breath, and the body itself, are all useless and vain.
Without God, our Husband, our Lord and Master, all friends and companions are like the Messenger of Death.
This is Nanak's prayer: "Please show Your Mercy, and bestow Your Name.
O my Lord and Master, please unite me with Yourself, O God, in the Eternal Mansion of Your Presence". ||1||
In the month of Chayt, by meditating on the Lord of the Universe, a deep and profound joy arises.
Meeting with the humble Saints, the Lord is found, as we chant His Name with our tongues.
Those who have found God-blessed is their coming into this world.
Those who live without Him, for even an instant-their lives are rendered useless.
The Lord is totally pervading the water, the land, and all space. He is contained in the forests as well.
Those who do not remember God-how much pain must they suffer!
Those who dwell upon their God have great good fortune.
My mind yearns for the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan. O Nanak, my mind is so thirsty!
I touch the feet of one who unites me with God in the month of Chayt. ||2||
In the month of Vaisaakh, how can the bride be patient? She is separated from her Beloved.
She has forgotten the Lord, her Life-companion, her Master; she has become attached to Maya, the deceitful one.
Neither son, nor spouse, nor wealth shall go along with you-only the Eternal Lord.
Entangled and enmeshed in the love of false occupations, the whole world is perishing.
Without the Naam, the Name of the One Lord, they lose their lives in the hereafter.
Forgetting the Merciful Lord, they are ruined. Without God, there is no other at all.
Pure is the reputation of those who are attached to the Feet of the Beloved Lord.
