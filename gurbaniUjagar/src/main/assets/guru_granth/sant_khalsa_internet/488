Hearing this, Dhanna the Jaat applied himself to devotional worship.
The Lord of the Universe met him personally; Dhanna was so very blessed. ||4||2||
O my consciousness, why don't you remain conscious of the Merciful Lord? How can you recognize any other?
You may run around the whole universe, but that alone happens which the Creator Lord does. ||1||Pause||
In the water of the mother's womb, He fashioned the body with ten gates.
He gives it sustenance, and preserves it in fire - such is my Lord and Master. ||1||
The mother turtle is in the water, and her babies are out of the water. She has no wings to protect them, and no milk to feed them.
The Perfect Lord, the embodiment of supreme bliss, the Fascinating Lord takes care of them. See this, and understand it in your mind||2||
The worm lies hidden under the stone - there is no way for him to escape.
Says Dhanna, the Perfect Lord takes care of him. Fear not, O my soul. ||3||3||
Aasaa, The Word Of Shaykh Fareed Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
They alone are true, whose love for God is deep and heart-felt.
Those who have one thing in their heart, and something else in their mouth, are judged to be false. ||1||
Those who are imbued with love for the Lord, are delighted by His Vision.
Those who forget the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are a burden on the earth. ||1||Pause||
Those whom the Lord attaches to the hem of His robe, are the true dervishes at His Door.
Blessed are the mothers who gave birth to them, and fruitful is their coming into the world. ||2||
O Lord, Sustainer and Cherisher, You are infinite, unfathomable and endless.
Those who recognize the True Lord - I kiss their feet. ||3||
I seek Your Protection - You are the Forgiving Lord.
Please, bless Shaykh Fareed with the bounty of Your meditative worship. ||4||1||
Aasaa:
Says Shaykh Fareed, O my dear friend, attach yourself to the Lord.
This body shall turn to dust, and its home shall be a neglected graveyard. ||1||
You can meet the Lord today, O Shaykh Fareed, if you restrain your bird-like desires which keep your mind in turmoil. ||1||Pause||
If I had known that I was to die, and not return again,
I would not have ruined myself by clinging to the world of falsehood. ||2||
So speak the Truth, in righteousness, and do not speak falsehood.
The disciple ought to travel the route, pointed out by the Guru. ||3||
Seeing the youths being carried across, the hearts of the beautiful young soul-brides are encouraged.
Those who side with the glitter of gold, are cut down with a saw. ||4||
O Shaykh, no one's life is permanent in this world.
That seat, upon which we now sit - many others sat on it and have since departed. ||5||
As the swallows appear in the month of Katik, forest fires in the month of Chayt, and lightning in Saawan,
and as the bride's arms adorn her husband's neck in winter;||6||
Just so, the transitory human bodies pass away. Reflect upon this in your mind.
It takes six months to form the body, but it breaks in an instant. ||7||
O Fareed, the earth asks the sky, "Where have the boatmen gone?
Some have been cremated, and some lIE in their graves; their souls are suffering rebukes. ||8||2||
