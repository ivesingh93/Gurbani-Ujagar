They sit there, in the cave of deep Samaadhi;
the unique, perfect Lord God dwells there.
God holds conversations with His devotees.
There is no pleasure or pain, no birth or death there. ||3||
One whom the Lord Himself blesses with His Mercy,
obtains the Lord's wealth in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
Nanak prays to the merciful Primal Lord;
the Lord is my merchandise, and the Lord is my capital. ||4||24||35||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
The Vedas do not know His greatness.
Brahma does not know His mystery.
Incarnated beings do not know His limit.
The Transcendent Lord, the Supreme Lord God, is infinite. ||1||
Only He Himself knows His own state.
Others speak of Him only by hearsay. ||1||Pause||
Shiva does not know His mystery.
The gods gave grown weary of searching for Him.
The goddesses do not know His mystery.
Above all is the unseen, Supreme Lord God. ||2||
The Creator Lord plays His own plays.
He Himself separates, and He Himself unites.
Some wander around, while others are linked to His devotional worship.
By His actions, He makes Himself known. ||3||
Listen to the true story of the Saints.
They speak only of what they see with their eyes.
He is not involved with virtue or vice.
Nanak's God is Himself all-in-all. ||4||25||36||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
I have not tried to do anything through knowledge.
I have no knowledge, intelligence or spiritual wisdom.
I have not practiced chanting, deep meditation, humility or righteousness.
I know nothing of such good karma. ||1||
O my Beloved God, my Lord and Master,
there is none other than You. Even though I wander and make mistakes, I am still Yours, God. ||1||Pause||
I have no wealth, no intelligence, no miraculous spiritual powers; I am not enlightened.
I dwell in the village of corruption and sickness.
O my One Creator Lord God,
Your Name is the support of my mind. ||2||
Hearing, hearing Your Name, I live; this is my mind's consolation.
Your Name, God, is the Destroyer of sins.
You, O Limitless Lord, are the Giver of the soul.
He alone knows You, unto whom You reveal Yourself. ||3||
Whoever has been created, rests his hopes in You.
All worship and adore You, God, O treasure of excellence.
Slave Nanak is a sacrifice to You.
My merciful Lord and Master is infinite. ||4||26||37||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
The Savior Lord is merciful.
Millions of incarnations are eradicated in an instant, contemplating the Lord.
All beings worship and adore Him.
Receiving the Guru's Mantra, one meets God. ||1||
My God is the Giver of souls.
The Perfect Transcendent Lord Master, my God, imbues each and every heart. ||1||Pause||
My mind has grasped His Support.
My bonds have been shattered.
Within my heart, I meditate on the Lord, the embodiment of supreme bliss.
My mind is filled with ecstasy. ||2||
The Lord's Sanctuary is the boat to carry us across.
The Lord's Feet are the embodiment of life itself.
