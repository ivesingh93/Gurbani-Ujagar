Chant the Name of the Lord with your tongue, O mind.
According to the pre-ordained destiny written upon my forehead, I have found the Guru, and the Lord abides within my heart. ||1||Pause||
Entangled in Maya, the mortal wanders around. Save Your humble servant, O Lord,
as you saved Prahlaad from the clutches of Harnaakash; keep him in Your Sanctuary, Lord. ||2||
How can I describe the state and the condition, O Lord, of those many sinners you have purified?
Ravi Daas, the leather-worker, who worked with hides and carried dead animals was saved, by entering the Lord's Sanctuary. ||3||
O God, Merciful to the meek, carry Your devotees across the world-ocean; I am a sinner - save me from sin!
O Lord, make me the slave of the slave of Your slaves; servant Nanak is the slave of Your slaves. ||4||1||
Bilaaval, Fourth Mehl:
I am foolish, idiotic and ignorant; I seek Your Sanctuary, O Primal Being, O Lord beyond birth.
Have Mercy upon me, and save me, O my Lord and Master; I am a lowly stone, with no good karma at all. ||1||
O my mind, vibrate and meditate on the Lord, the Name of the Lord.
Under Guru's Instructions, obtain the sublime, subtle essence of the Lord; renounce other fruitless actions. ||1||Pause||
The humble servants of the Lord are saved by the Lord; I am worthless - it is Your glory to save me.
I have no other than You, O my Lord and Master; I meditate on the Lord, by my good karma. ||2||
Those who lack the Naam, the Name of the Lord, their lives are cursed, and they must endure terrible pain.
They are consigned to reincarnation over and over again; they are the most unfortunate fools, with no good karma at all. ||3||
The Naam is the Support of the Lord's humble servants; their good karma is pre-ordained.
The Guru, the True Guru, has implanted the Naam within servant Nanak, and his life is fruitful. ||4||2||
Bilaaval, Fourth Mehl:
My consciousness is lured by emotional attachment and corruption; is filled with evil-minded filth.
I cannot serve You, O God; I am ignorant - how can I cross over? ||1||
O my mind, chant the Name of the Lord, the Lord, the Lord of man.
God has showered His Mercy upon His humble servant; meeting with the True Guru, he is carried across. ||1||Pause||
O my Father, my Lord and Master, Lord God, please bless me with such understanding, that I may sing Your Praises.
Those who are attached to You are saved, like iron which is carried across with wood. ||2||
The faithless cynics have little or no understanding; they do not serve the Lord, Har, Har.
Those beings are unfortunate and vicious; they die, and are consigned to reincarnation, over and over again. ||3||
Those whom You unite with Yourself, O Lord and Master, bathe in the Guru's cleansing pool of contentment.
Vibrating upon the Lord, the filth of their evil-mindedness is washed away; servant Nanak is carried across. ||4||3||
Bilaaval, Fourth Mehl:
Come, O Saints, and join together, O my Siblings of Destiny; let us tell the Stories of the Lord, Har, Har.
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the boat in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga; the Word of the Guru's Shabad is the boatman to ferry us across. ||1||
O my mind, chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
According to the pre-ordained destiny inscribed upon your forehead, sing the Praises of the Lord; join the Holy Congregation, and cross over the world-ocean. ||1||Pause||
