O my Dear Beloved Lord, Your limits are not known.
You pervade the water, the land, and the sky; You Yourself are All-pervading. ||1||Pause||
Mind is the scale, consciousness the weights, and the performance of Your service is the appraiser.
Deep within my heart, I weigh my Husband Lord; in this way I focus my consciousness. ||2||
You Yourself are the balance, the weights and the scale; You Yourself are the weigher.
You Yourself see, and You Yourself understand; You Yourself are the trader. ||3||
The blind, low class wandering soul, comes for a moment, and departs in an instant.
In its company, Nanak dwells; how can the fool attain the Lord? ||4||2||9||
Raag Soohee, Fourth Mehl, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
My mind worships and adores the Lord's Name, through the Guru, and the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
All the desires of my mind and body have been fulfilled; all fear of death has been dispelled. ||1||
O my mind, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord's Name.
And when the Guru is pleased and satisfied, the mind is instructed; it then joyfully drinks in the subtle essence of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
The Sat Sangat, the True Congregation of the True Guru, is sublime and exalted. They sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord God.
Bless me with Your Mercy, Lord, and unite me with the Sat Sangat; I wash the feet of Your humble servants. ||2||
The Lord's Name is all. The Lord's Name is the essence of the Guru's Teachings, the juice, the sweetness of it.
I have found the Ambrosial Nectar, the Divine Water of the Lord's Name, and all my thirst for it is quenched. ||3||
The Guru, the True Guru, is my social status and honor; I have sold my head to the Guru.
Servant Nanak is called the chaylaa, the disciple of the Guru; O Guru, save the honor of Your servant. ||4||1||
Soohee, Fourth Mehl:
I chant and vibrate the Name of the Lord God, the Supreme Being, Har, Har; my poverty and problems have all been eradicated.
The fear of birth and death has been erased, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad; serving the Unmoving, Unchanging Lord, I am absorbed in peace. ||1||
O my mind, vibrate the Name of the most Beloved, Darling Lord.
I have dedicated my mind and body, and placed them in offering before the Guru; I have sold my head to the Guru, for a very dear price. ||1||Pause||
The kings and the rulers of men enjoy pleasures and delights, but without the Name of the Lord, death seizes and dispatches them all.
The Righteous Judge of Dharma strikes them over the heads with his staff, and when the fruits of their actions come into their hands, then they regret and repent. ||2||
Save me, save me, Lord; I am Your humble servant, a mere worm. I seek the Protection of Your Sanctuary, O Primal Lord, Cherisher and Nourisher.
Please bless me with the Blessed Vision of the Saint's Darshan, that I may find peace. O God, please fulfill the desires of Your humble servant. ||3||
You are the All-powerful, Great, Primal God, my Lord and Master. O Lord, please bless me with the gift of humility.
Servant Nanak has found the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and is at peace; I am forever a sacrifice to the Naam. ||4||2||
Soohee, Fourth Mehl:
The Lord's Name is the Love of the Lord. The Lord's Love is the permanent color.
When the Guru is totally satisfied and pleased, He colors us with the Lord's Love; this color shall never fade away. ||1||
