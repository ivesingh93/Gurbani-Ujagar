Says Nanak, sing continually the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
Your face shall be radiant, and your consciousness shall be immaculately pure. ||4||19||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The nine treasures are Yours - all treasures are Yours.
The Fulfiller of desires saves mortals in the end. ||1||
You are my Beloved, so what hunger can I have?
When You dwell within my mind, pain does not touch me. ||1||Pause||
Whatever You do, is acceptable to me.
O True Lord and Master, True is Your Order. ||2||
When it is pleasing to Your Will, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
Within Your Home, there is justice, forever and ever. ||3||
O True Lord and Master, You are unknowable and mysterious.
Nanak is committed to Your service. ||4||20||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
He is near at hand; He is the eternal Companion of the soul.
His Creative Power is all-pervading, in form and color. ||1||
My mind does not worry; it does not grieve, or cry out.
Imperishable, Unshakable, Unapproachable and forever safe and sound is my Husband Lord. ||1||Pause||
Unto whom does Your servant pay homage?
His King preserves his honor. ||2||
That slave, whom God has released from the restrictions of social status -
who can now hold him in bondage? ||3||
The Lord is absolutely independent, and totally care-free;
O servant Nanak, chant His Glorious Praises. ||4||21||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Forsaking the Lord's sublime essence, the mortal is intoxicated with false essences.
The substance is within the home of the self, but the mortal goes out to find it. ||1||
He cannot hear the true ambrosial discourse.
Attached to false scriptures, he is engaged in argument. ||1||Pause||
He takes his wages from his Lord and Master, but he serves another.
With such sins, the mortal is engrossed. ||2||
He tries to hide from the One who is always with him.
He begs from Him, again and again. ||3||
Says Nanak, God is merciful to the meek.
As it pleases Him, He cherishes us. ||4||22||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is my soul, my life, my wealth.
Here and hereafter, it is with me, to help me. ||1||
Without the Lord's Name, everything else is useless.
My mind is satisfied and satiated by the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan. ||1||Pause||
Gurbani is the jewel, the treasure of devotion.
Singing, hearing and acting upon it, one is enraptured. ||2||
My mind is attached to the Lord's Lotus Feet.
The True Guru, in His Pleasure, has given this gift. ||3||
Unto Nanak, the Guru has revealed these instructions:
recognize the Imperishable Lord God in each and every heart. ||4||23||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The All-pervading Lord has established joys and celebrations.
He Himself embellishes His own works. ||1||
Perfect is the Creation of the Perfect Lord Master.
His magnificent greatness is totally all-pervading. ||1||Pause||
His Name is the treasure; His reputation is immaculate.
He Himself is the Creator; there is no other. ||2||
All beings and creatures are in His Hands.
God is pervading in all, and is always with them. ||3||
