With the army of God's devotees, and Shakti, the power of meditation, I have snapped the noose of the fear of death.
Slave Kabeer has climbed to the top of the fortress; I have obtained the eternal, imperishable domain. ||6||9||17||
The mother Ganges is deep and profound.
Tied up in chains, they took Kabeer there. ||1||
My mind was not shaken; why should my body be afraid?
My consciousness remained immersed in the Lotus Feet of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
The waves of the Ganges broke the chains,
and Kabeer was seated on a deer skin. ||2||
Says Kabeer, I have no friend or companion.
On the water, and on the land, the Lord is my Protector. ||3||10||18||
Bhairao, Kabeer Jee, Ashtapadees, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
God constructed a fortress, inaccessible and unreachable, in which He dwells.
There, His Divine Light radiates forth.
Lightning blazes, and bliss prevails there,
where the Eternally Young Lord God abides. ||1||
This soul is lovingly attuned to the Lord's Name.
It is saved from old age and death, and its doubt runs away. ||1||Pause||
Those who believe in high and low social classes,
only sing songs and chants of egotism.
The Unstruck Sound-current of the Shabad, the Word of God, resounds in that place,
where the Supreme Lord God abides. ||2||
He creates planets, solar systems and galaxies;
He destroys the three worlds, the three gods and the three qualities.
The Inaccessible and Unfathomable Lord God dwells in the heart.
No one can find the limits or the secrets of the Lord of the World. ||3||
The Lord shines forth in the plantain flower and the sunshine.
He dwells in the pollen of the lotus flower.
The Lord's secret is within the twelve petals of the heart-lotus.
The Supreme Lord, the Lord of Lakshmi dwells there. ||4||
He is like the sky, stretching across the lower, upper and middle realms.
In the profoundly silent celestial realm, He radiates forth.
Neither the sun nor the moon are there,
but the Primal Immaculate Lord celebrates there. ||5||
Know that He is in the universe, and in the body as well.
Take your cleansing bath in the Mansarovar Lake.
Chant "Sohan" - "He is me.
He is not affected by either virtue or vice. ||6||
He is not affected by either high or low social class, sunshine or shade.
He is in the Guru's Sanctuary, and nowhere else.
He is not diverted by diversions, comings or goings.
Remain intuitively absorbed in the celestial void. ||7||
One who knows the Lord in the mind -
whatever he says, comes to pass.
One who firmly implants the Lord's Divine Light, and His Mantra within the mind-
says Kabeer, such a mortal crosses over to the other side. ||8||1||
Millions of suns shine for Him,
millions of Shivas and Kailash mountains.
Millions of Durga goddesses massage His Feet.
Millions of Brahmas chant the Vedas for Him. ||1||
When I beg, I beg only from the Lord.
I have nothing to do with any other deities. ||1||Pause||
Millions of moons twinkle in the sky.
