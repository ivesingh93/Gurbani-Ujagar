I ask and ask, with humility, "Who can tell me which country my Husband Lord lives in?"
I would dedicate my heart to him, I offer my mind and body and everything; I place my head at his feet. ||2||
I bow at the feet of the voluntary slave of the Lord; I beg him to bless me with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
Show Mercy to me, that I may meet God, and gaze upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan every moment. ||3||
When He is Kind to me, He comes to dwell within my being. Night and day, my mind is calm and peaceful.
Says Nanak, I sing the Songs of Joy; the Unstruck Word of the Shabad resounds within me. ||4||5||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
O mother, True, True, True is the Lord, and True, True, True is His Holy Saint.
The Word which the Perfect Guru has spoken, I have tied to my robe. ||1||Pause||
Night and day, and the stars in the sky shall vanish. The sun and the moon shall vanish.
The mountains, the earth, the water and the air shall pass away. Only the Word of the Holy Saint shall endure. ||1||
Those born of eggs shall pass away, and those born of the womb shall pass away. Those born of the earth and sweat shall pass away as well.
The four Vedas shall pass away, and the six Shaastras shall pass away. Only the Word of the Holy Saint is eternal. ||2||
Raajas, the quality of energetic activity shall pass away. Taamas, the quality of lethargic darkness shall pass away. Saatvas, the quality of peaceful light shall pass away as well.
All that is seen shall pass away. Only the Word of the Holy Saint is beyond destruction. ||3||
He Himself is Himself by Himself. All that is seen is His play.
He cannot be found by any means. O Nanak, meeting with the Guru, God is found. ||4||6||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
The Guru, the Lord of the Universe, dwells within my mind.
Wherever my Lord and Master is remembered in meditation - that village is filled with peace and bliss. ||1||Pause||
Wherever my Beloved Lord and Master is forgotten - all misery and misfortune is there.
Where the Praises of my Lord, the Embodiment of Bliss and Joy are sung - eternal peace and wealth are there. ||1||
Wherever they do not listen to the Stories of the Lord with their ears - the utterly desolate wilderness is there.
Where the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises are sung with love in the Saadh Sangat - there is fragrance and fruit and joy in abundance. ||2||
Without meditative remembrance on the Lord, one may live for millions of years, but his life would be totally useless.
But if he vibrates and meditates on the Lord of the Universe, for even a moment, then he shall live forever and ever. ||3||
O God, I seek Your Sanctuary, Your Sanctuary, Your Sanctuary; please mercifully bless me with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
O Nanak, the Lord is All-pervading everywhere, amongst all. He knows the qualities and the condition of all. ||4||7||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Now, I have obtained the Support of the Lord.
Those who seek the Sanctuary of the Ocean of Mercy are carried across the world-ocean. ||1||Pause||
They sleep in peace, and intuitively merge into the Lord. The Guru takes away their cynicism and doubt.
Whatever they wish for, the Lord does; they obtain the fruits of their minds' desires. ||1||
In my heart, I meditate on Him; with my eyes, I focus my meditation on Him. With my ears, I listen to His Sermon.
