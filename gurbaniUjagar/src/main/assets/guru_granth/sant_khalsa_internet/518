Remembering Him in meditation, happiness comes, and all sorrows and pains simply vanish. ||2||
Pauree:
He is without relatives, immaculate, all-powerful, unapproachable and infinite.
Truly, the True Lord is seen to be the Truest of the True.
Nothing established by You appears to be false.
The Great Giver gives sustenance to all those He has created.
He has strung all on only one thread; He has infused His Light in them.
By His Will, some drown in the terrifying world-ocean, and by His Will, some are carried across.
O Dear Lord, he alone meditates on You, upon whose forehead such blessed destiny is inscribed.
Your condition and state cannot be known; I am a sacrifice to You. ||1||
Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
When You are pleased, O Merciful Lord, you automatically come to dwell within my mind.
When You are pleased, O Merciful Lord, I find the nine treasures within the home of my own self.
When You are pleased, O Merciful Lord, I act according to the Guru's Instructions.
When You are pleased, O Merciful Lord, then Nanak is absorbed in the True One. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
Many sit on thrones, to the sounds of musical instruments.
O Nanak, without the True Name, no one's honor is safe. ||2||
Pauree:
The followers of the Vedas, the Bible and the Koran, standing at Your Door, meditate on You.
Uncounted are those who fall at Your Door.
Brahma meditates on You, as does Indra on his throne.
Shiva and Vishnu, and their incarnations, chant the Lord's Praise with their mouths,
as do the Pirs, the spiritual teachers, the prophets and the Shaykhs, the silent sages and the seers.
Through and through, the Formless Lord is woven into each and every heart.
One is destroyed through falsehood; through righteousness, one prospers.
Whatever the Lord links him to, to that he is linked. ||2||
Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
He is reluctant to do good, but eager to practice evil.
O Nanak, today or tomorrow, the feet of the careless fool shall fall into the trap. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
No matter how evil my ways are, still, Your Love for me is not concealed.
Nanak: You, O Lord, conceal my short-comings and dwell within my mind; You are my true friend. ||2||
Pauree:
I beg of You, O Merciful Lord: please, make me the slave of Your slaves.
I obtain the nine treasures and royalty; chanting Your Name, I live.
The great ambrosial treasure, the Nectar of the Naam, is in the home of the Lord's slaves.
In their company, I am in ecstasy, listening to Your Praises with my ears.
Serving them, my body is purified.
I wave the fans over them, and carry water for them; I grind the corn for them, and washing their feet, I am overjoyed.
By myself, I can do nothing; O God, bless me with Your Glance of Grace.
I am worthless - please, bless me with a seat in the place of worship of the Saints. ||3||
Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
O Friend, I pray that I may remain forever the dust of Your Feet.
Nanak has entered Your Sanctuary, and beholds You ever-present. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
Countless sinners become pure, by fixing their minds on the Feet of the Lord.
The Name of God is the sixty-eight holy places of pilgrimage, O Nanak, for one who has such destiny written upon his forehead. ||2||
Pauree:
With every breath and morsel of food, chant the Name of the Lord, the Cherisher.
The Lord does not forget one upon whom He has bestowed His Grace.
He Himself is the Creator, and He Himself destroys.
