That Gurmukh, whom You have blessed with greatness - that humble being is known in Your True Court. ||11||
Shalok, Mardaanaa:
The Dark Age of Kali Yuga is the vessel, filled with the wine of sexual desire; the mind is the drunkard.
Anger is the cup, filled with emotional attachment, and egotism is the server.
Drinking too much in the company of falsehood and greed, one is ruined.
So let good deeds be your distillery, and Truth your molasses; in this way, make the most excellent wine of Truth.
Make virtue your bread, good conduct the ghee, and modesty the meat to eat.
As Gurmukh, these are obtained, O Nanak; partaking of them, one's sins depart. ||1||
Mardaanaa:
The human body is the vat, self-conceit is the wine, and desire is the company of drinking buddies.
The cup of the mind's longing is overflowing with falsehood, and the Messenger of Death is the cup-bearer.
Drinking in this wine, O Nanak, one takes on countless sins and corruptions.
So make spiritual wisdom your molasses, the Praise of God your bread, and the Fear of God the meat you eat.
O Nanak, this is the true food; let the True Name be your only Support. ||2||
If the human body is the vat, and self-realization is the wine, then a stream of Ambrosial Nectar is produced.
Meeting with the Society of the Saints, the cup of the Lord's Love is filled with this Ambrosial Nectar; drinking it in, one's corruptions and sins are wiped away. ||3||
Pauree:
He Himself is the angelic being, the heavenly herald, and the celestial singer. He Himself is the one who explains the six schools of philosophy.
He Himself is Shiva, Shankara and Mahaysh; He Himself is the Gurmukh, who speaks the Unspoken Speech.
He Himself is the Yogi, He Himself is the Sensual Enjoyer, and He Himself is the Sannyaasee, wandering through the wilderness.
He discusses with Himself, and He teaches Himself; He Himself is discrete, graceful and wise.
Staging His own play, He Himself watches it; He Himself is the Knower of all beings. ||12||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
That evening prayer alone is acceptable, which brings the Lord God to my consciousness.
Love for the Lord wells up within me, and my attachment to Maya is burnt away.
By Guru's Grace, duality is conquered, and the mind becomes stable; I have made contemplative meditation my evening prayer.
O Nanak, the self-willed manmukh may recite his evening prayers, but his mind is not centered on it; through birth and death, he is ruined. ||1||
Third Mehl:
I wandered over the whole world, crying out, "Love, O Love!", but my thirst was not quenched.
O Nanak, meeting the True Guru, my desires are satisfied; I found my Beloved, when I returned to my own home. ||2||
Pauree:
He Himself is the supreme essence, He Himself is the essence of all. He Himself is the Lord and Master, and He Himself is the servant.
He Himself created the people of the eighteen castes; God Himself acquired His domain.
He Himself kills, and He Himself redeems; He Himself, in His Kindness, forgives us. He is infallible -
He never errs; the justice of the True Lord is totally True.
Those whom the Lord Himself instructs as Gurmukh - duality and doubt depart from within them. ||13||
Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
That body, which does not remember the Lord's Name in meditation in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, shall be reduced to dust.
Cursed and insipid is that body, O Nanak, which does not know the One who created it. ||1||
