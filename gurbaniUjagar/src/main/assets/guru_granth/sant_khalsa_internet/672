When golden ornaments are melted down into a lump, they are still said to be gold. ||3||
The Divine Light has illuminated me, and I am filled with celestial peace and glory; the unstruck melody of the Lord's Bani resounds within me.
Says Nanak, I have built my eternal home; the Guru has constructed it for me. ||4||5||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
The desires of the greatest of the great kings and landlords cannot be satisfied.
They remain engrossed in Maya, intoxicated with the pleasures of their wealth; their eyes see nothing else at all. ||1||
No one has ever found satisfaction in sin and corruption.
The flame is not satisfied by more fuel; how can one be satisfied without the Lord? ||Pause||
Day after day, he eats his meals with many different foods, but his hunger is not eradicated.
He runs around like a dog, searching in the four directions. ||2||
The lustful, lecherous man desires many women, and he never stops peeking into the homes of others.
Day after day, he commits adultery again and again, and then he regrets his actions; he wastes away in misery and greed. ||3||
The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is incomparable and priceless; it is the treasure of Ambrosial Nectar.
The Saints abide in peace, poise and bliss; O Nanak, through the Guru, this is known. ||4||6||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
Nothing which this mortal being runs after, can compare to it.
He alone comes to have it, whom the Guru blesses with this Ambrosial Nectar. ||1||
One who comes to know the subtle essence of the One Lord,
for that person the desire to eat, to wear new clothes, and all other desires, do not abide in the mind. ||Pause||
The mind and body blossom forth in abundance, when one receives even a drop of this Nectar.
I cannot express His glory; I cannot describe His worth. ||2||
We cannot meet the Lord by our own efforts, nor can we meet Him through service; He comes and meets us spontaneously.
One who is blessed by my Lord Master's Grace, practices the Teachings of the Guru's Mantra. ||3||
He is merciful to the meek, always kind and compassionate; He cherishes and nurtures all beings.
The Lord is mingled with Nanak, through and through; He cherishes him, like the mother her child. ||4||7||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
I am a sacrifice to my Guru, who has implanted the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, within me.
In the utter darkness of the wilderness, He showed me the straight path. ||1||
The Lord of the universe, the Cherisher of the world, He is my breath of life.
Here and hereafter, he takes care of everything for me. ||1||Pause||
Meditating on Him in remembrance, I have found all treasures, respect, greatness and perfect honor.
Remembering His Name, millions of sins are erased; all His devotees long for the dust of His feet. ||2||
If someone wishes for the fulfillment of all his hopes and desires, he should serve the one supreme treasure.
He is the Supreme Lord God, infinite Lord and Master; meditating on Him in remembrance, one is carried across. ||3||
I have found total peace and tranquility in the Society of the Saints; my honor has been preserved.
To gather in the Lord's wealth, and to taste the food of the Lord's Name - Nanak has made this his feast. ||4||8||
