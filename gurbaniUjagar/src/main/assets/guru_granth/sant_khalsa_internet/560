As Gurmukh, O my mind, remember the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
It shall stand by you always, and go with you. ||Pause||
The True Lord is the social status and honor of the Gurmukh.
Within the Gurmukh, is God, his friend and helper. ||2||
He alone becomes Gurmukh, whom the Lord so blesses.
He Himself blesses the Gurmukh with greatness. ||3||
The Gurmukh lives the True Word of the Shabad, and practices good deeds.
The Gurmukh, O Nanak, emancipates his family and relations. ||4||6||
Wadahans, Third Mehl:
My tongue is intuitively attracted to the taste of the Lord.
My mind is satisfied, meditating on the Name of the Lord. ||1||
Lasting peace is obtained, contemplating the Shabad, the True Word of God.
I am forever a sacrifice to my True Guru. ||1||Pause||
My eyes are content, lovingly focused on the One Lord.
My mind is content, having forsaken the love of duality. ||2||
The frame of my body is at peace, through the Shabad, and the Name of the Lord.
The fragrance of the Naam permeates my heart. ||3||
O Nanak, one who has such great destiny written upon his forehead,
through the Bani of the Guru's Word, easily and intuitively becomes free of desire. ||4||7||
Wadahans, Third Mehl:
From the Perfect Guru, the Naam is obtained.
Through the Shabad, the True Word of God, one merges in the True Lord. ||1||
O my soul, obtain the treasure of the Naam,
by submitting to the Will of your Guru. ||1||Pause||
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, filth is washed away from within.
The Immaculate Naam comes to abide within the mind. ||2||
Deluded by doubt, the world wanders around.
It dies, and is born again, and is ruined by the Messenger of Death. ||3||
O Nanak, very fortunate are those who meditate on the Name of the Lord.
By Guru's Grace, they enshrine the Name within their minds. ||4||8||
Wadahans, Third Mehl:
Ego is opposed to the Name of the Lord; the two do not dwell in the same place.
In egotism, selfless service cannot be performed, and so the soul goes unfulfilled. ||1||
O my mind, think of the Lord, and practice the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
If you submit to the Hukam of the Lord's Command, then you shall meet with the Lord; only then will your ego depart from within. ||Pause||
Egotism is within all bodies; through egotism, we come to be born.
Egotism is total darkness; in egotism, no one can understand anything. ||2||
In egotism, devotional worship cannot be performed, and the Hukam of the Lord's Command cannot be understood.
In egotism, the soul is in bondage, and the Naam, the Name of the Lord, does not come to abide in the mind. ||3||
O Nanak, meeting with the True Guru, egotism is eliminated, and then, the True Lord comes to dwell in the mind||
One starts practicing truth, abides in truth and by serving the True One gets absorbed in Him. ||4||9||12||
Wadahans, Fourth Mehl, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
There is one bed, and One Lord God.
The Gurmukh enjoys the Lord, the ocean of peace. ||1||
My mind longs to meet my Beloved Lord.
