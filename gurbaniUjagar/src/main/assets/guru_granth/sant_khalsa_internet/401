I am a sacrifice to the Guru; meeting Him, I am absorbed into the True Lord. ||1||Pause||
Good omens and bad omens affect those who do not keep the Lord in the mind.
The Messenger of Death does not approach those who are pleasing to the Lord God. ||2||
Donations to charity, meditation and penance - above all of them is the Naam.
One who chants with his tongue the Name of the Lord, Har, Har - his works are brought to perfect completion. ||3||
His fears are removed, and his doubts and attachments are gone; he sees none other than God.
O Nanak, the Supreme Lord God preserves him, and no pain or sorrow afflicts him any longer. ||4||18||120||
Aasaa, Ninth House, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Contemplating Him within my consciousness, I obtain total peace; but hereafter, will I be pleasing to Him or not?
There is only One Giver; all others are beggars. Who else can we turn to? ||1||
When I beg from others, I am ashamed.
The One Lord Master is the Supreme King of all; who else is equal to Him? ||1||Pause||
Standing up and sitting down, I cannot live without Him. I search and search for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan.
Even Brahma and the sages Sanak, Sanandan, Sanaatan and Sanat Kumar, find it difficult to obtain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. ||2||
He is unapproachable and unfathomable; His wisdom is deep and profound; His value cannot be appraised.
I have taken to the Sanctuary of the True Lord, the Primal Being, and I meditate on the True Guru. ||3||
God, the Lord Master, has become kind and compassionate; He has cut the noose of death away from my neck.
Says Nanak, now that I have obtained the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I shall not have to be reincarnated again. ||4||1||121||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Inwardly, I sing His Praises, and outwardly, I sing His Praises; I sing His Praises while awake and asleep.
I am a trader in the Name of the Lord of the Universe; He has given it to me as my supplies, to carry with me. ||1||
I have forgotten and forsaken other things.
The Perfect Guru has given me the Gift of the Naam; this alone is my Support. ||1||Pause||
I sing His Praises while suffering, and I sing His Praises while I am at peace as well. I contemplate Him while I walk along the Path.
The Guru has implanted the Naam within my mind, and my thirst has been quenched. ||2||
I sing His Praises during the day, and I sing His Praises during the night; I sing them with each and every breath.
In the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, this faith is established, that the Lord is with us, in life and in death. ||3||
Bless servant Nanak with this gift, O God, that he may obtain, and enshrine in his heart, the dust of the feet of the Saints.
Hear the Lord's Sermon with your ears, and behold the Blessed Vision of His Darshan with your eyes; place your forehead upon the Guru's Feet. ||4||2||122||

Aasaa, Tenth House, Fifth Mehl:
That which you believe to be permanent, is a guest here for only a few days.
