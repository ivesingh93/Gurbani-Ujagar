The humble Saints, the Saints of the Lord, are noble and sublime; meeting them, the mind is tinged with love and joy.
The Lord's Love never fades away, and it never wears off. Through the Lord's Love, one goes and meets the Lord, Har, Har. ||3||
I am a sinner; I have committed so many sins. The Guru has cut them, cut them, and hacked them off.
The Guru has placed the healing remedy of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, into my mouth. Servant Nanak, the sinner, has been purified and sanctified. ||4||5||
Kaanraa, Fourth Mehl:
Chant, O my mind, the Name of the Lord, the Lord of the Universe.
I was caught in the whirlpool of poisonous sin and corruption. The True Guru gave me His Hand; He lifted me up and pulled me out. ||1||Pause||
O my Fearless, Immaculate Lord and Master, please save me - I am a sinner, a sinking stone.
I am lured and enticed by sexual desire, anger, greed and corruption, but associating with You, I am carried across, like iron in the wooden boat. ||1||
You are the Great Primal Being, the most Inaccessible and Unfathomable Lord God; I search for You, but cannot find Your depth.
You are the farthest of the far, beyond the beyond, O my Lord and Master; You alone know Yourself, O Lord of the Universe. ||2||
I meditate on the Name of the Unseen and Unfathomable Lord; joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, I have found the Path of the Holy.
Joining the congregation, I listen to the Gospel of the Lord, Har, Har; I meditate on the Lord, Har, Har, and speak the Unspoken Speech. ||3||
My God is the Lord of the World, the Lord of the Universe; please save me, O Lord of all Creation.
Servant Nanak is the slave of the slave of Your slaves. O God, please bless me with Your Grace; please protect me and keep me with Your humble servants. ||4||6||
Kaanraa, Fourth Mehl, Partaal, Fifth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O mind, meditate on the Lord, the Lord of the World.
The Lord is the Jewel, the Diamond, the RÃ¼by.
The Lord fashions the Gurmukhs in His Mint.
O Lord, please, please, be Merciful to me. ||1||Pause||
Your Glorious Virtues are inaccessible and unfathomable; how can my one poor tongue describe them? O my Beloved Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam, Raam.
O Dear Lord, You, You, You alone know Your Unspoken Speech. I have become enraptured, enraptured, enraptured, meditating on the Lord. ||1||
The Lord, my Lord and Master, is my Companion and my Breath of Life; the Lord is my Best Friend. My mind, body and tongue are attuned to the Lord, Har, Haray, Haray. The Lord is my Wealth and Property.
She alone obtains her Husband Lord, who is so pre-destined. Through the Guru's Teachings, she sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, Har, Har, Haray, Haray. I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to the Lord, O servant Nanak. Meditating on the Lord, I have become enraptured, enraptured, enraptured. ||2||1||7||
Kaanraa, Fourth Mehl:
Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, the Lord of the Universe.
Let my one tongue become two hundred thousand
NAME?
O Lord, please, please, be Merciful to me. ||1||Pause||
O Lord, my Lord and Master, please be Merciful to me; please enjoin me to serve You. I chant and meditate on the Lord, I chant and meditate on the Lord, I chant and meditate on the Lord of the Universe.
Your humble servants chant and meditate on You, O Lord; they are sublime and exalted. I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice to them. ||1||
