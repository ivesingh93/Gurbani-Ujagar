The Lord Himself sent His Holy Saints, to tell us that He is not far away.
O Nanak, doubt and fear are dispelled, chanting the Name of the all-pervading Lord. ||2||
Chhant:
In the cold season of Maghar and Poh, the Lord reveals Himself.
My burning desires were quenched, when I obtained the Blessed Vision of His Darshan; the fraudulent illusion of Maya is gone.
All my desires have been fulfilled, meeting the Lord face-to-face; I am His servant, I serve at His feet.
My necklaces, hair-ties, all decorations and adornments, are in singing the Glorious Praises of the unseen, mysterious Lord.
I long for loving devotion to the Lord of the Universe, and so the Messenger of Death cannot even see me.
Prays Nanak, God has united me with Himself; I shall never suffer separation from my Beloved again. ||6||
Shalok:
The happy soul bride has found the wealth of the Lord; her consciousness does not waver.
Joining together with the Saints, O Nanak, God, my Friend, has revealed Himself in my home. ||1||
With her Beloved Husband Lord, she enjoys millions of melodies, pleasures and joys.
The fruits of the mind's desires are obtained, O Nanak, chanting the Lord's Name. ||2||
Chhant:
The snowy winter season, the months of Maagh and Phagun, are pleasing and ennobling to the mind.
O my friends and companions, sing the songs of joy; my Husband Lord has come into my home.
My Beloved has come into my home; I meditate on Him in my mind. The bed of my heart is beautifully adorned.
The woods, the meadows and the three worlds have blossomed forth in their greenery; gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, I am fascinated.
I have met my Lord and Master, and my desires are fulfilled; my mind chants His Immaculate Mantra.
Prays Nanak, I celebrate continuously; I have met my Husband Lord, the Lord of excellence. ||7||
Shalok:
The Saints are the helpers, the support of the soul; they carry us cross the terrifying world-ocean.
Know that they are the highest of all; O Nanak, they love the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||
Those who know Him, cross over; they are the brave heroes, the heroic warriors.
Nanak is a sacrifice to those who meditate on the Lord, and cross over to the other shore. ||2||
Chhant:
His feet are exalted above all. They eradicate all suffering.
They destroy the pains of coming and going. They bring loving devotion to the Lord.
Imbued with the Lord's Love, one is intoxicated with intuitive peace and poise, and does not forget the Lord from his mind, even for an instant.
Shedding my self-conceit, I have entered the Sanctuary of His Feet; all virtues rest in the Lord of the Universe.
I bow in humility to the Lord of the Universe, the treasure of virtue, the Lord of excellence, our Primal Lord and Master.
Prays Nanak, shower me with Your Mercy, Lord; throughout the ages, You take the same form. ||8||1||6||8||
