The infinite substance is within it.
Within it, the great merchant is said to dwell.
Who is the trader who deals there? ||1||
How rare is that trader who deals in the jewel of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
He takes the Ambrosial Nectar as his food. ||1||Pause||
He dedicates his mind and body to serving the Lord.
How can we please the Lord?
I fall at His Feet, and I renounce all sense of 'mine and yours'.
Who can settle this bargain? ||2||
How can I attain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence?
How can I get Him to call me inside?
You are the Great Merchant; You have millions of traders.
Who is the benefactor? Who can take me to Him? ||3||
Seeking and searching, I have found my own home, deep within my own being.
The True Lord has shown me the priceless jewel.
When the Great Merchant shows His Mercy, He blends us into Himself.
Says Nanak, place your faith in the Guru. ||4||16||85||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl, Gwaarayree:
Night and day, they remain in the Love of the One.
They know that God is always with them.
They make the Name of their Lord and Master their way of life;
they are satisfied and fulfilled with the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan. ||1||
Imbued with the Love of the Lord, their minds and bodies are rejuvenated,
entering the Sanctuary of the Perfect Guru. ||1||Pause||
The Lord's Lotus Feet are the Support of the soul.
They see only the One, and obey His Order.
There is only one trade, and one occupation.
They know no other than the Formless Lord. ||2||
They are free of both pleasure and pain.
They remain unattached, joined to the Lord's Way.
They are seen among all, and yet they are distinct from all.
They focus their meditation on the Supreme Lord God. ||3||
How can I describe the Glories of the Saints?
Their knowledge is unfathomable; their limits cannot be known.
O Supreme Lord God, please shower Your Mercy upon me.
Bless Nanak with the dust of the feet of the Saints. ||4||17||86||
Gauree Gwaarayree, Fifth Mehl:
You are my Companion; You are my Best Friend.
You are my Beloved; I am in love with You.
You are my honor; You are my decoration.
Without You, I cannot survive, even for an instant. ||1||
You are my Intimate Beloved, You are my breath of life.
You are my Lord and Master; You are my Leader. ||1||Pause||
As You keep me, so do I survive.
Whatever You say, that is what I do.
Wherever I look, there I see You dwelling.
O my Fearless Lord, with my tongue, I chant Your Name. ||2||
You are my nine treasures, You are my storehouse.
I am imbued with Your Love; You are the Support of my mind.
You are my Glory; I am blended with You.
You are my Shelter; You are my Anchoring Support. ||3||
Deep within my mind and body, I meditate on You.
I have obtained Your secret from the Guru.
Through the True Guru, the One and only Lord was implanted within me;
servant Nanak has taken to the Support of the Lord, Har, Har, Har. ||4||18||87||
