you shall have to leave it all behind.
These things seem like only a dream,
to one who takes the Lord's Name. ||1||
Forsaking the Lord, and clinging to another,
they run toward death and reincarnation.
But those humble beings, who attach themselves to the Lord, Har, Har,
continue to live.
One who is blessed with the Lord's Mercy,
O Nanak, becomes His devotee. ||2||7||163||232||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Raag Aasaa, Ninth Mehl:
Who should I tell the condition of the mind?
Engrossed in greed, running around in the ten directions, you hold to your hopes of wealth. ||1||Pause||
For the sake of pleasure, you suffer such great pain, and you have to serve each and every person.
You wander from door to door like a dog, unconscious of the Lord's meditation. ||1||
You lose this human life in vain, and You are not even ashamed when others laugh at you.
O Nanak, why not sing the Lord's Praises, so that you may be rid of the body's evil disposition? ||2||1||233||
Raag Aasaa, First Mehl, Ashtapadees, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
He descends the treacherous precipice, to bathe in the cleansing pool;
without speaking or saying anything, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
Like water vapor in the sky, he remains absorbed in the Lord.
He churns the true pleasures to obtain the supreme nectar. ||1||
Listen to such spiritual wisdom, O my mind.
The Lord is totally pervading and permeating all places. ||1||Pause||
One who makes Truthfulness his fast and religious vows, does not suffer the pain of death.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he burns away his anger.
He dwells in the Tenth Gate, immersed in the Samaadhi of deep meditation.
Touching the philosopher's stone, he obtains the supreme status. ||2||
For the benefit of the mind, churn the true essence of reality;
bathing in the over-flowing tank of nectar, filth is washed away.
We become like the One with whom we are imbued.
Whatever the Creator does, comes to pass. ||3||
The Guru is cool and soothing like ice; He puts out the fire of the mind.
Smear your body with the ashes of dedicated service,
and live in the home of peace - make this your religious order.
Let the Immaculate Bani of the Word be your playing of the flute. ||4||
Spiritual wisdom within is the supreme, sublime nectar.
Contemplation of the Guru is one's bathing at holy places of pilgrimage.
Worship and adoration within is the Lord's dwelling.
He is the One who blends one's light with the Divine Light. ||5||
He delights in the delightful wisdom of loving the One Lord.
He is one of the self-elect - he merges with the Lord, who occupies the throne.
He performs his works in obedience to the Will of his Lord and Master.
The Unknowable Lord cannot be understood. ||6||
The lotus originates in the water, and yet it remains distinct from the water.
Just so, the Divine Light pervades and permeates the water of the world.
Who is near, and who is far away?
I sing the Glories of the Lord, the treasure of virtue; I behold Him ever-present. ||7||
Inwardly and outwardly, there is none other than Him.
