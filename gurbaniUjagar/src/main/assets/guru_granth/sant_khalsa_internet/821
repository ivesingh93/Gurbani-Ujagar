I am satisfied and satiated, gazing upon the Blessed Vision of God's Darshan. I eat the Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord's sublime food.
Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of Your Feet, O God; in Your Mercy, unite him with the Society of the Saints. ||2||4||84||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
He Himself has saved His humble servant.
In His Mercy, the Lord, Har, Har, has blessed me with His Name, and all my pains and afflictions have been dispelled. ||1||Pause||
Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe, all you humble servants of the Lord; chant the jewels, the songs of the Lord with your tongue.
The desires of millions of incarnations shall be quenched, and your soul shall be satisfied with the sweet, sublime essence of the Lord. ||1||
I have grasped the Sanctuary of the Lord's Feet; He is the Giver of peace; through the Word of the Guru's Teachings, I meditate and chant the Chant of the Lord.
I have crossed over the world-ocean, and my doubt and fear are dispelled, says Nanak, through the glorious grandeur of our Lord and Master. ||2||5||85||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Through the Guru, the Creator Lord has subdued the fever.
I am a sacrifice to my True Guru, who has saved the honor of the whole world. ||1||Pause||
Placing His Hand on the child's forehead, He saved him.
God blessed me with the supreme, sublime essence of the Ambrosial Naam. ||1||
The Merciful Lord saves the honor of His slave.
Guru Nanak speaks - it is confirmed in the Court of the Lord. ||2||6||86||
Raag Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl, Chau-Padas And Du-Padas, Seventh House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The Shabad, the Word of the True Guru, is the light of the lamp.
It dispels the darkness from the body-mansion, and opens the beautiful chamber of jewels. ||1||Pause||
I was wonderstruck and astonished, when I looked inside; I cannot even describe its glory and grandeur.
I am intoxicated and enraptured with it, and I am wrapped in it, through and through. ||1||
No worldly entanglements or snares can trap me, and no trace of egotistical pride remains.
You are the highest of the high, and no curtain separates us; I am Yours, and You are mine. ||2||
The One Creator Lord created the expanse of the one universe; the One Lord is unlimited and infinite.
The One Lord pervades the one universe; the One Lord is totally permeating everywhere; the One Lord is the Support of the breath of life. ||3||
He is the most immaculate of the immaculate, the purest of the pure, so pure, so pure.
He has no end or limitation; He is forever unlimited. Says Nanak, He is the highest of the high. ||4||1||87||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Without the Lord, nothing is of any use.
You are totally attached to that Enticer Maya; she is enticing you. ||1||Pause||
You shall have to leave behind your gold, your woman and your beautiful bed; you shall have to depart in an instant.
You are entangled in the lures of sexual pleasures, and you are eating poisonous drugs. ||1||
You have built and adorned a palace of straw, and under it, you light a fire.
Sitting all puffed-up in such a castle, you stubborn-minded fool, what do you think you will gain? ||2||
The five thieves stand over your head and seize you. Grabbing you by your hair, they will drive you on.
