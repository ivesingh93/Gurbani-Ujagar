Saarang, Fourth Mehl, Partaal:
O my mind, meditate on the Lord of the Universe, the Lord, the Lord of the Universe, the Treasure of Virtue, the God of all creation. O my mind, chant the Name of the Lord, the Lord, the Eternal, Imperishable, Primal Lord God. ||1||Pause||
The Name of the Lord is the Ambrosial Nectar, Har, Har, Har. He alone drinks it in, whom the Lord inspires to drink it.
The Merciful Lord Himself bestows His Mercy, and He leads the mortal to meet with the True Guru. That humble being tastes the Ambrosial Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||
Those who serve my Lord, forever and ever - all their pain, doubt and fear are taken away.
Servant Nanak chants the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and so he lives, like the song-bird, which is satisfied only by drinking in the water. ||2||5||12||
Saarang, Fourth Mehl:
O my mind, meditate on the Supreme Lord.
The Lord, the Lord is All-pervading.
True, True is the Lord.
O Siblings of Destiny, chant the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam, forever. He is All-pervading everywhere. ||1||Pause||
The Lord Himself is Himself the Creator of all. The Lord Himself is Himself pervading the whole world.
That person, upon whom my Sovereign Lord King, Raam, Raam, Raam, bestows His Mercy - that person is lovingly attuned to the Lord's Name. ||1||
O Saints of the Lord, behold the Glory of the Name of the Lord; His Name saves the honor of His humble devotees in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga.
My Sovereign Lord King has taken servant Nanak's side; his enemies and attackers have all run away. ||2||6||13||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl, Chau-Padas, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
I am a sacrifice to the Image of the True Guru.
My inner being is filled with a great thirst, like that of the song-bird for water. When shall I find the Fruitful Vision of His Darshan? ||1||Pause||
He is the Master of the masterless, the Cherisher of all. He is the Lover of the devotees of His Name.
That mortal, whom no one can protect - You bless him with Your Support, O Lord. ||1||
Support of the unsupported, Saving Grace of the unsaved, Home of the homeless.
Wherever I go in the ten directions, You are there with me. The only thing I do is sing the Kirtan of Your Praises. ||2||
From Your Oneness, You become tens of thousands, and from tens of thousands, You become One. I cannot describe Your state and extent.
You are Infinite - Your value cannot be appraised. Everything I see is Your play. ||3||
I speak with the Company of the Holy; I am in love with the Holy people of the Lord.
Servant Nanak has found the Lord through the Guru's Teachings; please bless me with Your Blessed Vision; O Lord, my mind yearns for it. ||4||1||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
The Dear Lord is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.
The mortal does evil deeds, and hides from others, but like the air, the Lord is present everywhere. ||1||Pause||
You call yourself a devotee of Vishnu and you practice the six rituals, but your inner being is polluted with greed.
Those who slander the Society of the Saints, shall all be drowned in their ignorance. ||1||
