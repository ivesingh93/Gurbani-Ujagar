In the Society of the Saints, spiritual conversations take place.
The sinful mistakes of millions of incarnations are erased. ||2||
The Holy Saints meditate in remembrance, in ecstasy.
Their minds and bodies are immersed in supreme ecstasy. ||3||
Who have obtained the treasure of the Lord's Feet,
slave Nanak is a sacrifice to those. ||4||95||164||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Do only that, by which no filth or pollution shall stick to you.
Let your mind remain awake and aware, singing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises. ||1||Pause||
Meditate in remembrance on the One Lord; do not be in love with duality.
In the Society of the Saints, chant only the Name. ||1||
The karma of good actions, the Dharma of righteous living, religious rituals, fasts and worship -
practice these, but do not know any other than the Supreme Lord God. ||2||
The works are brought to fruition,
who place their love in God. ||3||
Infinitely invaluable is that Vaishnaav, that worshipper of Vishnu,
says Nanak, who has renounced corruption. ||4||96||165||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
They desert you even when you are alive, O madman;
what good can they do when someone is dead? ||1||
Meditate in remembrance on the Lord of the Universe in your mind and body - this is your pre-ordained destiny.
The poison of Maya is of no use at all. ||1||Pause||
Those who have eaten this poison of deception -
their thirst shall never depart. ||2||
The treacherous world-ocean is filled with terrible pain.
Without the Lord's Name, how can anyone cross over? ||3||
Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, you shall be saved here and hereafter.
O Nanak, worship and adore the Name of the Lord. ||4||97||166||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
The bearded emperor who struck down the poor,
has been burnt in the fire by the Supreme Lord God. ||1||
The Creator administers true justice.
He is the Saving Grace of His slaves. ||1||Pause||
In the beginning, and throughout the ages, His glory is manifest.
The slanderer died after contracting the deadly fever. ||2||
He is killed, and no one can save him.
Here and hereafter, his reputation is evil. ||3||
The Lord hugs His slaves close in His Embrace.
Nanak seeks the Lord's Sanctuary, and meditates on the Naam. ||4||98||167||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
The memorandum was proven to be false by the Lord Himself.
The sinner is now suffering in despair. ||1||
Those who have my Lord of the Universe as their support -
death does not even approach them. ||1||Pause||
In the True Court, they lie;
the blind fools strike their own heads with their own hands. ||2||
Sickness afflicts those who commit sins;
God Himself sits as the Judge. ||3||
By their own actions, they are bound and gagged.
All their wealth is gone, along with their lives. ||4||
Nanak has taken to the Sanctuary of the Lord's Court;
my Creator has preserved my honor. ||5||99||168||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
The dust of the feet of the humble beings is so sweet to my mind.
Perfect karma is the mortal's pre-ordained destiny. ||1||Pause||
