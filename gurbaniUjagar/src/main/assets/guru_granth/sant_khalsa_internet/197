Taking my cleansing bath in the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, I have been purified.
Its reward surpasses the giving of charity at millions of solar eclipses. ||1||Pause||
With the Lord's Feet abiding in the heart,
the sinful mistakes of countless incarnations are removed. ||1||

If God, the Destroyer of fear, does not dwell within your mind,
you shall spend countless incarnations in fear and dread. ||1||Pause||

have all their desires and tasks fulfilled. ||2||
Birth, old age and death are in His Power,
so remember that All-powerful Lord with each breath and morsel of food. ||3||

Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Blessed is this place, where the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe are sung.
God Himself bestows peace and pleasure. ||1||Pause||

There are millions of joys where the Glorious Praises of the Lord are sung. ||1||
Forgetting the Lord, all sorts of pains and diseases come.
Serving God, the Messenger of Death will not even approach you. ||2||
Very blessed, stable and sublime is that place,
where the Name of God alone is chanted. ||3||
Wherever I go, my Lord and Master is with me.
Nanak has met the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. ||4||89||158||

That mortal who meditates on the Lord of the Universe,
whether educated or uneducated, obtains the state of supreme dignity. ||1||
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, meditate on the Lord of the World.
Without the Name, wealth and property are false. ||1||Pause||
