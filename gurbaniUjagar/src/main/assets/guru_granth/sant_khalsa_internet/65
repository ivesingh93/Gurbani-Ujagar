Serving the True Guru, I have found the Treasure of Excellence. Its value cannot be estimated.
The Dear Lord God is my Best Friend. In the end, He shall be my Companion and Support. ||3||
In this world of my father's home, the Great Giver is the Life of the World. The self-willed manmukhs have lost their honor.
Without the True Guru, no one knows the Way. The blind find no place of rest.
If the Lord, the Giver of Peace, does not dwell within the mind, then they shall depart with regret in the end. ||4||
In this world of my father's house, through the Guru's Teachings, I have cultivated within my mind the Great Giver, the Life of the World.
Night and day, performing devotional worship, day and night, ego and emotional attachment are removed.
And then, attuned to Him, we become like Him, truly absorbed in the True One. ||5||
Bestowing His Glance of Grace, He gives us His Love, and we contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Serving the True Guru, intuitive peace wells up, and ego and desire die.
The Lord, the Giver of Virtue, dwells forever within the minds of those who keep Truth enshrined within their hearts. ||6||
My God is forever Immaculate and Pure; with a pure mind, He can be found.
If the Treasure of the Name of the Lord abides within the mind, egotism and pain are totally eliminated.
The True Guru has instructed me in the Word of the Shabad. I am forever a sacrifice to Him. ||7||
Within your own conscious mind, you may say anything, but without the Guru, selfishness and conceit are not eradicated.
The Dear Lord is the Lover of His devotees, the Giver of Peace. By His Grace, He abides within the mind.
O Nanak, God blesses us with the sublime awakening of consciousness; He Himself grants glorious greatness to the Gurmukh. ||8||1||18||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Those who go around acting in egotism are struck down by the Messenger of Death with his club.
Those who serve the True Guru are uplifted and saved, in love with the Lord. ||1||
O mind, become Gurmukh, and meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Those who are so pre-destined by the Creator are absorbed into the Naam, through the Guru's Teachings. ||1||Pause||
Without the True Guru, faith does not come, and love for the Naam is not embraced.
Even in dreams, they find no peace; they sleep immersed in pain. ||2||
Even if you chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, with great longing, your past actions are still not erased.
The Lord's devotees surrender to His Will; those devotees are accepted at His Door. ||3||
The Guru has lovingly implanted the Word of His Shabad within me. Without His Grace, it cannot be attained.
Even if the poisonous plant is watered with ambrosial nectar a hundred times, it will still bear poisonous fruit. ||4||
Those humble beings who are in love with the True Guru are pure and true.
They act in harmony with the Will of the True Guru; they shed the poison of ego and corruption. ||5||
Acting in stubborn-mindedness, no one is saved; go and study the Simritees and the Shaastras.
Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and practicing the Shabads of the Guru, you shall be saved. ||6||
The Name of the Lord is the Treasure, which has no end or limitation.
The Gurmukhs are beauteous; the Creator has blessed them with His Mercy. ||7||
O Nanak, the One Lord alone is the Giver; there is no other at all.
By Guru's Grace, He is obtained. By His Mercy, He is found. ||8||2||19||
