The All-pervading Sovereign Lord King is contained in each and every heart. Through the Guru, and the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I am lovingly centered on the Lord.
Cutting my mind and body into pieces, I offer them to my Guru. The Guru's Teachings have dispelled my doubt and fear. ||2||
In the darkness, the Guru has lit the lamp of the Guru's wisdom; I am lovingly focused on the Lord.
The darkness of ignorance has been dispelled, and my mind has been awakened; within the home of my inner being, I have found the genuine article. ||3||
The vicious hunters, the faithless cynics, are hunted down by the Messenger of Death.
They have not sold their heads to the True Guru; those wretched, unfortunate ones continue coming and going in reincarnation. ||4||
Hear my prayer, O God, my Lord and Master: I beg for the Sanctuary of the Lord God.
Servant Nanak's honor and respect is the Guru; he has sold his head to the True Guru. ||5||10||24||62||
Gauree Poorbee, Fourth Mehl:
I am egotistical and conceited, and my intellect is ignorant. Meeting the Guru, my selfishness and conceit have been abolished.
The illness of egotism is gone, and I have found peace. Blessed, blessed is the Guru, the Sovereign Lord King. ||1||
I have found the Lord, through the Teachings of the Guru. ||1||Pause||
My heart is filled with love for the Sovereign Lord King; the Guru has shown me the path and the way to find Him.
My soul and body all belong to the Guru; I was separated, and He has led me into the Lord's Embrace. ||2||
Deep within myself, I would love to see the Lord; the Guru has inspired me to see Him within my heart.
Within my mind, intuitive peace and bliss have arisen; I have sold myself to the Guru. ||3||
I am a sinner - I have committed so many sins; I am a villainous, thieving thief.
Now, Nanak has come to the Lord's Sanctuary; preserve my honor, Lord, as it pleases Your Will. ||4||11||25||63||
Gauree Poorbee, Fourth Mehl:
Through the Guru's Teachings, the unstruck music resounds; through the Guru's Teachings, the mind sings.
By great good fortune, I received the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan. Blessed, blessed is the Guru, who has led me to love the Lord. ||1||
The Gurmukh is lovingly centered on the Lord. ||1||Pause||
My Lord and Master is the Perfect True Guru. My mind works to serve the Guru.
I massage and wash the Feet of the Guru, who recites the Sermon of the Lord. ||2||
The Teachings of the Guru are in my heart; the Lord is the Source of nectar. My tongue sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
My mind is immersed in, and drenched with the Lord's essence. Fulfilled with the Lord's Love, I shall never feel hunger again. ||3||
People try all sorts of things, but without the Lord's Mercy, His Name is not obtained.
The Lord has showered His Mercy upon servant Nanak; through the wisdom of the Guru's Teachings, he has enshrined the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||12||26||64||
Raag Gauree Maajh, Fourth Mehl:
O my soul, as Gurmukh, do this deed: chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Make that teaching your mother, that it may teach you to keep the Lord's Name in your mouth.
Let contentment be your father; the Guru is the Primal Being, beyond birth or incarnation.
