Prays Nanak, please, give me Your Hand and save me, O Lord of the Universe, Merciful to the meek. ||4||
That day is judged to be fruitful, when I merged with my Lord.
Total happiness was revealed, and pain was taken far away.
Peace, tranquility, joy and eternal happiness come from constantly singing the Glorious Praises of the Sustainer of the World.
Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I lovingly remember the Lord; I shall not wander again in reincarnation.
He has naturally hugged me close in His Loving Embrace, and the seed of my primal destiny has sprouted.
Prays Nanak, He Himself has met me, and He shall never again leave me. ||5||4||7||
Bihaagraa, Fifth Mehl, Chhant:
Listen to my prayer, O my Lord and Master.
I am filled with millions of sins, but still, I am Your slave.
O Destroyer of pain, Bestower of Mercy, Fascinating Lord, Destroyer of sorrow and strife,
I have come to Your Sanctuary; please preserve my honor. You are all-pervading, O Immaculate Lord.
He hears and beholds all; God is with us, the nearest of the near.
O Lord and Master, hear Nanak's prayer; please save the servants of Your household. ||1||
You are eternal and all-powerful; I am a mere beggar, Lord.
I am intoxicated with the love of Maya - save me, Lord!
Bound down by greed, emotional attachment and corruption, I have made so many mistakes.
The creator is both attached and detached from entanglements; one obtains the fruits of his own actions.
Show kindness to me, O Purifier of sinners; I am so tired of wandering through reincarnation.
Prays Nanak, I am the slave of the Lord; God is the Support of my soul, and my breath of life. ||2||
You are great and all-powerful; my understanding is so inadequate, O Lord.
You cherish even the ungrateful ones; Your Glance of Grace is perfect, Lord.
Your wisdom is unfathomable, O Infinite Creator. I am lowly, and I know nothing.
Forsaking the jewel, I have saved the shell; I am a lowly, ignorant beast.
I have kept that which forsakes me, and is very fickle, continually committing sins, again and again.
Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary, Almighty Lord and Master; please, preserve my honor. ||3||
I was separated from Him, and now, He has united me with Himself.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
Singing the Praises of the Lord of the Universe, the ever-sublime blissful Lord is revealed to me.
My bed is adorned with God; my God has made me His own.
Abandoning anxiety, I have become carefree, and I shall not suffer in pain any longer.
Nanak lives by beholding the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe, the ocean of excellence. ||4||5||8||
Bihaagraa, Fifth Mehl, Chhant:
O you of sublime faith, chant the Lord's Name; why do you remain silent?
with your eyes, you have seen the treacherous ways of Maya.
Nothing shall go along with you, except the Name of the Lord of the Universe.
Land, clothes, gold and silver - all of these things are useless.
Children, spouse, worldly honors, elephants, horses and other corrupting influences shall not go with you.
Prays Nanak, without the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the whole world is false. ||1||
