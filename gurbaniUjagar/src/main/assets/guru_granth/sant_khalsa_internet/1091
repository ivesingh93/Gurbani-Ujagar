The Fear of God abides in the mind of the innocent; this is the straight path to the One Lord.
Jealousy and envy bring terrible pain, and one is cursed throughout the three worlds. ||1||
First Mehl:
The drum of the Vedas vibrates, bringing dispute and divisiveness.
O Nanak, contemplate the Naam, the Name of the Lord; there is none except Him. ||2||
First Mehl:
The world-ocean of the three qualities is unfathomably deep; how can its bottom be seen?
If I meet with the great, self-sufficient True Guru, then I am carried across.
This ocean is filled up with pain and suffering.
O Nanak, without the True Name, no one's hunger is appeased. ||3||
Pauree:
Those who search their inner beings, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, are exalted and adorned.
They obtain what they wish for, meditating on the Lord's Name.
One who is blessed by God's Grace, meets with the Guru; he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
The Righteous Judge of Dharma is his friend; he does not have to walk on the Path of Death.
He meditates on the Lord's Name, day and night; he is absorbed and immersed in the Lord's Name. ||14||
Shalok, First Mehl:
Listen to and speak the Name of the One Lord, who permeates the heavens, this world and the nether regions of the underworld.
The Hukam of His Command cannot be erased; whatever He has written, shall go with the mortal.
Who has died, and who kills? Who comes and who goes?
Who is enraptured, O Nanak, and whose consciousness merges in the Lord? ||1||
First Mehl:
In egotism, he dies; possessiveness kills him, and the breath flows out like a river.
Desire is exhausted, O Nanak, only when the mind is imbued with the Name.
His eyes are imbued with the eyes of the Lord, and his ears ring with celestial consciousness.
His tongue drinks in the sweet nectar, dyed crimson by chanting the Name of the Beloved Lord.
His inner being is drenched with the Lord's fragrance; his worth cannot be described. ||2||
Pauree:
In this age, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the treasure. Only the Naam goes along in the end.
It is inexhaustible; it is never empty, no matter how much one may eat, consume or spend.
The Messenger of Death does not even approach the humble servant of the Lord.
They alone are the true bankers and traders, who have the wealth of the Lord in their laps.
By the Lord's Mercy, one finds the Lord, only when the Lord Himself sends for him. ||15||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
The self-willed manmukh does not appreciate the excellence of trading in Truth. He deals in poison, collects poison, and is in love with poison.
Outwardly, they call themselves Pandits, religious scholars, but in their minds they are foolish and ignorant.
They do not focus their consciousness on the Lord; they love to engage in arguments.
They speak to cause arguments, and earn their living by telling lies.
In this world, only the Lord's Name is immaculate and pure. All other objects of creation are polluted.
O Nanak, those who do not remember the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are polluted; they dIE in ignorance. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Without serving the Lord, he suffers in pain; accepting the Hukam of God's Command, pain is gone.
He Himself is the Giver of peace; He Himself awards punishment.
O Nanak, know this well; all that happens is according to His Will. ||2||
Pauree:
Without the Lord's Name, the world is poor. Without the Name, no one is satisfied.
He is deluded by duality and doubt. In egotism, he suffers in pain.
