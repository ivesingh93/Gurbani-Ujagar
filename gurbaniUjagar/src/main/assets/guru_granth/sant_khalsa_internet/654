You Yourself created the world, and You Yourself shall destroy it in the end.
The Word of Your Shabad alone is pervading everywhere; whatever You do, comes to pass.
God blesses the Gurmukh with glorious greatness, and then, he finds the Lord.
As Gurmukh, Nanak worships and adores the Lord; let everyone proclaim, "Blessed, blessed, blessed is He, the Guru!"||29||1||Sudh||
Raag Sorat'h, The Word Of Devotee Kabeer Jee, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Worshipping their idols, the Hindus die; the Muslims dIE bowing their heads.
The Hindus cremate their dead, while the Muslims bury theirs; neither finds Your true state, Lord. ||1||
O mind, the world is a deep, dark pit.
On all four sides, Death has spread his net. ||1||Pause||
Reciting their poems, the poets die; the mystical ascetics dIE while journeying to Kaydaar Naat'h.
The Yogis die, with their matted hair, but even they do not find Your state, Lord. ||2||
The kings die, gathering and hoarding their money, burying great quantities of gold.
The Pandits die, reading and reciting the Vedas; women die, gazing at their own beauty. ||3||
Without the Lord's Name, all come to ruin; behold, and know this, O body.
Without the Name of the Lord, who can find salvation? Kabeer speaks the Teachings. ||4||1||
When the body is burnt, it turns to ashes; if it is not cremated, then it is eaten by armies of worms.
The unbaked clay pitcher dissolves, when water is poured into it; this is also the nature of the body. ||1||
Why, O Siblings of Destiny, do you strut around, all puffed up with pride?
Have you forgotten those days, when you were hanging, face down, for ten months? ||1||Pause||
Like the bee which collects honey, the fool eagerly gathers and collects wealth.
At the time of death, they shout, "Take him away, take him away! Why leave a ghost lying around?" ||2||
His wife accompanies him to the threshold, and his friends and companions beyond.
All the people and relatives go as far as the cremation grounds, and then, the soul-swan goes on alone. ||3||
Says Kabeer, listen, O mortal being: you have been seized by Death, and you have fallen into the deep, dark pit.
You have entangled yourself in the false wealth of Maya, like the parrot caught in the trap. ||4||2||
Listening to all the teachings of the Vedas and the Puraanas, I wanted to perform the religious rituals.
But seeing all the wise men caught by Death, I arose and left the Pandits; now I am free of this desire. ||1||
O mind, you have not completed the only task you were given;
you have not meditated on the Lord, your King. ||1||Pause||
Going to the forests, they practice Yoga and deep, austere meditation; they live on roots and the fruits they gather.
The musicians, the Vedic scholars, the chanters of one word and the men of silence, all are listed on the Register of Death. ||2||
Loving devotional worship does not enter into your heart; pampering and adorning your body, you must still give it up.
You sit and play music, but you are still a hypocrite; what do you expect to receive from the Lord? ||3||
Death has fallen on the whole world; the doubting religious scholars are also listed on the Register of Death.
