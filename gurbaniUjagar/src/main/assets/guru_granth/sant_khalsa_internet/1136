Bhairao, Fifth Mehl, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Setting aside all other days, it is said,
that the Lord was born on the eighth lunar day. ||1||
Deluded and confused by doubt, the mortal practices falsehood.
The Lord is beyond birth and death. ||1||Pause||
You prepare sweet treats and feed them to your stone god.
God is not born, and He does not die, you foolish, faithless cynic! ||2||
You sing lullabies to your stone god - this is the source of all your mistakes.
Let that mouth be burnt, which says that our Lord and Master is subject to birth. ||3||
He is not born, and He does not die; He does not come and go in reincarnation.
The God of Nanak is pervading and permeating everywhere. ||4||1||
Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
Standing up, I am at peace; sitting down, I am at peace.
I feel no fear, because this is what I understand. ||1||
The One Lord, my Lord and Master, is my Protector.
He is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of Hearts. ||1||Pause||
I sleep without worry, and I awake without worry.
You, O God, are pervading everywhere. ||2||
I dwell in peace in my home, and I am at peace outside.
Says Nanak, the Guru has implanted His Mantra within me. ||3||2||
Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
I do not keep fasts, nor do I observe the month of Ramadaan.
I serve only the One, who will protect me in the end. ||1||
The One Lord, the Lord of the World, is my God Allah.
He administers justice to both Hindus and Muslims. ||1||Pause||
I do not make pilgrimages to Mecca, nor do I worship at Hindu sacred shrines.
I serve the One Lord, and not any other. ||2||
I do not perform Hindu worship services, nor do I offer the Muslim prayers.
I have taken the One Formless Lord into my heart; I humbly worship Him there. ||3||
I am not a Hindu, nor am I a Muslim.
My body and breath of life belong to Allah - to Raam - the God of both. ||4||
Says Kabeer, this is what I say:
meeting with the Guru, my Spiritual Teacher, I realize God, my Lord and Master. ||5||3||
Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
I easily tied up the deer - the ten sensory organs.
I shot five of the desires with the Word of the Lord's Bani. ||1||
I go out hunting with the Saints,
and we capture the deer without horses or weapons. ||1||Pause||
My mind used to run around outside hunting.
But now, I have found the game within the home of my body-village. ||2||
I caught the deer and brought them home.
Dividing them up, I shared them, bit by bit. ||3||
God has given this gift.
Nanak's home is filled with the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||4||
Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
Even though he may be fed with hundreds of longings and yearnings,
still the faithless cynic does not remember the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||
Take in the teachings of the humble Saints.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, you shall obtain the supreme status. ||1||Pause||
Stones may be kept under water for a long time.
Even so, they do not absorb the water; they remain hard and dry. ||2||
