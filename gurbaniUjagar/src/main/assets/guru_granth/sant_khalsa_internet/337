Some collect hundreds of thousands of dollars,
but in the end, the pitcher of the body bursts. ||3||
Says Kabeer, that single foundation which you have laid
will be destroyed in an instant - you are so egotistical. ||4||1||9||60||
Gauree:
Meditate on the Lord, O my soul,
just as Dhroo and Prahlaad meditated on the Lord. ||1||
O Lord, Merciful to the meek, I have placed my faith in You;
along with all my family, I have come aboard Your boat. ||1||Pause||
When it is pleasing to Him, then He inspires us to obey the Hukam of His Command.
He causes this boat to cross over. ||2||
By Guru's Grace, such understanding is infused into me;
my comings and goings in reincarnation have ended. ||3||
Says Kabeer, meditate, vibrate upon the Lord, the Sustainer of the earth.
In this world, in the world beyond and everywhere, He alone is the Giver. ||4||2||10||61||
Gauree 9:
He leaves the womb, and comes into the world;
as soon as the air touches him, he forgets his Lord and Master. ||1||
O my soul, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
You were upside-down, living in the womb; you generated the intense meditative heat of 'tapas'.
Then, you escaped the fire of the belly. ||2||
After wandering through 8.4 million incarnations, you came.
If you stumble and fall now, you shall find no home or place of rest. ||3||
Says Kabeer, meditate, vibrate upon the Lord, the Sustainer of the earth.
He is not seen to be coming or going; He is the Knower of all. ||4||1||11||62||
Gauree Poorbee:
Don't wish for a home in heaven, and don't be afraid to live in hell.
Whatever will be will be, so don't get your hopes up in your mind. ||1||
Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord,
from whom the most excellent treasure is obtained. ||1||Pause||
What good is chanting, penance or self-mortification? What good is fasting or cleansing baths,
unless you know the way to worship the Lord God with loving devotion? ||2||
Don't feel so delighted at the sight of wealth, and don't weep at the sight of suffering and adversity.
As is wealth, so is adversity; whatever the Lord proposes, comes to pass. ||3||
Says Kabeer, now I know that the Lord dwells within the hearts of His Saints;
that servant performs the best service, whose heart is filled with the Lord. ||4||1||12||63||
Gauree:
O my mind, even if you carry someone's burden, they don't belong to you.
This world is like the perch of the bird on the tree. ||1||
I drink in the sublime essence of the Lord.
With the taste of this essence, I have forgotten all other tastes. ||1||Pause||
Why should we weep at the death of others, when we ourselves are not permanent?
Whoever is born shall pass away; why should we cry out in grief? ||2||
We are re-absorbed into the One from whom we came; drink in the Lord's essence, and remain attached to Him.
Says Kabeer, my consciousness is filled with thoughts of remembrance of the Lord; I have become detached from the world. ||3||2||13||64||
Raag Gauree:
The bride gazes at the path, and sighs with tearful eyes.
Her heart is not happy, but she does not retrace her steps, in hopes of seeing the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan. ||1||
