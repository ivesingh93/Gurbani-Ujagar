Then, this soul is liberated forever, and it remains absorbed in celestial bliss. ||2||
Pauree:
God created the Universe, and He keeps it under His power.
God cannot be obtained by counting; the mortal wanders in doubt.
Meeting the True Guru, one remains dead while yet alive; understanding Him, he is absorbed in the Truth.
Through the Word of the Shabad, egotism is eradicated, and one is united in the Lord's Union.
He knows everything, and Himself does everything; beholding His Creation, He rejoices. ||4||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
One who has not focused his consciousness on the True Guru, and into whose mind the Naam does not come -
cursed is such a life. What has he gained by coming into the world?
Maya is false capital; in an instant, its false covering falls off.
When it slips from his hand, his body turns black, and his face withers away.
Those who focus their consciousness on the True Guru - peace comes to abide in their minds.
They meditate on the Name of the Lord with love; they are lovingly attuned to the Name of the Lord.
O Nanak, the True Guru has bestowed upon them the wealth, which remains contained within their hearts.
They are imbued with supreme love; its color increases day by day. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Maya is a serpent, clinging to the world.
Whoever serves her, she ultimately devours.
The Gurmukh is a snake-charmer; he has trampled her and thrown her down, and crushed her underfoot.
O Nanak, they alone are saved, who remain lovingly absorbed in the True Lord. ||2||
Pauree:
The minstrel cries out, and God hears him.
He is comforted within his mind, and he obtains the Perfect Lord.
Whatever destiny is pre-ordained by the Lord, those are the deeds he does.
When the Lord and Master becomes Merciful, then one obtains the Mansion of the Lord's Presence as his home.
That God of mine is so very great; as Gurmukh, I have met Him. ||5||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
There is One Lord God of all; He remains ever-present.
O Nanak, if one does not obey the Hukam of the Lord's Command, then within one's own home, the Lord seems far away.
They alone obey the Lord's Command, upon whom He casts His Glance of Grace.
Obeying His Command, one obtains peace, and becomes the happy, loving soul-bride. ||1||
Third Mehl:
She who does not love her Husband Lord, burns and wastes away all through the night of her life.
O Nanak, the soul-brides dwell in peace; they have the Lord, their King, as their Husband. ||2||
Pauree:
Roaming over the entire world, I have seen that the Lord is the only Giver.
The Lord cannot be obtained by any device at all; He is the Architect of Karma.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Lord comes to dwell in the mind, and the Lord is easily revealed within.
The fire of desire within is quenched, and one bathes in the Lord's Pool of Ambrosial Nectar.
The great greatness of the great Lord God - the Gurmukh speaks of this. ||6||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
What love is this between the body and soul, which ends when the body falls?
Why feed it by telling lies? When you leave, it does not go with you.
