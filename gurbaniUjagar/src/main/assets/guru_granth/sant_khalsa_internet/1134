Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, vibrate and meditate on the Lord; let your awareness be absorbed in Him. ||1||
O my mind, vibrate and meditate on the Lord and the Name of the Lord.
The Lord, Har, Har, the Giver of Peace, grants His Grace; the Gurmukh crosses over the terrifying world-ocean through the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, sing of the Lord.
Follow the Guru's Teachings, and you shall obtain the Lord, the Source of Nectar. ||2||
Bathe in the pool of ambrosial nectar, the spiritual wisdom of the Holy Guru.
All sins will be eliminated and eradicated. ||3||
You Yourself are the Creator, the Support of the Universe.
Please unite servant Nanak with Yourself; he is the slave of Your slaves. ||4||1||
Bhairao, Fourth Mehl:
Fruitful is that moment when the Lord's Name is spoken.
Following the Guru's Teachings, all pains are taken away. ||1||
O my mind, vibrate the Name of the Lord.
O Lord, be merciful, and unite me with the Perfect Guru. Joining with the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, I shall cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||Pause||
Meditate on the Life of the World; remember the Lord in your mind.
Millions upon millions of your sins shall be taken away. ||2||
In the Sat Sangat, apply the dust of the feet of the holy to your face;
this is how to bathe in the sixty-eight sacred shrines, and the Ganges. ||3||
I am a fool; the Lord has shown mercy to me.
The Savior Lord has saved servant Nanak. ||4||2||
Bhairao, Fourth Mehl:
To do good deeds is the best rosary.
Chant on the beads within your heart, and it shall go along with you. ||1||
Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, the Lord of the forest.
Have mercy on me, Lord, and unite me with the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, so that I may be released from Maya's noose of death. ||1||Pause||
Whoever, as Gurmukh, serves and works hard,
is molded and shaped in the true mint of the Shabad, the Word of God. ||2||
The Guru has revealed to me the Inaccessible and Unfathomable Lord.
Searching within the body-village, I have found the Lord. ||3||
I am just a child; the Lord is my Father, who nurtures and cherishes me.
Please save servant Nanak, Lord; bless him with Your Glance of Grace. ||4||3||
Bhairao, Fourth Mehl:
All hearts are Yours, Lord; You are in all.
There is nothing at all except You. ||1||
O my mind, meditate on the Lord, the Giver of peace.
I praise You, O Lord God, You are my Father. ||1||Pause||
Wherever I look, I see only the Lord God.
All are under Your control; there is no other at all. ||2||
O Lord, when it is Your Will to save someone,
then nothing can threaten him. ||3||
You are totally pervading and permeating the waters, the lands, the skies and all places.
Servant Nanak meditates on the Ever-present Lord. ||4||4||
Bhairao, Fourth Mehl, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The Lord's Saint is the embodiment of the Lord; within his heart is the Name of the Lord.
One who has such destiny inscribed on his forehead, follows the Guru's Teachings, and contemplates the Name of the Lord within his heart. ||1||
