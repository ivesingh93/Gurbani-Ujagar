He has not performed any service to the Creator Lord. ||1||
O God, Your Name is the Purifier of sinners.
I am worthless - please save me! ||1||Pause||
O God, You are the Great Giver, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.
The body of the egotistical human is perishable. ||2||
Tastes and pleasures, conflicts and jealousy, and intoxication with Maya -
attached to these, the jewel of human life is wasted. ||3||
The Sovereign Lord King is the Destroyer of pain, the Life of the world.
Forsaking everything, Nanak has entered His Sanctuary. ||4||13||19||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
He sees with his eyes, but he is called blind; he hears, but he does not hear.
And the One who dwells near at hand, he thinks that He is far away; the sinner is committing sins. ||1||
Do only those deeds which will save you, O mortal being.
Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and the Ambrosial Word of His Bani. ||1||Pause||
You are forever imbued with the love of horses and mansions.
Nothing shall go along with you. ||2||
You may clean and decorate the vessel of clay,
but it is so very filthy; it shall receive its punishment from the Messenger of Death. ||3||
You are bound by sexual desire, anger, greed and emotional attachment.
You are sinking down into the great pit. ||4||
Hear this prayer of Nanak, O Lord;
I am a stone, sinking down - please, rescue me! ||5||14||20||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
One who remains dead while yet alive understands God.
He meets that humble being according to the karma of his past actions. ||1||
Listen, O friend - this is how to cross over the terrifying world-ocean.
Meet with the Holy, and chant the Lord's Name||1||Pause||
There is no other to know, except for the One Lord.
So realize that the Supreme Lord God is within each and every heart. ||2||
Whatever He does, accept that as good.
Know the value of the beginning and the end. ||3||
Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to that humble being,
within whose heart the Lord dwells. ||4||15||21||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
The Guru is the Transcendent Lord, the Creator Lord.
He gives His Support to the entire Universe. ||1||
Meditate within your mind on the Lotus Feet of the Guru.
Pain and suffering shall leave this body. ||1||Pause||
The True Guru saves the drowning being from the terrifying world-ocean.
He reunites those who were separated for countless incarnations. ||2||
Serve the Guru, day and night.
Your mind shall come to have peace, pleasure and poise. ||3||
By great good fortune, one obtains the dust of the feet of the True Guru.
Nanak is forever a sacrifice to the True Guru. ||4||16||22||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
I am a sacrifice to my True Guru.
Twenty-four hours a day, I sing the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||
Meditate in remembrance on God, your Lord and Master.
He is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of all hearts. ||1||Pause||
So love the Lord's Lotus Feet,
and live a lifestyle which is true, perfect and spotless. ||2||
By the Grace of the Saints, the Lord comes to dwell within the mind,
and the sins of countless incarnations are eradicated. ||3||
Please be Merciful, O God, O Merciful to the meek.
Nanak begs for the dust of the Saints. ||4||17||23||
