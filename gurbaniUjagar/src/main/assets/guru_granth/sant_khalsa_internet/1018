He plants his feet in the boat, and then sits down in it; the fatigue of his body is relieved.
The great ocean does not even affect him; in an instant, he arrives on the other shore. ||2||
Sandalwood, aloe, and camphor-paste - the earth does not love them.
But it doesn't mind, if someone digs it up bit by bit, and applies manure and urine to it. ||3||
High and low, bad and good - the comforting canopy of the sky stretches evenly over all.
It knows nothing of friend and enemy; all beings are alike to it. ||4||
Blazing with its dazzling light, the sun rises, and dispels the darkness.
Touching both the pure and the impure, it harbors no hatred to any. ||5||
The cool and fragrant wind gently blows upon all places alike.
Wherever anything is, it touches it there, and does not hesitate a bit. ||6||
Good or bad, whoever comes close to the fire - his cold is taken away.
It knows nothing of its own or others'; it is constant in the same quality. ||7||
Whoever seeks the Sanctuary of the feet of the Sublime Lord - his mind is attuned to the Love of the Beloved.
Constantly singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the World, O Nanak, God becomes merciful to us. ||8||3||
Maaroo, Fifth Mehl, Fourth House, Ashtapadees:

Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:
Please come, O please come into the home of my heart, that I may hear with my ears the Lord's Praises. ||1||Pause||
With your coming, my soul and body are rejuvenated, and I sing with you the Lord's Praises. ||1||
By the Grace of the Saint, the Lord dwells within the heart, and the love of duality is eradicated. ||2||
By the kindness of the devotee, the intellect is enlightened, and pain and evil-mindedness are eradicated. ||3||
Beholding the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, one is sanctified, and is no longer consigned to the womb of reincarnation. ||4||
The nine treasures, wealth and miraculous spiritual powers are obtained, by one who is pleasing to Your mind. ||5||
Without the Saint, I have no place of rest at all; I cannot think of any other place to go. ||6||
I am unworthy; no one gives me sanctuary. But in the Society of the Saints, I merge in God. ||7||
Says Nanak, the Guru has revealed this miracle; within my mind, I enjoy the Lord, Har, Har. ||8||2||5||
