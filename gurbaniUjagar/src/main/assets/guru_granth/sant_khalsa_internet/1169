if you are not drenched with the True Name. ||1||Pause||
One may have the eighteen Puraanas written in his own hand;
he may recite the four Vedas by heart,
and take ritual baths at holy festivals and give charitable donations;
he may observe the ritual fasts, and perform religious ceremonies day and night. ||2||
He may be a Qazi, a Mullah or a Shaykh,
a Yogi or a wandering hermit wearing saffron-colored robes;
he may be a householder, working at his job;
but without understanding the essence of devotional worship, all people are eventually bound and gagged, and driven along by the Messenger of Death. ||3||
Each person's karma is written on his forehead.
According to their deeds, they shall be judged.
Only the foolish and the ignorant issue commands.
O Nanak, the treasure of praise belongs to the True Lord alone. ||4||3||
Basant, Third Mehl:
A person may take off his clothes and be naked.
What Yoga does he practice by having matted and tangled hair?
If the mind is not pure, what use is it to hold the breath at the Tenth Gate?
The fool wanders and wanders, entering the cycle of reincarnation again and again. ||1||
Meditate on the One Lord, O my foolish mind,
and you shall cross over to the other side in an instant. ||1||Pause||
Some recite and expound on the Simritees and the Shaastras;
some sing the Vedas and read the Puraanas;
but they practice hypocrisy and deception with their eyes and minds.
The Lord does not even come near them. ||2||
Even if someone practices such self-discipline,
compassion and devotional worship -
if he is filled with greed, and his mind is engrossed in corruption,
how can he find the Immaculate Lord? ||3||
What can the created being do?
The Lord Himself moves him.
If the Lord casts His Glance of Grace, then his doubts are dispelled.
If the mortal realizes the Hukam of the Lord's Command, he obtains the True Lord. ||4||
If someone's soul is polluted within,
what is the use of his traveling to sacred shrines of pilgrimage all over the world?
O Nanak, when one joins the Society of the True Guru,
then the bonds of the terrifying world-ocean are broken. ||5||4||
Basant, First Mehl:
All the worlds have been fascinated and enchanted by Your Maya, O Lord.
I do not see any other at all - You are everywhere.
You are the Master of Yogis, the Divinity of the divine.
Serving at the Guru's Feet, the Name of the Lord is received. ||1||
O my Beauteous, Deep and Profound Beloved Lord.
As Gurmukh, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord's Name. You are Infinite, the Cherisher of all. ||1||Pause||
Without the Holy Saint, association with the Lord is not obtained.
Without the Guru, one's very fiber is stained with filth.
Without the Lord's Name, one cannot become pure.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, sing the Praises of the True Lord. ||2||
O Savior Lord, that person whom You have saved-
You lead him to meet the True Guru, and so take care of him.
You take away his poisonous egotism and attachment.
You dispel all his sufferings, O Sovereign Lord God. ||3||
His state and condition are sublime; the Lord's Glorious Virtues permeate his body.
Through the Word of the Guru's Teachings, the diamond of the Lord's Name is revealed.
He is lovingly attuned to the Naam; he is rid of the love of duality.
O Lord, let servant Nanak meet the Guru. ||4||5||
Basant, First Mehl:
O my friends and companions, listen with love in your heart.
My Husband Lord is Incomparably Beautiful; He is always with me.
He is Unseen - He cannot be seen. How can I describe Him?
