Through the Shabad, the Word of the True Guru, the Path is known.
With the Guru's Support, one is blessed with the strength of the True Lord.
Dwell on the Naam, and realize the Beauteous Word of His Bani.
If it is Your Will, Lord, You lead me to find Your Door. ||2||
Flying high or sitting down, I am lovingly focused on the One Lord.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I take the Naam as my Support.
There is no ocean of water, no mountain ranges rising up.
I dwell within the home of my own inner being, where there is no path and no one travelling on it. ||3||
You alone know the way to that House in which You dwell. No one else knows the Mansion of Your Presence.
Without the True Guru, there is no understanding. The whole world is buried under its nightmare.
The mortal tries all sorts of things, and weeps and wails, but without the Guru, he does not know the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
In the twinkling of an eye, the Naam saves him, if he realizes the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||4||
Some are foolish, blind, stupid and ignorant.
Some, through fear of the True Guru, take the Support of the Naam.
The True Word of His Bani is sweet, the source of ambrosial nectar.
Whoever drinks it in, finds the Door of Salvation. ||5||
One who, through the love and fear of God, enshrines the Naam within his heart, acts according to the Guru's Instructions and knows the True Bani.
When the clouds release their rain, the earth becomes beautiful; God's Light permeates each and every heart.
The evil-minded ones plant their seed in the barren soil; such is the sign of those who have no Guru.
Without the True Guru, there is utter darkness; they drown there, even without water. ||6||
Whatever God does, is by His Own Will.
That which is pre-ordained cannot be erased.
Bound to the Hukam of the Lord's Command, the mortal does his deeds.
Permeated by the One Word of the Shabad, the mortal is immersed in Truth. ||7||
Your Command, O God, rules in the four directions; Your Name pervades the four corners of the nether regions as well.
The True Word of the Shabad is pervading amongst all. By His Grace, the Eternal One unites us with Himself.
Birth and death hang over the heads of all beings, along with hunger, sleep and dying.
The Naam is pleasing to Nanak's mind; O True Lord, Source of bliss, please bless me with Your Grace. ||8||1||4||
Malaar, First Mehl:
You do not understand the nature of death and liberation.
You are sitting on the river-bank; realize the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||1||
You stork! - how were you caught in the net?
You do not remember in your heart the Unseen Lord God. ||1||Pause||
For your one life, you consume many lives.
You were supposed to swim in the water, but you are drowning in it instead. ||2||
You have tormented all beings.
When Death seizes you, then you shall regret and repent. ||3||
When the heavy noose is placed around your neck,
you may spread your wings, but you shall not be able to fly. ||4||
You enjoy the tastes and flavors, you foolish self-willed manmukh.
You are trapped. You can only be saved by virtuous conduct, spiritual wisdom and contemplation. ||5||
Serving the True Guru, you will shatter the Messenger of Death.
In your heart, dwell on the True Word of the Shabad. ||6||
The Guru's Teachings, the True Word of the Shabad, is excellent and sublime.
Keep the Name of the Lord enshrined in your heart. ||7||
One who is obsessed with enjoying pleasures here, shall suffer in pain hereafter.
O Nanak, there is no liberation without the True Name. ||8||2||5||
