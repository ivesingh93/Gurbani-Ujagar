Uttering His Glorious Praises, suffering is eradicated, and the heart becomes tranquil and calm. ||3||
Drink in the Sweet, Sublime Ambrosial Nectar, O Nanak, and be imbued with the Love of the Lord. ||4||4||15||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
O friends, O Saints, come to me. ||1||Pause||
Singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord with pleasure and joy, the sins will be erased and thrown away. ||1||
Touch your forehead to the feet of the Saints, and your dark household shall be illumined. ||2||
By the Grace of the Saints, the heart-lotus blossoms forth. Vibrate and meditate on the Lord of the Universe, and see Him near at hand. ||3||
By the Grace of God, I have found the Saints. Over and over again, Nanak is a sacrifice to that moment. ||4||5||16||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
I seek the Sanctuary of Your Lotus Feet, O Lord of the World.
Save me from emotional attachment, pride, deception and doubt; please cut away these ropes which bind me. ||1||Pause||
I am drowning in the world-ocean.
Meditating in remembrance on the Lord, the Source of Jewels, I am saved. ||1||
Your Name, Lord, is cooling and soothing.
God, my Lord and Master, is Perfect. ||2||
You are the Deliverer, the Destroyer of the sufferings of the meek and the poor.
The Lord is the Treasure of Mercy, the Saving Grace of sinners. ||3||
I have suffered the pains of millions of incarnations.
Nanak is at peace; the Guru has implanted the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within me. ||4||6||17||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
Blessed is that love, which is attuned to the Lord's Feet.
The peace which comes from millions of chants and deep meditations is obtained by perfect good fortune and destiny. ||1||Pause||
I am Your helpless servant and slave; I have given up all other support.
Every trace of doubt has been eradicated, remembering God in meditation. I have applied the ointment of spiritual wisdom, and awakened from my sleep. ||1||
You are Unfathomable, Great and Utterly Vast, O my Lord and Master, Ocean of Mercy, Source of Jewels.
Nanak, the beggar, begs for the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; he rests his forehead upon God's Feet. ||2||7||18||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
I am filthy, hard-hearted, deceitful and obsessed with sexual desire.
Please carry me across, as You wish, O my Lord and Master. ||1||Pause||
You are All-powerful and Potent to grant Sanctuary. Exerting Your Power, You protect us. ||1||
Chanting and deep meditation, penance and austere self-discipline, fasting and purification - salvation does not come by any of these means.
Please lift me up and out of this deep, dark ditch; O God, please bless Nanak with Your Glance of Grace. ||2||8||19||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl, Fourth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The one who bows in humble reverence to the Primal Lord, the Lord of all beings
- I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to such a Guru; He Himself is liberated, and He carries me across as well. ||1||Pause||
Which, which, which of Your Glorious Virtues should I chant? There is no end or limitation to them.
There are thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, many millions of them, but those who contemplate them are very rare. ||1||
