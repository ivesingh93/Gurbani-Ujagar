The sins and sorrows of countless lifetimes are eradicated; the Lord Himself unites them in His Union. ||Pause||
All of these relatives are like chains upon the soul, O Siblings of Destiny; the world is deluded by doubt.
Without the Guru, the chains cannot be broken; the Gurmukhs find the door of salvation.
One who performs rituals without realizing the Word of the Guru's Shabad, shall die and be reborn, again and again. ||2||
The world is entangled in egotism and possessiveness, O Siblings of Destiny, but no one belongs to anyone else.
The Gurmukhs attain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, singing the Glories of the Lord; they dwell in the home of their own inner being.
One who understands here, realizes himself; the Lord God belongs to him. ||3||
The True Guru is forever merciful, O Siblings of Destiny; without good destiny, what can anyone obtain?
He looks alike upon all with His Glance of Grace, but people receive the fruits of their rewards according to their love for the Lord.
O Nanak, when the Naam, the Name of the Lord, comes to dwell within the mind, then self-conceit is eradicated from within. ||4||6||
Sorat'h, Third Mehl, Chau-Tukas:
True devotional worship is obtained only through the True Guru, when the True Word of His Bani is in the heart.
Serving the True Guru, eternal peace is obtained; egotism is obliterated through the Word of the Shabad.
Without the Guru, there is no true devotion; otherwise, people wander around, deluded by ignorance.
The self-willed manmukhs wander around, suffering in constant pain; they drown and die, even without water. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, remain forever in the Lord's Sanctuary, under His Protection.
Bestowing His Glance of Grace, He preserves our honor, and blesses us with the glory of the Lord's Name. ||Pause||
Through the Perfect Guru, one comes to understand himself, contemplating the True Word of the Shabad.
The Lord, the Life of the world, ever abides in his heart, and he renounces sexual desire, anger and egotism.
The Lord is ever-present, permeating and pervading all places; the Name of the Infinite Lord is enshrined within the heart.
Throughout the ages, through the Word of His Bani, His Shabad is realized, and the Name becomes so sweet and beloved to the mind. ||2||
Serving the Guru, one realizes the Naam, the Name of the Lord; fruitful is his life, and his coming into the world.
Tasting the sublime elixir of the Lord, his mind is satisfied and satiated forever; singing the Glories of the Glorious Lord, he is fulfilled and satisfied.
The lotus of his heart blossoms forth, he is ever imbued with the Lord's Love, and the unstruck melody of the Shabad resounds within him.
His body and mind become immaculately pure; his speech becomes immaculate as well, and he merges in the Truest of the True. ||3||
No one knows the state of the Lord's Name; through the Guru's Teachings, it comes to abide in the heart.
One who becomes Gurmukh, understands the Path; his tongue savors the sublime essence of the Lord's Nectar.
Meditation, austere self-discipline and self-restraint are all obtained from the Guru; the Naam, the Name of the Lord, comes to abide within the heart.
O Nanak, those humble beings who praise the Naam are beautiful; they are honored in the Court of the True Lord. ||4||7||
Sorat'h, Third Mehl, Du-Tukas:
Meeting the True Guru, one turns away from the world, O Siblings of Destiny; when he remains dead while yet alive, he obtains true understanding.
He alone is the Guru, and he alone is a Sikh, O Siblings of Destiny, whose light merges in the Light. ||1||
O my mind, be lovingly attuned to the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
Chanting the Name of the Lord, it seems so sweet to the mind, O Siblings of Destiny; the Gurmukhs obtain a place in the Court of the Lord. ||Pause||
