The Guru who gave me my soul,
has Himself purchased me, and made me His slave. ||6||
He Himself has blessed me with His Love.
Forever and ever, I humbly bow to the Guru. ||7||
My troubles, conflicts, fears, doubts and pains have been dispelled;
says Nanak, my Guru is All-powerful. ||8||9||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Meet me, O my Lord of the Universe. Please bless me with Your Name.
Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, cursed, cursed is love and intimacy. ||1||Pause||
Without the Naam, one who dresses and eats well
is like a dog, who falls in and eats impure foods. ||1||
Without the Naam, all occupations are useless,
like the decorations on a dead body. ||2||
One who forgets the Naam and indulges in pleasures,
shall find no peace, even in dreams; his body shall become diseased. ||3||
One who renounces the Naam and engages in other occupations,
shall see all of his false pretenses fall away. ||4||
One whose mind does not embrace love for the Naam
shall go to hell, even though he may perform millions of ceremonial rituals. ||5||
One whose mind does not contemplate the Name of the Lord
is bound like a thief, in the City of Death. ||6||
Hundreds of thousands of ostentatious shows and great expanses -
without the Naam, all these displays are false. ||7||
That humble being repeats the Name of the Lord,
O Nanak, whom the Lord blesses with His Mercy. ||8||10||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
The one who shall stand by me in the beginning, in the middle and in the end,
my mind longs for that Friend. ||1||
The Lord's Love goes with us forever.
The Perfect and Merciful Lord cherishes all. ||1||Pause||
He shall never perish, and He shall never abandon me.
Wherever I look, there I see Him pervading and permeating. ||2||
He is Beautiful, All-knowing, the most Clever, the Giver of life.
God is my Brother, Son, Father and Mother. ||3||
He is the Support of the breath of life; He is my Wealth.
Abiding within my heart, He inspires me to enshrine love for Him. ||4||
The Lord of the World has cut away the noose of Maya.
He has made me His own, blessing me with His Glance of Grace. ||5||
Remembering, remembering Him in meditation, all diseases are healed.
Meditating on His Feet, all comforts are enjoyed. ||6||
The Perfect Primal Lord is Ever-fresh and Ever-young.
The Lord is with me, inwardly and outwardly, as my Protector. ||7||
Says Nanak, that devotee who realizes the state of the Lord, Har, Har,
is blessed with the treasure of the Naam. ||8||11||
Raag Gauree Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Countless are those who wander around searching for You, but they do not find Your limits.
They alone are Your devotees, who are blessed by Your Grace. ||1||
I am a sacrifice, I am a sacrifice to You. ||1||Pause||
Continually hearing of the terrifying path, I am so afraid.
I have sought the Protection of the Saints; please, save me! ||2||
