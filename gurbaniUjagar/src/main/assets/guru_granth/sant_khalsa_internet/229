Gauree, First Mehl:
By Guru's Grace, one comes to understand, and then, the account is settled.
In each and every heart is the Name of the Immaculate Lord; He is my Lord and Master. ||1||
Without the Word of the Guru's Shabad, no one is emancipated. See this, and reflect upon it.
Even though you may perform hundreds of thousands of rituals, without the Guru, there is only darkness. ||1||Pause||
What can you say, to one who is blind and without wisdom?
Without the Guru, the Path cannot be seen. How can anyone proceed? ||2||
He calls the counterfeit genuine, and does not know the value of the genuine.
The blind man is known as an appraiser; this Dark Age of Kali Yuga is so strange! ||3||
The sleeper is said to be awake, and those who are awake are like sleepers.
The living are said to be dead, and no one mourns for those who have died. ||4||
One who is coming is said to be going, and one who is gone is said to have come.
That which belongs to others, he calls his own, but he has no liking for that which is his. ||5||
That which is sweet is said to be bitter, and the bitter is said to be sweet.
One who is imbued with the Lord's Love is slandered - his is what I have seen in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga. ||6||
He serves the maid, and does not see his Lord and Master.
Churning the water in the pond, no butter is produced. ||7||
One who understands the meaning of this verse is my Guru.
O Nanak, one who knows his own self, is infinite and incomparable. ||8||
He Himself is All-pervading; He Himself misleads the people.
By Guru's Grace, one comes to understand, that God is contained in all. ||9||2||18||
Raag Gauree Gwaarayree, Third Mehl, Ashtapadees:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The pollution of the mind is the love of duality.
Deluded by doubt, people come and go in reincarnation. ||1||
The pollution of the self-willed manmukhs will never go away,
as long as they do not dwell on the Shabad, and the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
All the created beings are contaminated by emotional attachment;
they die and are reborn, only to die over and over again. ||2||
Fire, air and water are polluted.
The food which is eaten is polluted. ||3||
The actions of those who do not worship the Lord are polluted.
Attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the mind becomes immaculate. ||4||
Serving the True Guru, pollution is eradicated,
and then, one does not suffer death and rebirth, or get devoured by death. ||5||
You may study and examine the Shaastras and the Simritees,
but without the Name, no one is liberated. ||6||
Throughout the four ages, the Naam is the ultimate; reflect upon the Word of the Shabad.
In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, only the Gurmukhs cross over. ||7||
The True Lord does not die; He does not come or go.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh remains absorbed in the Lord. ||8||1||
Gauree, Third Mehl:
Selfless service is the support of the breath of life of the Gurmukh.
Keep the Dear Lord enshrined in your heart.
The Gurmukh is honored in the Court of the True Lord. ||1||
O Pandit, O religious scholar, read about the Lord, and renounce your corrupt ways.
The Gurmukh crosses over the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||Pause||
