Trying all sorts of things, I have grown weary, but still, they will not leave me alone.
But I have heard that they can be rooted out, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; and so I seek their Shelter. ||2||
In their Mercy, the Saints have met me, and from them, I have obtained satisfaction.
The Saints have given me the Mantra of the Fearless Lord, and now I practice the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||3||
I have now conquered those terrible evil-doers, and my speech is now sweet and sublime.
Says Nanak, the Divine Light has dawned within my mind; I have obtained the state of Nirvaanaa. ||4||4||125||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
He is the Eternal King.
The Fearless Lord abides with you. So where does this fear come from? ||1||Pause||
In one person, You are arrogant and proud, and in another, You are meek and humble.
In one person, You are all by Yourself, and in another, You are poor. ||1||
In one person, you are a Pandit, a religious scholar and a preacher, and in another, You are just a fool.
In one person, You grab hold of everything, and in another, You accept nothing. ||2||
What can the poor wooden puppet do? The Master Puppeteer knows everything.
As the Puppeteer dresses the puppet, so is the role the puppet plays. ||3||
The Lord has created the various chambers of assorted descriptions, and He Himself protects them.
As is that vessel in which the Lord places the soul, so does it dwell. What can this poor being do? ||4||
The One who created the thing, understands it; He has fashioned all of this.
Says Nanak, the Lord and Master is Infinite; He alone understands the value of His Creation. ||5||5||126||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Give them up - give up the pleasures of corruption;
you are entangled in them, you crazy fool, like an animal grazing in the green fields. ||1||Pause||
That which you believe to be of use to you, shall not go even an inch with you.
Naked you came, and naked you shall depart. You shall go round and round the cycle of birth and death, and you shall be food for Death. ||1||
Watching, watching the transitory dramas of the world, you are embroiled and enmeshed in them, and you laugh with delight.
The string of life is wearing thin, day and night, and you have done nothing for your soul. ||2||
Doing your deeds, you have grown old; your voice fails you, and your body has become weak.
You were enticed by Maya in your youth, and your attachment for it has not diminished, one little bit. ||3||
The Guru has shown me that this is the way of the world; I have abandoned the dwelling of pride, and entered Your Sanctuary.
The Saint has shown me the Path of God; slave Nanak has implanted devotional worship and the Praise of the Lord. ||4||6||127||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Except for You, who is mine?
O my Beloved, You are the Support of the breath of life. ||1||Pause||
You alone know the condition of my inner being. You are my Beautiful Friend.
I receive all comforts from You, O my Unfathomable and Immeasurable Lord and Master. ||1||
