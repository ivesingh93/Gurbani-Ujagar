O my mind, enshrine love for the Name of the Lord.
The Guru, satisfied and pleased, taught me about the Lord, and my Sovereign Lord King met with me at once. ||1||Pause||
The self-willed manmukh is like the ignorant bride, who comes and goes again and again in reincarnation.
The Lord God does not come into her consciousness, and her mind is stuck in the love of duality. ||2||
I am full of filth, and I practice evil deeds; O Lord, save me, be with me, merge me into Your Being!
The Guru has bathed me in the pool of Ambrosial Nectar, and all my dirty sins and mistakes have been washed away. ||3||
O Lord God, Merciful to the meek and the poor, please unite me with the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation.
Joining the Sangat, servant Nanak has obtained the Lord's Love; my mind and body are drenched in it. ||4||3||
Soohee, Fourth Mehl:
One who chants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, while constantly practicing deception, shall never become pure of heart.
He may perform all sorts of rituals, night and day, but he shall not find peace, even in dreams. ||1||
O wise ones, without the Guru, there is no devotional worship.
The untreated cloth does not take up the dye, no matter how much everyone may wish it. ||1||Pause||
The self-willed manmukh may perform chants, meditations, austere self-discipline, fasts and devotional worship, but his sickness does not go away.
Deep within him is the sickness of excessive egotism; in the love of duality he is ruined. ||2||
Outwardly, he wears religious robes and he is very clever, but his mind wanders in the ten directions.
Engrossed in ego, he does not remember the Word of the Shabad; over and over again, he is reincarnated. ||3||
O Nanak, that mortal who is blessed with the Lord's Glance of Grace, understands Him; that humble servant meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
By Guru's Grace, he understands the One Lord, and is absorbed into the One Lord. ||4||4||
Soohee, Fourth Mehl, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Following the Guru's Teachings, I searched and searched the body-village;
I found the wealth of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||
The Lord, Har, Har, has enshrined peace within my mind.
The fire of desire was extinguished in an instant, when I met the Guru; all my hunger has been satisfied. ||1||Pause||
Singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, I live, O my mother.
The Merciful True Guru implanted the Glorious Praises of the Naam within me. ||2||
I search for and seek out my Beloved Lord God, Har, Har.
Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, I have obtained the subtle essence of the Lord. ||3||
By the pre-ordained destiny inscribed upon my forehead, I have found the Lord.
Guru Nanak, pleased and satisfied, has united me with the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny. ||4||1||5||
Soohee, Fourth Mehl:
Showering His Mercy, the Lord imbues the mind with His Love.
The Gurmukh merges in the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||
Imbued with the Lord's Love, the mortal enjoys the pleasure of His Love.
He remains always blissful, day and night, and he merges into the Shabad, the Word of the Perfect Guru. ||1||Pause||
Everyone longs for the Lord's Love;
the Gurmukh is imbued with the deep red color of His Love. ||2||
The foolish, self-willed manmukh is left pale and uncolored.
