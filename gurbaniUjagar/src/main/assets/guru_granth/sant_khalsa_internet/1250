In the end, hatred and conflict well up, and no one can save him.
O Nanak, without the Name, those loving attachments are cursed; engrossed in them, he suffers in pain. ||32||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
The Guru's Word is the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam. Eating it, all hunger departs.
There is no thirst or desire at all, when the Naam comes to dwell in the mind.
Eating anything other than the Name, disease runs to afflict the body.
O Nanak, whoever takes the Praise of the Shabad as his spices and flavors - the Lord unites him in His Union. ||1||
Third Mehl:
The life within all living beings is the Word of the Shabad. Through it, we meet our Husband Lord.
Without the Shabad, the world is in darkness. Through the Shabad, it is enlightened.
The Pandits, the religious scholars, and the silent sages read and write until they are weary. The religious fanatics are tired of washing their bodies.
Without the Shabad, no one attains the Lord; the miserable depart weeping and wailing.
O Nanak, by His Glance of Grace, the Merciful Lord is attained. ||2||
Pauree:
The husband and wife are very much in love; sitting together, they make evil plans.
All that is seen shall pass away. This is the Will of my God.
How can anyone remain in this world forever? Some may try to devise a plan.
Working for the Perfect Guru, the wall becomes permanent and stable.
O Nanak, the Lord forgives them, and merges them into Himself; they are absorbed in the Lord's Name. ||33||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Attached to Maya, the mortal forgets the Fear of God and Guru, and love for the Infinite Lord.
The waves of greed take away his wisdom and understanding, and he does not embrace love for the True Lord.
The Word of the Shabad abides in the mind of the Gurmukhs, who find the Gate of Salvation.
O Nanak, the Lord Himself forgives them, and unites them in Union with Himself. ||1||
Fourth Mehl:
O Nanak, without Him, we could not live for a moment. Forgetting Him, we could not succeed for an instant.
O mortal, how can you be angry with the One who cares for you? ||2||
Fourth Mehl:
The rainy season of Saawan has come. The Gurmukh meditates on the Lord's Name.
All pain, hunger and misfortune end, when the rain falls in torrents.
The entire earth is rejuvenated, and the grain grows in abundance.
The Carefree Lord, by His Grace, summons that mortal whom the Lord Himself approves.
So meditate on the Lord, O Saints; He shall save you in the end.
The Kirtan of the Lord's Praises and devotion to Him is bliss; peace shall come to dwell in the mind.
Those Gurmukhs who worship the Naam, the Name of the Lord - their pain and hunger departs.
Servant Nanak is satisfied, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. Please embellish him with the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. ||3||
Pauree:
The Perfect Guru bestows His gifts, which increase day by day.
The Merciful Lord Himself bestows them; they cannot be concealed by concealment.
The heart-lotus blossoms forth, and the mortal is lovingly absorbed in the state of supreme bliss.
If anyone tries to challenge him, the Lord throws dust on his head.
O Nanak, no one can equal the glory of the Perfect True Guru. ||34||
