I cannot endure the night, and sleep does not come, without the Sight of the Beloved Guru's Court. ||3||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to that True Court of the Beloved Guru. ||1||Pause||
By good fortune, I have met the Saint Guru.
I have found the Immortal Lord within the home of my own self.
I will now serve You forever, and I shall never be separated from You, even for an instant. Servant Nanak is Your slave, O Beloved Master. ||4||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice; servant Nanak is Your slave, Lord. ||Pause||1||8||
Raag Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
Sweet is that season when I remember You.
Sublime is that work which is done for You.
Blessed is that heart in which You dwell, O Giver of all. ||1||
You are the Universal Father of all, O my Lord and Master.
Your nine treasures are an inexhaustible storehouse.
Those unto whom You give are satisfied and fulfilled; they become Your devotees, Lord. ||2||
All place their hopes in You.
You dwell deep within each and every heart.
All share in Your Grace; none are beyond You. ||3||
You Yourself liberate the Gurmukhs;
You Yourself consign the self-willed manmukhs to wander in reincarnation.
Slave Nanak is a sacrifice to You; Your Entire Play is self-evident, Lord. ||4||2||9||
Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
The Unstruck Melody resounds and resonates in peaceful ease.
I rejoice in the eternal bliss of the Word of the Shabad.
In the cave of intuitive wisdom I sit, absorbed in the silent trance of the Primal Void. I have obtained my seat in the heavens. ||1||
After wandering through many other homes and houses, I have returned to my own home,
and I have found what I was longing for.
I am satisfied and fulfilled; O Saints, the Guru has shown me the Fearless Lord God. ||2||
He Himself is the King, and He Himself is the people.
He Himself is in Nirvaanaa, and He Himself indulges in pleasures.
He Himself sits on the throne of true justice, answering the cries and prayers of all. ||3||
As I have seen Him, so have I described Him.
This Sublime Essence comes only to one who knows the Mystery of the Lord.
His light merges into the Light, and he finds peace. O servant Nanak, this is all the Extension of the One. ||4||3||10||
Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
That house, in which the soul-bride has married her Husband Lord -
in that house, O my companions, sing the songs of rejoicing.
Joy and celebrations decorate that house, in which the Husband Lord has adorned His soul-bride. ||1||
She is virtuous, and she is very fortunate;
she is blessed with sons and tender-hearted. The happy soul-bride is loved by her Husband.
She is beautiful, wise, and clever. That soul-bride is the beloved of her Husband Lord. ||2||
She is well-mannered, noble and distinguished.
She is decorated and adorned with wisdom.
She is from a most respected family; she is the queen, adorned with the Love of her Husband Lord. ||3||
Her glory cannot be described;
she melts in the Embrace of her Husband Lord.
