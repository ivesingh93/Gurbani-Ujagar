The Lord Himself directs the evolution of the world of the five elements; He Himself infuses the five senses into it.
O servant Nanak, the Lord Himself unites us with the True Guru; He Himself resolves the conflicts. ||2||3||
Bairaaree, Fourth Mehl:
Chant the Name of the Lord, O mind, and you shall be emancipated.
The Lord shall destroy all the sins of millions upon millions of incarnations, and carry you across the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||Pause||
In the body-village, the Lord Master abides; the Lord is without fear, without vengeance, and without form.
The Lord is dwelling near at hand, but He cannot be seen. By the Guru's Teachings, the Lord is obtained. ||1||
The Lord Himself is the banker, the jeweler, the jewel, the gem; the Lord Himself created the entire expanse of the creation.
O Nanak, one who is blessed by the Lord's Kind Mercy, trades in the Lord's Name; He alone is the true banker, the true trader. ||2||4||
Bairaaree, Fourth Mehl:
Meditate, O mind, on the immaculate, formless Lord.
Forever and ever, meditate on the Lord, the Giver of peace; He has no end or limitation. ||1||Pause||
In the fiery pit of the womb, when you were hanging upside-down, the Lord absorbed You in His Love, and preserved You.
So serve such a Lord, O my mind; the Lord shall deliver you in the end. ||1||
Bow down in reverence to that humble being, within whose heart the Lord, Har, Har, abides.
By the Lord's Kind Mercy, O Nanak, one obtains the Lord's meditation, and the support of the Naam. ||2||5||
Bairaaree, Fourth Mehl:
O my mind, chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; meditate on it continually.
You shall obtain the fruits of your heart's desires, and pain shall never touch you again. ||1||Pause||
That is chanting, that is deep meditation and austerity, that is fasting and worship, which inspires love for the Lord.
Without the Lord's Love, every other love is false; in an instant, it is all forgotten. ||1||
You are infinite, the Master of all power; Your value cannot be described at all.
Nanak has come to Your Sanctuary, O Dear Lord; as it pleases You, save him. ||2||6||
Raag Bairaaree, Fifth Mehl, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Meeting with the humble Saints, sing the Praises of the Lord.
The pains of millions of incarnations shall be eradicated. ||1||Pause||
Whatever your mind desires, that you shall obtain.
By His Kind Mercy, the Lord blesses us with His Name. ||1||
All happiness and greatness are in the Lord's Name.
By Guru's Grace, Nanak has gained this understanding. ||2||1||7||
