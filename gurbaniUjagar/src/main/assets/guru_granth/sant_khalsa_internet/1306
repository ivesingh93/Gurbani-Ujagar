Making pilgrimages to sacred rivers, observing the six rituals, wearing matted and tangled hair, performing fire sacrifices and carrying ceremonial walking sticks - none of these are of any use. ||1||
All sorts of efforts, austerities, wanderings and various speeches - none of these will lead you to find the Lord's Place.
I have considered all considerations, O Nanak, but peace comes only by vibrating and meditating on the Name. ||2||2||39||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl, Ninth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The Purifier of sinners, the Lover of His devotees, the Destroyer of fear - He carries us across to the other side. ||1||Pause||
My eyes are satisfied, gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan; my ears are satisfied, hearing His Praise. ||1||
He is the Master of the praanaa, the breath of life; He is the Giver of Support to the unsupported. I am meek and poor - I seek the Sanctuary of the Lord of the Universe.
He is the Fulfiller of hope, the Destroyer of pain. Nanak grasps the Support of the Feet of the Lord. ||2||1||40||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
I seek the Sanctuary of the Feet of my Merciful Lord and Master; I do not go anywhere else.
It is the Inherent Nature of our Lord and Master to purify sinners. Those who meditate on the Lord are saved. ||1||Pause||
The world is a swamp of wickedness and corruption. The blind sinner has fallen into the ocean of emotional attachment and pride,
bewildered by the entanglements of Maya.
God Himself has taken me by the hand and lifted me up and out of it; save me, O Sovereign Lord of the Universe. ||1||
He is the Master of the masterless, the Supporting Lord of the Saints, the Neutralizer of millions of sins.
My mind thirsts for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan.
God is the Perfect Treasure of Virtue.
O Nanak, sing and savor the Glorious Praises of the Lord, the Kind and Compassionate Lord of the World. ||2||2||41||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
Countless times, I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice
to that moment of peace, on that night when I was joined with my Beloved. ||1||Pause||
Mansions of gold, and beds of silk sheets - O sisters, I have no love for these. ||1||
Pearls, jewels and countless pleasures, O Nanak, are useless and destructive without the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Even with only dry crusts of bread, and a hard floor on which to sleep, my life passes in peace and pleasure with my Beloved, O sisters. ||2||3||42||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
Give up your ego, and turn your face to God.
Let your yearning mind call out, "Guru, Guru".
My Beloved is the Lover of Love. ||1||Pause||
The bed of your household shall be cozy, and your courtyard shall be comfortable; shatter and break the bonds which tie you to the five thieves. ||1||
You shall not come and go in reincarnation; you shall dwell in your own home deep within, and your inverted heart-lotus shall blossom forth.
The turmoil of egotism shall be silenced.
Nanak sings - he sings the Praises of God, the Ocean of Virtue. ||2||4||43||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl, Ninth House:
This is why you should chant and meditate on the Lord, O mind.
The Vedas and the Saints say that the path is treacherous and difficult. You are intoxicated with emotional attachment and the fever of egotism. ||Pause||
Those who are imbued and intoxicated with the wretched Maya, suffer the pains of emotional attachment. ||1||
That humble being is saved, who chants the Naam; You Yourself save him.
Emotional attachment, fear and doubt are dispelled, O Nanak, by the Grace of the Saints. ||2||5||44||
