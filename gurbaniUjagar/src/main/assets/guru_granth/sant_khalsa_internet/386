He alone is pleasing to Your Will, who chants the Naam. ||1||Pause||
My body and mind are cooled and soothed, chanting the Name of the Lord.
Meditating on the Lord, Har, Har, the house of pain is demolished. ||2||
He alone, who understands the Command of the Lord's Will, is approved.
The True Shabad of the Word of God is his trademark and insignia. ||3||
The Perfect Guru has implanted the Lord's Name within me.
Prays Nanak, my mind has found peace. ||4||8||59||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Wherever You send me, there I go.
Whatever You give me, brings me peace. ||1||
I am forever the chaylaa, the humble disciple, of the Lord of the Universe, the Sustainer of the World.
By Your Grace, I am satisfied and satiated. ||1||Pause||
Whatever You give me, I wear and eat.
By Your Grace, O God, my life passes peacefully. ||2||
Deep within my mind and body, I meditate on You.
I recognize none as equal to You. ||3||
Says Nanak, this is my continual meditation:
that I may be emancipated, clinging to the Feet of the Saints. ||4||9||60||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
While standing up, and sitting down, and even while asleep, meditate on the Lord.
Walking on the Way, sing the Praises of the Lord. ||1||
With your ears, listen to the Ambrosial Sermon.
Listening to it, your mind shall be filled with bliss, and the troubles and diseases of your mind shall all depart. ||1||Pause||
While you work at your job, on the road and at the beach, meditate and chant.
By Guru's Grace, drink in the Ambrosial Essence of the Lord. ||2||
The humble being who sings the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises, day and night,
does not have to go with the Messenger of Death. ||3||
One who does not forget the Lord, twenty-four hours a day, is emancipated;
O Nanak, I fall at his feet. ||4||10||61||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Remembering Him in meditation, one abides in peace;
one becomes happy, and suffering is ended. ||1||
Celebrate, make merry, and sing God's Glories.
Forever and ever, surrender to the True Guru. ||1||Pause||
Act in accordance with the Shabad, the True Word of the True Guru.
Remain steady and stable within the home of your own self, and find God. ||2||
Do not harbor evil intentions against others in your mind,
and you shall not be troubled, O Siblings of Destiny, O friends. ||3||
The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is the Tantric exercise, and the Mantra, given by the Guru.
Nanak knows this peace alone, night and day. ||4||11||62||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
That wretched being, whom no one knows -
chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he is honored in the four directions. ||1||
I beg for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan; please, give it to me, O Beloved!
Serving You, who, who has not been saved? ||1||Pause||
That person, whom no one wants to be near -
the whole world comes to wash the dirt of his feet. ||2||
That mortal, who is of no use to anyone at all -
by the Grace of the Saints, he meditates on the Naam. ||3||
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the sleeping mind awakens.
Then, O Nanak, God seems sweet. ||4||12||63||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
With my eyes, I behold the One and Only Lord.
Forever and ever, I contemplate the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||
