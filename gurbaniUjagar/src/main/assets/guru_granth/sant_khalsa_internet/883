One who knows that God created him, reaches the Incomparable Mansion of the Lord's Presence.
Worshipping the Lord, I sing His Glorious Praises. Nanak is Your slave. ||4||1||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
Place yourself beneath all men's feet, and you will be uplifted; serve Him in this way.
Know that all are above you, and you shall find peace in the Court of the Lord. ||1||
O Saints, speak that speech,
which purifies the gods and sanctifies the divine beings. As Gurmukh, chant the Word of His Bani, even for an instant. ||1||Pause||
Renounce your fraudulent plans, and dwell in the celestial palace; do not call anyone else false.
Meeting with the True Guru, you shall receive the nine treasures; in this way, you shall find the essence of reality. ||2||
Eradicate doubt, and as Gurmukh, enshrine love for the Lord; understand your own soul, O Siblings of Destiny.
Know that God is near at hand, and ever-present. How could you try to hurt anyone else? ||3||
Meeting with the True Guru, your path shall be clear, and you shall easily meet your Lord and Master.
Blessed, blessed are those humble beings, who, in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, find the Lord. Nanak is forever a sacrifice to them. ||4||2||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
Coming does not please me, and going does not bring me pain, and so my mind is not afflicted by disease.
I am in bliss forever, for I have found the Perfect Guru; my separation from the Lord is totally ended. ||1||
This is how I have joined my mind to the Lord.
Attachment, sorrow, disease and public opinion do not affect me, and so, I enjoy the subtle essence of the Lord, Har, Har, Har. ||1||Pause||
I am pure in the heavenly realm, pure on this earth, and pure in the nether regions of the underworld. I remain apart from the people of the world.
Obedient to the Lord, I enjoy peace forever; wherever I look, I see the Lord of glorious virtues. ||2||
There is no Shiva or Shakti, no energy or matter, no water or wind, no world of form there,
where the True Guru, the Yogi, dwells, where the Imperishable Lord God, the Unapproachable Master abides. ||3||
Body and mind belong to the Lord; all wealth belongs to the Lord; what glorious virtues of the Lord can I describe?
Says Nanak, the Guru has destroyed my sense of 'mine and yours'. Like water with water, I am blended with God. ||4||3||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
It is beyond the three qualities; it remains untouched. The seekers and Siddhas do not know it.
There is a chamber filled with jewels, overflowing with Ambrosial Nectar, in the Guru's Treasury. ||1||
This thing is wonderful and amazing! It cannot be described.
It is an unfathomable object, O Siblings of Destiny! ||1||Pause||
Its value cannot be estimated at all; what can anyone say about it?
By speaking and describing it, it cannot be understood; only one who sees it realizes it. ||2||
Only the Creator Lord knows it; what can any poor creature do?
Only He Himself knows His own state and extent. The Lord Himself is the treasure overflowing. ||3||
Tasting such Ambrosial Nectar, the mind remains satisfied and satiated.
Says Nanak, my hopes are fulfilled; I have found the Guru's Sanctuary. ||4||4||
