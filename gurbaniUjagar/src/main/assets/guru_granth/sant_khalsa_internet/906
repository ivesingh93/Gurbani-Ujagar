and wandering around at places of pilgrimage, the disease is not taken away.
Without the Naam, how can one find peace? ||4||
No matter how much he tries, he cannot control his semen and seed.
His mind wavers, and he falls into hell.
Bound and gagged in the City of Death, he is tortured.
Without the Name, his soul cries out in agony. ||5||
The many Siddhas and seekers, silent sages and demi-gods
cannot satisfy themselves by practicing restraint through Hatha Yoga.
One who contemplates the Word of the Shabad, and serves the Guru -
his mind and body become immaculate, and his egotistical pride is obliterated. ||6||
Blessed with Your Grace, I obtain the True Name.
I remain in Your Sanctuary, in loving devotion.
Love for Your devotional worship has welled up within me.
As Gurmukh, I chant and meditate on the Lord's Name. ||7||
When one is rid of egotism and pride, his mind is drenched in the Lord's Love.
Practicing fraud and hypocrisy, he does not find God.
Without the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he cannot find the Lord's Door.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh contemplates the essence of reality. ||8||6||
Raamkalee, First Mehl:
As you come, so will you leave, you fool; as you were born, so will you die.
As you enjoy pleasures, so will you suffer pain. Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, you will fall into the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||
Gazing upon your body and wealth, you are so proud.
Your love for gold and sexual pleasures increases; why have you forgotten the Naam, and why do you wander in doubt? ||1||Pause||
You do not practice truth, abstinence, self-discipline or humility; the ghost within your skeleton has turned to dry wood.
You have not practiced charity, donations, cleansing baths or austerities. Without the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, your life has gone in vain. ||2||
Attached to greed, you have forgotten the Naam. Coming and going, your life has been ruined.
When the Messenger of Death grabs you by your hair, you will be punished. You are unconscious, and have fallen into Death's mouth. ||3||
Day and night, you jealously slander others; in your heart, you have neither the Naam, nor compassion for all.
Without the Word of the Guru's Shabad, you will not find salvation or honor. Without the Lord's Name, you shall go to hell. ||4||
In an instant, you change into various costumes, like a juggler; you are entangled in emotional attachment and sin.
You gaze here and there upon the expanse of Maya; you are intoxicated with attachment to Maya. ||5||
You act in corruption, and put on ostentatious shows, but without awareness of the Shabad, you have fallen into confusion.
You suffer great pain from the disease of egotism. Following the Guru's Teachings, you shall be rid of this disease. ||6||
Seeing peace and wealth come to him, the faithless cynic become proud in his mind.
But He who owns this body and wealth, takes them back again, and then the mortal feels anxiety and pain deep within. ||7||
At the very last instant, nothing goes along with you; all is visible only by His Mercy.
God is our Primal and Infinite Lord; enshrining the Lord's Name in the heart, one crosses over. ||8||
You weep for the dead, but who hears you weeping? The dead have fallen to the serpent in the terrifying world-ocean.
Gazing upon his family, wealth, household and mansions, the faithless cynic is entangled in worthless worldly affairs. ||9||
