O Nanak, they alone look beautiful in the Court of the Lord, whom the Lord has made His Own. ||1||
Maya is a mirage, which deludes the mind, O my companion, like the scent-crazed deer, or the transitory shade of a tree.
Maya is fickle, and does not go with you, O my companion; in the end, it will leave you.
He may enjoy pleasures and sensual delights with supremely beautiful women, but no one finds peace in this way.
Blessed, blessed are the humble, Holy Saints of the Lord, O my companion. O Nanak, they meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||
Go, O my very fortunate companion: dwell in the Company of the Saints, and merge with the Lord.
There, neither pain nor hunger nor disease will afflict you; enshrine love for the Lord's Lotus Feet.
There is no birth or death there, no coming or going in reincarnation, when you enter the Sanctuary of the Eternal Lord.
Love does not end, and attachment does not grip you, O Nanak, when you meditate on the One Lord. ||3||
Bestowing His Glance of Grace, my Beloved has pierced my mind, and I am intuitively attuned to His Love.
My bed is embellished, meeting with my Beloved; in ecstasy and bliss, I sing His Glorious Praises.
O my friends and companions, I am imbued with the Lord's Love; the desires of my mind and body are satisfied.
O Nanak, the wonder-struck soul blends with the Wonderful Lord; this state cannot be described. ||4||2||5||
Raag Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl, Fourth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The entire Universe is the form of the One Lord.
He Himself is the trade, and He Himself is the trader. ||1||
How rare is that one who is blessed with such spiritual wisdom.
Wherever I go, there I see Him. ||1||Pause||
He manifests many forms, while still unmanifest and absolute, and yet He has One Form.
He Himself is the water, and He Himself is the waves. ||2||
He Himself is the temple, and He Himself is selfless service.
He Himself is the worshipper, and He Himself is the idol. ||3||
He Himself is the Yoga; He Himself is the Way.
Nanak's God is forever liberated. ||4||1||6||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
He Himself creates, and He Himself supports.
He Himself causes all to act; He takes no blame Himself. ||1||
He Himself is the teaching, and He Himself is the teacher.
He Himself is the splendor, and He Himself is the experiencer of it. ||1||Pause||
He Himself is silent, and He Himself is the speaker.
He Himself is undeceivable; He cannot be deceived. ||2||
He Himself is hidden, and He Himself is manifest.
He Himself is in each and every heart; He Himself is unattached. ||3||
He Himself is absolute, and He Himself is with the Universe.
Says Nanak, all are beggars of God. ||4||2||7||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
He places the one who strays back on the Path;
such a Guru is found by great good fortune. ||1||
Meditate, contemplate the Name of the Lord, O mind.
The Beloved Feet of the Guru abide within my heart. ||1||Pause||
