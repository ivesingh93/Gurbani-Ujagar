Perfect destiny is inscribed upon your forehead and face; sing the Praises of the Lord forever. ||1||Pause||
The Lord bestows the Ambrosial Food of the Naam.
Out of millions, only a rare few receive it
- only those who are blessed by God's Glance of Grace. ||1||
Whoever enshrines the Guru's Feet within his mind,
is rid of pain and darkness from within.
The True Lord unites him with Himself. ||2||
So embrace love for the Word of the Guru's Bani.
Here and hereafter, this is your only Support.
The Creator Lord Himself bestows it. ||3||
One whom the Lord inspires to accept His Will,
is a wise and knowing devotee.
Nanak is forever a sacrifice to him. ||4||7||17||7||24||
Prabhaatee, Fourth Mehl, Bibhaas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Through the Guru's Teachings, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord with joyous love and delight; I am enraptured, lovingly attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I drink in the Ambrosial Essence; I am a sacrifice to the Naam. ||1||
The Lord, the Life of the World, is my Breath of Life.
The Lofty and Exalted Lord became pleasing to my heart and my inner being, when the Guru breathed the Mantra of the Lord into my ears. ||1||Pause||
Come, O Saints: let us join together, O Siblings of Destiny; let us meet and chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
How am I to find my God? Please bless me with the Gift of the Lord's Teachings. ||2||
The Lord, Har, Har, abides in the Society of the Saints; joining this Sangat, the Lord's Glories are known.
By great good fortune, the Society of the Saints is found. Through the Guru, the True Guru, I receive the Touch of the Lord God. ||3||
I sing the Glorious Praises of God, my Inaccessible Lord and Master; singing His Praises, I am enraptured.
The Guru has showered His Mercy on servant Nanak; in an instant, He blessed him with the Gift of the Lord's Name. ||4||1||
Prabhaatee, Fourth Mehl:
With the rising of the sun, the Gurmukh speaks of the Lord. All through the night, he dwells upon the Sermon of the Lord.
My God has infused this longing within me; I seek my Lord God. ||1||
My mind is the dust of the feet of the Holy.
The Guru has implanted the Sweet Name of the Lord, Har, Har, within me. I dust the Guru's Feet with my hair. ||1||Pause||
Dark are the days and nights of the faithless cynics; they are caught in the trap of attachment to Maya.
The Lord God does not dwell in their hearts, even for an instant; every hair of their heads is totally tied up in debts. ||2||
Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, wisdom and understanding are obtained, and one is released from the traps of egotism and possessiveness.
The Lord's Name, and the Lord, seem sweet to me. Through the Word of His Shabad, the Guru has made me happy. ||3||
I am just a child; the Guru is the Unfathomable Lord of the World. In His Mercy, He cherishes and sustains me.
I am drowning in the ocean of poison; O God, Guru, Lord of the World, please save Your child, Nanak. ||4||2||
Prabhaatee, Fourth Mehl:
The Lord God showered me with His Mercy for an instant; I sing His Glorious Praises with joyous love and delight.
