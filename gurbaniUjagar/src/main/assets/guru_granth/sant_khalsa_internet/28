The blessing of this human life has been obtained, but still, people do not lovingly focus their thoughts on the Name of the Lord.
Their feet slip, and they cannot stay here any longer. And in the next world, they find no place of rest at all.
This opportunity shall not come again. In the end, they depart, regretting and repenting.
Those whom the Lord blesses with His Glance of Grace are saved; they are lovingly attuned to the Lord. ||4||
They all show off and pretend, but the self-willed manmukhs do not understand.
Those Gurmukhs who are pure of heart-their service is accepted.
They sing the Glorious Praise of the Lord; they read about the Lord each day. Singing the Praise of the Lord, they merge in absorption.
O Nanak, the words of those who are lovingly attuned to the Naam are true forever. ||5||4||37||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Those who meditate single-mindedly on the Naam, and contemplate the Teachings of the Guru,
their faces are forever radiant in the Court of the True Lord.
They drink in the Ambrosial Nectar forever and ever, and they love the True Name. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, the Gurmukhs are honored forever.
They meditate forever on the Lord, Har, Har, and they wash off the filth of egotism. ||1||Pause||
The self-willed manmukhs do not know the Naam. Without the Name, they lose their honor.
They do not savor the Taste of the Shabad; they are attached to the love of duality.
They are worms in the filth of manure. They fall into manure, and into manure they are absorbed. ||2||
Fruitful are the lives of those who walk in harmony with the Will of the True Guru.
Their families are saved; blessed are the mothers who gave birth to them.
By His Will He grants His Grace; those who are so blessed, meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||3||
The Gurmukhs meditate on the Naam; they eradicate selfishness and conceit from within.
They are pure, inwardly and outwardly; they merge into the Truest of the True.
O Nanak, blessed is the coming of those who follow the Guru's Teachings and meditate on the Lord. ||4||5||38||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
The devotees of the Lord have the Wealth and Capital of the Lord; with Guru's Advice, they carry on their trade.
They praise the Name of the Lord forever and ever. The Name of the Lord is their Merchandise and Support.
The Perfect Guru has implanted the Name of the Lord into the Lord's devotees; it is an Inexhaustible Treasure. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, instruct your minds in this way.
O mind, why are you so lazy? Become Gurmukh, and meditate on the Naam. ||1||Pause||
Devotion to the Lord is love for the Lord. The Gurmukh reflects deeply and contemplates.
Hypocrisy is not devotion-speaking words of duality leads only to misery.
Those humble beings who are filled with keen understanding and meditative contemplation-even though they intermingle with others, they remain distinct. ||2||
Those who keep the Lord enshrined within their hearts are said to be the servants of the Lord.
Placing mind and body in offering before the Lord, they conquer and eradicate egotism from within.
Blessed and acclaimed is that Gurmukh, who shall never be defeated. ||3||
Those who receive His Grace find Him. Without His Grace, He cannot be found.
