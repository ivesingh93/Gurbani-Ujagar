Serving the True Guru, one obtains intuitive bliss.
The Lord of the Universe comes to dwell within the heart.
He intuitively practices devotional worship day and night; God Himself practices devotional worship. ||4||
Those who are separated from the True Guru, suffer in misery.
Night and day, they are punished, and they suffer in total agony.
Their faces are blackened, and they do not obtain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. They suffer in sorrow and agony. ||5||
Those who serve the True Guru are very fortunate.
They intuitively enshrine love for the True Lord.
They practice Truth, forever Truth; they are united in Union with the True Lord. ||6||
He alone obtains the Truth, unto whom the True Lord gives it.
His inner being is filled with Truth, and his doubt is dispelled.
The True Lord Himself is the Giver of Truth; he alone obtains the Truth, unto whom He gives it. ||7||
He Himself is the Creator of all.
Only one whom He instructs, understands Him.
He Himself forgives, and grants glorious greatness. He himself unites in His Union. ||8||
Acting egotistically, one loses his life.
Even in the world hereafter, emotional attachment to Maya does not leave him.
In the world hereafter, the Messenger of Death calls him to account, and crushes him like sesame seeds in the oil-press. ||9||
By perfect destiny, one serves the Guru.
If God grants His Grace, then one serves.
The Messenger of Death cannot even approach him, and in the Mansion of the True Lord's Presence, he finds peace. ||10||
They alone find peace, who are pleasing to Your Will.
By perfect destiny, they are attached to the Guru's service.
All glorious greatness rests in Your Hands; he alone obtains it, unto whom You give it. ||11||
Through the Guru, one's inner being is enlightened and illumined.
The wealth of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, comes to dwell in the mind.
The jewel of spiritual wisdom ever illumines the heart, and the darkness of spiritual ignorance is dispelled. ||12||
The blind and ignorant are attached to duality.
The unfortunates are drowned without water, and die.
When they depart from the world, they do not find the Lord's door and home; bound and gagged at Death's door, they suffer in pain. ||13||
Without serving the True Guru, no one finds liberation.
Go ask any spiritual teacher or mediator.
Whoever serves the True Guru is blessed with glorious greatness, and honored in the Court of the True Lord. ||14||
One who serves the True Guru, the Lord merges into Himself.
Cutting away attachment, one lovingly focuses on the True Lord.
The merchants deal forever in Truth; they earn the profit of the Naam. ||15||
The Creator Himself acts, and inspires all to act.
He alone is liberated, who dies in the Word of the Shabad.
O Nanak, the Naam dwells deep within the mind; meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||16||5||19||
Maaroo, Third Mehl:
Whatever You do, is done.
How rare are those who walk in harmony with the Lord's Will.
One who surrenders to the Lord's Will finds peace; he finds peace in the Lord's Will. ||1||
Your Will is pleasing to the Gurmukh.
Practicing Truth, he intuitively finds peace.
Many long to walk in harmony with the Lord's Will; He Himself inspires us to surrender to His Will. ||2||
One who surrenders to Your Will, meets with You, Lord.
