When it pleases the Lord God, he causes us to meet the Gurmukhs; the Hymns of the Guru, the True Guru, are very sweet to their minds.
Very fortunate are the beloved Sikhs of the Guru; through the Lord, they attain the supreme state of Nirvaanaa. ||2||
The Sat Sangat, the True Congregation of the Guru, is loved by the Lord. The Naam, the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is sweet and pleasing to their minds.
One who does not obtain the Association of the True Guru, is a most unfortunate sinner; he is consumed by the Messenger of Death. ||3||
If God, the Kind Master, Himself shows His kindness, then the Lord causes the Gurmukh to merge into Himself.
Servant Nanak chants the Glorious Words of the Guru's Bani; through them, one is absorbed into the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||5||
Goojaree, Fourth Mehl:
One who has found the Lord God through the True Guru, has made the Lord seem so sweet to me, through the His Teachings.
My mind and body have been cooled and soothed, and totally rejuvenated; by great good fortune, I meditate on the Name of the Lord. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, let anyone who can implant the Lord's Name within me, come and meet with me.
Unto my Beloved, I give my mind and body, and my very breath of life. He speaks to me of the sermon of my Lord God. ||1||Pause||
Through the Guru's Teachings, I have obtained courage, faith and the Lord. He keeps my mind focused continually on the Lord, and the Name of the Lord.
The Words of the True Guru's Teachings are Ambrosial Nectar; this Amrit trickles into the mouth of the one who chants them. ||2||
Immaculate is the Naam, which cannot be stained by filth. Through the Guru's Teachings, chant the Naam with love.
That man who has not found the wealth of the Naam is most unfortunate; he dies over and over again. ||3||
The source of bliss, the Life of the world, the Great Giver brings bliss to all who meditate on the Lord.
You are the Great Giver, all beings belong to You. O servant Nanak, You forgive the Gurmukhs, and merge them into Yourself. ||4||6||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Goojaree, Fourth Mehl, Third House:
Mother, father and sons are all made by the Lord;
the relationships of all are established by the Lord. ||1||
I have given up all my strength, O my brother.
The mind and body belong to the Lord, and the human body is entirely under His control. ||1||Pause||
The Lord Himself infuses devotion into His humble devotees.
In the midst of family life, they remain unattached. ||2||
When inner love is established with the Lord,
then whatever one does, is pleasing to my Lord God. ||3||
I do those deeds and tasks which the Lord has set me to;
I do that which He makes me to do. ||4||
Those whose devotional worship is pleasing to my God -
O Nanak, those humble beings center their minds lovingly on the Lord's Name. ||5||1||7||16||
