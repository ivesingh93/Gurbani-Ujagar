I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, forever devoted to You. Your place is incomparably beautiful! ||1||
You cherish and nurture all; You take care of all, and Your shade covers all.
You are the Primal Creator, the God of Nanak; I behold You in each and every heart. ||2||2||4||
Kaydaaraa, Fifth Mehl:
I love the Love of my Beloved.
My mind is intoxicated with delight, and my consciousness is filled with hope; my eyes are drenched with Your Love. ||Pause||
Blessed is that day, that hour, minute and second when the heavy, rigid shutters are opened, and desire is quenched.
Seeing the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, I live. ||1||
What is the method, what is the effort, and what is the service, which inspires me to contemplate You?
Abandon your egotistical pride and attachment; O Nanak, you shall be saved in the Society of the Saints. ||2||3||5||
Kaydaaraa, Fifth Mehl:
Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, Har, Har, Har.
Have Mercy on me, O Life of the World, O Lord of the Universe, that I may chant Your Name. ||Pause||
Please lift me up, God, out of vice and corruption, and attach my mind to the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
Doubt, fear and attachment are eradicated from that person who follows the Guru's Teachings, and gazes on the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. ||1||
Let my mind become the dust of all; may I abandon my egotistical intellect.
Please bless me with Your devotional worship, O Merciful Lord; by great good fortune, O Nanak, I have found the Lord. ||2||4||6||
Kaydaaraa, Fifth Mehl:
Without the Lord, life is useless.
Those who forsake the Lord, and become engrossed in other pleasures - false and useless are the clothes they wear, and the food they eat. ||Pause||
The pleasures of wealth, youth, property and comforts will not stay with you, O mother.
Seeing the mirage, the madman is entangled in it; he is imbued with pleasures that pass away, like the shade of a tree. ||1||
Totally intoxicated with the wine of pride and attachment, he has fallen into the pit of sexual desire and anger.
O Dear God, please be the Help and Support of servant Nanak; please take me by the hand, and uplift me. ||2||5||7||
Kaydaaraa, Fifth Mehl:
Nothing goes along with the mortal, except for the Lord.
He is the Master of the meek, the Lord of Mercy, my Lord and Master, the Master of the masterless. ||Pause||
Children, possessions and the enjoyment of corrupt pleasures do not go along with the mortal on the path of Death.
Singing the Glorious Praises of the treasure of the Naam, and the Lord of the Universe, the mortal is carried across the deep ocean. ||1||
In the Sanctuary of the All-powerful, Indescribable, Unfathomable Lord, meditate in remembrance on Him, and your pains shall vanish.
Nanak longs for the dust of the feet of the Lord's humble servant; he shall obtain it only if such pre-ordained destiny is written on his forehead. ||2||6||8||
Kaydaaraa, Fifth Mehl, Fifth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
I do not forget the Lord in my mind.
This love has now become very strong; it has burnt away other corruption. ||Pause||
How can the rainbird forsake the rain-drop? The fish cannot survive without water, even for an instant.
