God's Holy people are the saviors of the world; I grab hold of the hem of their robes.
Bless me, O God, with the gift of the dust of the feet of the Saints. ||2||
I have no skill or wisdom at all, nor any work to my credit.
Please, protect me from doubt, fear and emotional attachment, and cut away the noose of Death from my neck. ||3||
I beg of You, O Lord of Mercy, O my Father, please cherish me!
I sing Your Glorious Praises, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O Lord, Home of peace. ||4||11||41||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Whatever You wish, You do. Without You, there is nothing.
Gazing upon Your Glory, the Messenger of Death leaves and goes away. ||1||
By Your Grace, one is emancipated, and egotism is dispelled.
God is omnipotent, possessing all powers; He is obtained through the Perfect, Divine Guru. ||1||Pause||
Searching, searching, searching - without the Naam, everything is false.
All the comforts of life are found in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; God is the Fulfiller of desires. ||2||
Whatever You attach me to, to that I am attached; I have burnt away all my cleverness.
You are permeating and pervading everywhere, O my Lord, Merciful to the meek. ||3||
I ask for everything from You, but only the very fortunate ones obtain it.
This is Nanak's prayer, O God, I live by singing Your Glorious Praises. ||4||12||42||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Dwelling in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, all sins are erased.
One who is attuned to the Love of God, is not cast into the womb of reincarnation. ||1||
Chanting the Name of the Lord of the Universe, the tongue becomes holy.
The mind and body become immaculate and pure, chanting the Chant of the Guru. ||1||Pause||
Tasting the subtle essence of the Lord, one is satisfied; receiving this essence, the mind becomes happy.
The intellect is brightened and illuminated; turning away from the world, the heart-lotus blossoms forth. ||2||
He is cooled and soothed, peaceful and content; all his thirst is quenched.
The mind's wandering in the ten directions is stopped, and one dwells in the immaculate place. ||3||
The Savior Lord saves him, and his doubts are burnt to ashes.
Nanak is blessed with the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. He finds peace, gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Saints' Darshan. ||4||13||43||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Carry water for the Lord's slave, wave the fan over him, and grind his corn; then, you shall be happy.
Burn in the fire your power, property and authority. ||1||
Grasp hold of the feet of the servant of the humble Saints.
Renounce and abandon the wealthy, the regal overlords and kings. ||1||Pause||
The dry bread of the Saints is equal to all treasures.
The thirty-six tasty dishes of the faithless cynic, are just like poison. ||2||
Wearing the old blankets of the humble devotees, one is not naked.
But by putting on the silk clothes of the faithless cynic, one loses one's honor. ||3||
Friendship with the faithless cynic breaks down mid-way.
But whoever serves the humble servants of the Lord, is emancipated here and hereafter. ||4||
Everything comes from You, O Lord; You Yourself created the creation.
Blessed with the Blessed Vision of the Darshan of the Holy, Nanak sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||5||14||44||
