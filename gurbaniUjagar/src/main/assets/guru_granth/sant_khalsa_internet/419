Why do the Yogis, the revelers, and the beggars wander in foreign lands?
They do not understand the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and the essence of excellence within them. ||3||
The Pandits, the religious scholars, the teachers and astrologers, and those who endlessly read the Puraanas,
do not know what is within; God is hidden deep within them. ||4||
Some penitents perform penance in the forests, and some dwell forever at sacred shrines.
The unenlightened people do not understand themselves - why have they become renunciates? ||5||
Some control their sexual energy, and are known as celibates.
But without the Guru's Word, they are not saved, and they wander in reincarnation. ||6||
Some are householders, servants, and seekers, attached to the Guru's Teachings.
They hold fast to the Naam, to charity, to cleansing and purification; they remain awake in devotion to the Lord. ||7||
Through the Guru, the Gate of the Lord's Home is found, and that place is recognized.
Nanak does not forget the Naam; his mind has surrendered to the True Lord. ||8||14||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
Stilling the desires of the mind, the mortal truly crosses over the terrifying world-ocean.
In the very beginning, and throughout the ages, You have been the Merciful Lord and Master; I seek Your Sanctuary. ||1||
You are the Giver, and I am a mere beggar. Lord, please grant me the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.
The Gurmukh meditates on the Naam; the temple of his mind resounds with joy. ||1||Pause||
Renouncing false greed, one comes to realize the Truth.
So let yourself be absorbed in the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and know this supreme realization. ||2||
This mind is a greedy king, engrossed in greed.
The Gurmukh eliminates his greed, and comes to an understanding with the Lord. ||3||
Planting the seeds in the rocky soil, how can one reap a profit?
The self-willed manmukh is not pleased with Truth; the false are buried in falsehood. ||4||
So renounce greed - you are blind! Greed only brings pain.
When the True Lord dwells within the mind, the poisonous ego is conquered. ||5||
Renounce the evil way of duality, or you shall be plundered, O Siblings of Destiny.
Day and night, praise the Naam, in the Sanctuary of the True Guru's protection. ||6||
The self-willed manmukh is a rock, a stone. His life is cursed and useless.
No matter now long a stone is kept under water, it still remains dry at its core. ||7||
The Name of the Lord is the treasure; the Perfect Guru has given it to me.
O Nanak, one who does not forget the Naam, churns and drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar. ||8||15||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
The travelers travel from one road to another.
The world is engrossed in its entanglements, and does not appreciate the Truth. ||1||
Why wander around, and why go searching, when the Guru's Shabad reveals Him to us?
Leaving behind egotism and attachment, I have arrived at my own home. ||1||Pause||
Through Truth, one meets the True One; He is not obtained through falsehood.
Centering your consciousness on the True Lord, you shall not have to come into the world again. ||2||
Why do you weep for the dead? You do not know how to weep.
Weep by praising the True Lord, and recognize His Command. ||3||
Blessed is the birth of one who is destined to abide by the Lord's Command.
He obtains the true profit, realizing the Lord's Command. ||4||
