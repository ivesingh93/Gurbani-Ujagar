Dhanaasaree, First Mehl, First House, Chau-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:
My soul is afraid; to whom should I complain?
I serve Him, who makes me forget my pains; He is the Giver, forever and ever. ||1||
My Lord and Master is forever new; He is the Giver, forever and ever. ||1||Pause||
Night and day, I serve my Lord and Master; He shall save me in the end.
Hearing and listening, O my dear sister, I have crossed over. ||2||
O Merciful Lord, Your Name carries me across.
I am forever a sacrifice to You. ||1||Pause||
In all the world, there is only the One True Lord; there is no other at all.
He alone serves the Lord, upon whom the Lord casts His Glance of Grace. ||3||
Without You, O Beloved, how could I even live?
Bless me with such greatness, that I may remain attached to Your Name.
There is no other, O Beloved, to whom I can go and speak. ||1||Pause||
I serve my Lord and Master; I ask for no other.
Nanak is His slave; moment by moment, bit by bit, he is a sacrifice to Him. ||4||
O Lord Master, I am a sacrifice to Your Name, moment by moment, bit by bit. ||1||Pause||4||1||
Dhanaasaree, First Mehl:
We are human beings of the briefest moment; we do not know the appointed time of our departure.
Prays Nanak, serve the One, to whom our soul and breath of life belong. ||1||
You are blind - see and consider, how many days your life shall last. ||1||Pause||
My breath, my flesh and my soul are all Yours, Lord; You are so very dear to me.
Nanak, the poet, says this, O True Lord Cherisher. ||2||
If you gave nothing, O my Lord and Master, what could anyone pledge to You?
Nanak prays, we receive that which we are pre-destined to receive. ||3||
The deceitful person does not remember the Lord's Name; he practices only deceit.
When he is marched in chains to Death's door, then, he regrets his actions. ||4||
