This mind listens to the Vedas, the Puraanas, and the ways of the Holy Saints, but it does not sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, for even an instant. ||1||Pause||
Having obtained this human body, so very difficult to obtain, it is now being uselessly wasted.
Emotional attachment to Maya is such a treacherous wilderness, and yet, people are in love with it. ||1||
Inwardly and outwardly, God is always with them, and yet, they do not enshrine Love for Him.
O Nanak, know that those whose hearts are filled with the Lord are liberated. ||2||6||
Gauree, Ninth Mehl:
Holy Saadhus: rest and peace are in the Sanctuary of the Lord.
This is the blessing of studying the Vedas and the Puraanas, that you may meditate on the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Greed, emotional attachment to Maya, possessiveness, the service of evil,
pleasure and pain - those who are not touched by these, are the very embodiment of the Divine Lord. ||1||
Heaven and hell, ambrosial nectar and poison, gold and copper - these are all alike to them.
Praise and slander are all the same to them, as are greed and attachment. ||2||
They are not bound by pleasure and pain - know that they are truly wise.
O Nanak, recognize those mortal beings as liberated, who live this way of life. ||3||7||
Gauree, Ninth Mehl:
O mind, why have you gone crazy?
Don't you know that your life is decreasing, day and night? Your life is made worthless with greed. ||1||Pause||
That body, which you believe to be your own, and your beautiful home and spouse -
none of these is yours to keep. See this, reflect upon it and understand. ||1||
You have wasted the precious jewel of this human life; you do not know the Way of the Lord of the Universe.
You have not been absorbed in the Lord's Feet, even for an instant. Your life has passed away in vain! ||2||
Says Nanak, that man is happy, who sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord's Name.
All the rest of the world is enticed by Maya; they do not obtain the state of fearless dignity. ||3||8||
Gauree, Ninth Mehl:
You people are unconscious; you should be afraid of sin.
Seek the Sanctuary of the Lord, Merciful to the meek, Destroyer of all fear. ||1||Pause||
The Vedas and the Puraanas sing His Praises; enshrine His Name within your heart.
Pure and sublime is the Name of the Lord in the world. Remembering it in meditation, all sinful mistakes shall be washed away. ||1||
You shall not obtain this human body again; make the effort - try to achieve liberation!
Says Nanak, sing of the Lord of compassion, and cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||2||9||251||
Raag Gauree, Ashtapadees, First Mehl: Gauree Gwaarayree:
One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. By Guru's Grace:
The nine treasures and the miraculous spiritual powers come by contemplating the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord.
The Perfect Lord is All-pervading everywhere; He destroys the poison of Maya.
I am rid of the three-phased Maya, dwelling in the Pure Lord.
