False is all his talk of me and you.
The Lord Himself administers the poisonous potion, to mislead and delude.
O Nanak, the karma of past actions cannot be erased. ||2||
Beasts, birds, demons and ghosts -
in these many ways, the false wander in reincarnation.
Wherever they go, they cannot remain there.
They have no place of rest; they rise up again and again and run around.
Their minds and bodies are filled with immense, expansive desires.
The poor wretches are cheated by egotism.
They are filled with countless sins, and are severely punished.
The extent of this cannot be estimated.
Forgetting God, they fall into hell.
There are no mothers there, no siblings, no friends and no spouses.
Those humble beings, unto whom the Lord and Master becomes Merciful,
O Nanak, cross over. ||3||
Rambling and roaming, wandering around, I came to seek the Sanctuary of God.
He is the Master of the meek, the father and mother of the world.
The Merciful Lord God is the Destroyer of sorrow and suffering.
He emancipates whoever He pleases.
He lifts them up and pulls him out of the deep dark pit.
Emancipation comes through loving devotional worship.
The Holy Saint is the very embodiment of the Lord's form.
He Himself saves us from the great fire.
By myself, I cannot practice meditation, austerities, penance and self-discipline.
In the beginning and in the end, God is inaccessible and unfathomable.
Please bless me with Your Name, Lord; Your slave begs only for this.
O Nanak, my Lord God is the Giver of the true state of life. ||4||3||19||
Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:
Why do you try to deceive others, O people of the world? The Fascinating Lord is Merciful to the meek. ||1||
This is what I have come to know.
The brave and heroic Guru, the Generous Giver, gives Sanctuary and preserves our honor. ||1||Pause||
He submits to the Will of His devotees; He is forever and ever the Giver of peace. ||2||
Please bless me with Your Mercy, that I may meditate on Your Name alone. ||3||
Nanak, the meek and humble, begs for the Naam, the Name of the Lord; it eradicates duality and doubt. ||4||4||20||
Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:
My Lord and Master is utterly powerful.
I am just His poor servant. ||1||
My Enticing Beloved is very dear to my mind and my breath of life.
He blesses me with His gift. ||1||Pause||
I have seen and tested all.
There is none other than Him. ||2||
He sustains and nurtures all beings.
He was, and shall always be. ||3||
Please bless me with Your Mercy, O Divine Lord,
and link Nanak to Your service. ||4||5||21||
Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:
The Redeemer of sinners, who carries us across; I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice to Him.
If only I could meet with such a Saint, who would inspire me to meditate on the Lord, Har, Har, Har. ||1||
No one knows me; I am called Your slave.
This is my support and sustenance. ||1||Pause||
You support and cherish all; I am meek and humble - this is my only prayer.
You alone know Your Way; You are the water, and I am the fish. ||2||
O Perfect and Expansive Lord and Master, I follow You in love.
O God, You are pervading all the worlds, solar systems and galaxies. ||3||
