Those who hold tightly to Your Support, God, are happy in Your Sanctuary.
But those humble beings who forget the Primal Lord, the Architect of Destiny, are counted among the most miserable beings. ||2||
One who has faith in the Guru, and who is lovingly attached to God, enjoys the delights of supreme ecstasy.
One who forgets God and forsakes the Guru, falls into the most horrible hell. ||3||
As the Lord engages someone, so he is engaged, and so does he perform.
Nanak has taken to the Shelter of the Saints; his heart is absorbed in the Lord's feet. ||4||4||15||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
As the king is entangled in kingly affairs, and the egotist in his own egotism,
and the greedy man is enticed by greed, so is the spiritually enlightened being absorbed in the Love of the Lord. ||1||
This is what befits the Lord's servant.
Beholding the Lord near at hand, he serves the True Guru, and he is satisfied through the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises. ||Pause||
The addict is addicted to his drug, and the landlord is in love with his land.
As the baby is attached to his milk, so the Saint is in love with God. ||2||
The scholar is absorbed in scholarship, and the eyes are happy to see.
As the tongue savors the tastes, so does the humble servant of the Lord sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||3||
As is the hunger, so is the fulfiller; He is the Lord and Master of all hearts.
Nanak thirsts for the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan; he has met God, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. ||4||5||16||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
We are filthy, and You are immaculate, O Creator Lord; we are worthless, and You are the Great Giver.
We are fools, and You are wise and all-knowing. You are the knower of all things. ||1||
O Lord, this is what we are, and this is what You are.
We are sinners, and You are the Destroyer of sins. Your abode is so beautiful, O Lord and Master. ||Pause||
You fashion all, and having fashioned them, You bless them. You bestow upon them soul, body and the breath of life.
We are worthless - we have no virtue at all; please, bless us with Your gift, O Merciful Lord and Master. ||2||
You do good for us, but we do not see it as good; You are kind and compassionate, forever and ever.
You are the Giver of peace, the Primal Lord, the Architect of Destiny; please, save us, Your children! ||3||
You are the treasure, eternal Lord King; all beings and creatures beg of You.
Says Nanak, such is our condition; please, Lord, keep us on the Path of the Saints. ||4||6||17||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl, Second House:
In our mother's womb, You blessed us with Your meditative remembrance, and You preserved us there.
Through the countless waves of the ocean of fire, please, carry us across and save us, O Savior Lord! ||1||
O Lord, You are the Master above my head.
Here and hereafter, You alone are my Support. ||Pause||
He looks upon the creation like a mountain of gold, and sees the Creator as a blade of grass.
You are the Great Giver, and we are all mere beggars; O God, You give gifts according to Your Will. ||2||
In an instant, You are one thing, and in another instant, You are another. Wondrous are Your ways!
You are beautiful, mysterious, profound, unfathomable, lofty, inaccessible and infinite. ||3||
