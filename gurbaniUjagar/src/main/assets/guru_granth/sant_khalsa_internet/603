Without the Guru, love for the Lord does not well up, O Siblings of Destiny; the self-willed manmukhs are engrossed in the love of duality.
Actions performed by the manmukh are like the threshing of the chaff - they obtain nothing for their efforts. ||2||
Meeting the Guru, the Naam comes to permeate the mind, O Siblings of Destiny, with true love and affection.
He always sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny, with infinite love for the Guru. ||3||
How blessed and approved is his coming into the world, O Siblings of Destiny, who focuses his mind on serving the Guru.
O Nanak, the Name of the Lord is obtained, O Siblings of Destiny, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and we merge with the Lord. ||4||8||
Sorat'h, Third Mehl, First House:
The three worlds are entangled in the three qualities, O Siblings of Destiny; the Guru imparts understanding.
Attached to the Lord's Name, one is emancipated, O Siblings of Destiny; go and ask the wise ones about this. ||1||
O mind, renounce the three qualities, and focus your consciousness on the fourth state.
The Dear Lord abides in the mind, O Siblings of Destiny; ever sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||Pause||
From the Naam, everyone originated, O Siblings of Destiny; forgetting the Naam, they dIE away.
The ignorant world is blind, O Siblings of Destiny; those who sleep are plundered. ||2||
Those Gurmukhs who remain awake are saved, O Siblings of Destiny; they cross over the terrifying world-ocean.
In this world, the Name of the Lord is the true profit, O Siblings of Destiny; keep it enshrined within your heart. ||3||
In the Guru's Sanctuary, O Siblings of Destiny, you shall be saved; be lovingly attuned to the Lord's Name.
O Nanak, the Name of the Lord is the boat, and the Name is the raft, O Siblings of Destiny; setting out on it, the Lord's humble servant crosses over the world-ocean. ||4||9||
Sorat'h, Third Mehl, First House:
The True Guru is the ocean of peace in the world; there is no other place of rest and peace.
The world is afflicted with the painful disease of egotism; dying, only to be reborn, it cries out in pain. ||1||
O mind, serve the True Guru, and obtain peace.
If you serve the True Guru, you shall find peace; otherwise, you shall depart, after wasting away your life in vain. ||Pause||
Led around by the three qualities, he does many deeds, but he does not come to taste and savor the subtle essence of the Lord.
He says his evening prayers, and makes offerings of water, and recites his morning prayers, but without true understanding, he still suffers in pain. ||2||
One who serves the True Guru is very fortunate; as the Lord so wills, he meets with the Guru.
Drinking in the sublime essence of the Lord, His humble servants remain ever satisfied; they eradicate self-conceit from within themselves. ||3||
This world is blind, and all act blindly; without the Guru, no one finds the Path.
O Nanak, meeting with the True Guru, one sees with his eyes, and finds the True Lord within the home of his own being. ||4||10||
Sorat'h, Third Mehl:
Without serving the True Guru, he suffers in terrible pain, and throughout the four ages, he wanders aimlessly.
I am poor and meek, and throughout the ages, You are the Great Giver - please, grant me the understanding of the Shabad. ||1||
O Dear Beloved Lord, please show mercy to me.
Unite me in the Union of the True Guru, the Great Giver, and give me the support of the Lord's Name. ||Pause||
Conquering my desires and duality, I have merged in celestial peace, and I have found the Naam, the Name of the Infinite Lord.
I have tasted the sublime essence of the Lord, and my soul has become immaculately pure; the Lord is the Destroyer of sins. ||2||
