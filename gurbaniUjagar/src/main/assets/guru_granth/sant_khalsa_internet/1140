all his affairs are resolved.
The One Lord is his Protector.
O servant Nanak, no one can equal him. ||4||4||17||
Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
We should feel sad, if God were beyond us.
We should feel sad, if we forget the Lord.
We should feel sad, if we are in love with duality.
But why should we feel sad? The Lord is pervading everywhere. ||1||
In love and attachment to Maya, the mortals are sad, and are consumed by sadness.
Without the Name, they wander and wander and wander, and waste away. ||1||Pause||
We should feel sad, if there were another Creator Lord.
We should feel sad, if someone dies by injustice.
We should feel sad, if something were not known to the Lord.
But why should we feel sad? The Lord is totally permeating everywhere. ||2||
We should feel sad, if God were a tyrant.
We should feel sad, if He made us suffer by mistake.
The Guru says that whatever happens is all by God's Will.
So I have abandoned sadness, and I now sleep without anxiety. ||3||
O God, You alone are my Lord and Master; all belong to You.
According to Your Will, You pass judgment.
There is no other at all; the One Lord is permeating and pervading everywhere.
Please save Nanak's honor; I have come to Your Sanctuary. ||4||5||18||
Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
Without music, how is one to dance?
Without a voice, how is one to sing?
Without strings, how is a guitar to be played?
Without the Naam, all affairs are useless. ||1||
Without the Naam - tell me: who has ever been saved?
Without the True Guru, how can anyone cross over to the other side? ||1||Pause||
Without a tongue, how can anyone speak?
Without ears, how can anyone hear?
Without eyes, how can anyone see?
Without the Naam, the mortal is of no account at all. ||2||
Without learning, how can one be a Pandit - a religious scholar?
Without power, what is the glory of an empire?
Without understanding, how can the mind become steady?
Without the Naam, the whole world is insane. ||3||
Without detachment, how can one be a detached hermit?
Without renouncing egotism, how can anyone be a renunciate?
Without overcoming the five thieves, how can the mind be subdued?
Without the Naam, the mortal regrets and repents forever and ever. ||4||
Without the Guru's Teachings, how can anyone obtain spiritual wisdom?
Without seeing - tell me: how can anyone visualize in meditation?
Without the Fear of God, all speech in useless.
Says Nanak, this is the wisdom of the Lord's Court. ||5||6||19||
Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
Mankind is afflicted with the disease of egotism.
The disease of sexual desire overwhelms the elephant.
Because of the disease of vision, the moth is burnt to death.
Because of the disease of the sound of the bell, the deer is lured to its death. ||1||
Whoever I see is diseased.
Only my True Guru, the True Yogi, is free of disease. ||1||Pause||
Because of the disease of taste, the fish is caught.
Because of the disease of smell, the bumble bee is destroyed.
The whole world is caught in the disease of attachment.
In the disease of the three qualities, corruption is multiplied. ||2||
In disease the mortals die, and in disease they are born.
In disease they wander in reincarnation again and again.
