Soohee, Kabeer Jee, Lallit:
My eyes are exhausted, and my ears are tired of hearing; my beautiful body is exhausted.
Driven forward by old age, all my senses are exhausted; only my attachment to Maya is not exhausted. ||1||
O mad man, you have not obtained spiritual wisdom and meditation.
You have wasted this human life, and lost. ||1||Pause||
O mortal, serve the Lord, as long as the breath of life remains in the body.
And even when your body dies, your love for the Lord shall not die; you shall dwell at the Feet of the Lord. ||2||
When the Word of the Shabad abides deep within, thirst and desire are quenched.
When one understands the Hukam of the Lord's Command, he plays the game of chess with the Lord; throwing the dice, he conquers his own mind. ||3||
Those humble beings, who know the Imperishable Lord and meditate on Him, are not destroyed at all.
Says Kabeer, those humble beings who know how to throw these dice, never lose the game of life. ||4||4||
Soohee, Lalit, Kabeer Jee:
In the one fortress of the body, there are five rulers, and all five demand payment of taxes.
I have not farmed anyone's land, so such payment is difficult for me to pay. ||1||
O people of the Lord, the tax-collector is constantly torturing me!
Raising my arms up, I complained to my Guru, and He has saved me. ||1||Pause||
The nine tax-assessors and the ten magistrates go out; they do not allow their subjects to live in peace.
They do not measure with a full tape, and they take huge amounts in bribes. ||2||
The One Lord is contained in the seventy-two chambers of the body, and He has written off my account.
The records of the Righteous Judge of Dharma have been searched, and I owe absolutely nothing. ||3||
Let no one slander the Saints, because the Saints and the Lord are as one.
Says Kabeer, I have found that Guru, whose Name is Clear Understanding. ||4||5||
Raag Soohee, The Word Of Sree Ravi Daas Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The happy soul-bride knows the worth of her Husband Lord.
Renouncing pride, she enjoys peace and pleasure.
She surrenders her body and mind to Him, and does not remain separate from Him.
She does not see or hear, or speak to another. ||1||
How can anyone know the pain of another,
if there is no compassion and sympathy within? ||1||Pause||
The discarded bride is miserable, and loses both worlds;
she does not worship her Husband Lord.
The bridge over the fire of hell is difficult and treacherous.
No one will accompany you there; you will have to go all alone. ||2||
Suffering in pain, I have come to Your Door, O Compassionate Lord.
I am so thirsty for You, but You do not answer me.
Says Ravi Daas, I seek Your Sanctuary, God;
as You know me, so will You save me. ||3||1||
Soohee:
That day which comes, that day shall go.
You must march on; nothing remains stable.
Our companions are leaving, and we must leave as well.
We must go far away. Death is hovering over our heads. ||1||
