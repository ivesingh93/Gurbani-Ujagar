We bathe at sacred shrines of pilgrimage, and obtain the fruits of peace; not even an iota of filth sticks to us.
this is the Way of Yoga." Luhaareepaa, the disciple of Gorakh says. ||7||
In the stores and on the road, do not sleep; do not let your consciousness covet anyone else's home.
Without the Name, the mind has no firm support; O Nanak, this hunger never departs.
The Guru has revealed the stores and the city within the home of my own heart, where I intuitively carry on the true trade.
Sleep little, and eat little; O Nanak, this is the essence of wisdom". ||8||
Wear the robes of the sect of Yogis who follow Gorakh; put on the ear-rings, begging wallet and patched coat.
Among the twelve schools of Yoga, ours is the highest; among the six schools of philosophy, ours is the best path.
This is the way to instruct the mind, so you will never suffer beatings again.
Nanak speaks: the Gurmukh understands; this is the way that Yoga is attained. ||9||
Let constant absorption in the Word of the Shabad deep within be your ear-rings; eradicate egotism and attachment.
Discard sexual desire, anger and egotism, and through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, attain true understanding.
For your patched coat and begging bowl, see the Lord God pervading and permeating everywhere; O Nanak, the One Lord will carry you across.
True is our Lord and Master, and True is His Name. Analyze it, and you shall find the Word of the Guru to be True. ||10||
Let your mind turn away in detachment from the world, and let this be your begging bowl. Let the lessons of the five elements be your cap.
Let the body be your meditation mat, and the mind your loin cloth.
Let truth, contentment and self-discipline be your companions.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh dwells on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||11||
Who is hidden? Who is liberated?
Who is united, inwardly and outwardly?
Who comes, and who goes?
Who is permeating and pervading the three worlds?" ||12||
He is hidden within each and every heart. The Gurmukh is liberated.
Through the Word of the Shabad, one is united, inwardly and outwardly.
The self-willed manmukh perishes, and comes and goes.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh merges in Truth". ||13||
How is one placed in bondage, and consumed by the serpent of Maya?
How does one lose, and how does one gain?
How does one become immaculate and pure? How is the darkness of ignorance removed?
One who understands this essence of reality is our Guru." ||14||
Man is bound by evil-mindedness, and consumed by Maya, the serpent.
The self-willed manmukh loses, and the Gurmukh gains.
Meeting the True Guru, darkness is dispelled.
O Nanak, eradicating egotism, one merges in the Lord. ||15||
Focused deep within, in perfect absorption,
the soul-swan does not fly away, and the body-wall does not collapse.
Then, one knows that his true home is in the cave of intuitive poise.
O Nanak, the True Lord loves those who are truthful. ||16||
Why have you left your house and become a wandering Udaasee?
Why have you adopted these religious robes?
What merchandise do you trade?
How will you carry others across with you?" ||17||
I became a wandering Udaasee, searching for the Gurmukhs.
I have adopted these robes seeking the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan.
I trade in the merchandise of Truth.
O Nanak, as Gurmukh, I carry others across. ||18||
How have you changed the course of your life?
With what have you linked your mind?
