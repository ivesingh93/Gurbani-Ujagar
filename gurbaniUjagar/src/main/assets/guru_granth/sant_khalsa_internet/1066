Maaroo, Third Mehl:
The Formless Lord created the universe of form.
By the Hukam of His Command, He created attachment to Maya.
The Creator Himself stages all the plays; hearing of the True Lord, enshrine Him in your mind. ||1||
Maya, the mother, gave birth to the three gunas, the three qualities,
and proclaimed the four Vedas to Brahma.
Creating the years, months, days and dates, He infused intelligence into the world. ||2||
Service to the Guru is the most excellent action.
Enshrine the Lord's Name within your heart.
The Word of the Guru's Bani prevails throughout the world; through this Bani, the Lord's Name is obtained. ||3||
He reads the Vedas, but he starts arguments night and day.
He does not remember the Naam, the Name of the Lord; he is bound and gagged by the Messenger of Death.
In the love of duality, he suffers in pain forever; he is deluded by doubt, and confused by the three gunas. ||4||
The Gurmukh is in love with the One Lord alone;
he submerges in his mind the three-phased desire.
Through the True Word of the Shabad, he is liberated forever; he renounces emotional attachment to Maya. ||5||
Those who are so pre-ordained to be imbued, are imbued with love for the Lord.
By Guru's Grace, they are intuitively intoxicated.
Serving the True Guru forever, they find God; He Himself unites them with Himself. ||6||
In attachment to Maya and doubt, the Lord is not found.
Attached to the love of duality, one suffers in pain.
The crimson color lasts for only a few days; all too soon, it fades away. ||7||
So color this mind in the Fear and the Love of God.
Dyed in this color, one merges in the True Lord.
By perfect destiny, some may obtain this color. Through the Guru's Teachings, this color is applied. ||8||
The self-willed manmukhs take great pride in themselves.
In the Court of the Lord, they are never honored.
Attached to duality, they waste their lives; without understanding, they suffer in pain. ||9||
My God has hidden Himself deep within the self.
By Guru's Grace, one is united in the Lord's Union.
God is True, and True is His trade, through which the priceless Naam is obtained. ||10||
No one has found this body's value.
My Lord and Master has worked His handiwork.
One who becomes Gurmukh purifies his body, and then the Lord unites him with Himself. ||11||
Within the body, one loses, and within the body, one wins.
The Gurmukh seeks the self-sustaining Lord.
The Gurmukh trades, and finds peace forever; he intuitively merges in the Celestial Lord. ||12||
True is the Lord's Mansion, and True is His treasure.
The Great Giver Himself gives.
The Gurmukh praises the Giver of peace; his mind is united with the Lord, and he comes to know His worth. ||13||
Within the body is the object; its value cannot be estimated.
He Himself grants glorious greatness to the Gurmukh.
He alone knows this object, to whom this store belongs; the Gurmukh is blessed with it, and does not come to regret. ||14||
The Dear Lord is pervading and permeating all.
By Guru's Grace, He is found.
He Himself unites in His Union; through the Word of the Shabad, one intuitively merges with Him. ||15||
