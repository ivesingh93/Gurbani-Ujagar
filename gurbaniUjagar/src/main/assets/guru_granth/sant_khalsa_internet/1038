The Saam Veda, the Rig Veda, the Jujar Veda and the At'harva Veda
form the mouth of Brahma; they speak of the three gunas, the three qualities of Maya.
None of them can describe His worth. We speak as He inspires us to speak. ||9||
From the Primal Void, He created the seven nether regions.
From the Primal Void, He established this world to lovingly dwell upon Him.
The Infinite Lord Himself created the creation. Everyone acts as You make them act, Lord. ||10||
Your Power is diffused through the three gunas: raajas, taamas and satva.
Through egotism, they suffer the pains of birth and death.
Those blessed by His Grace become Gurmukh; they attain the fourth state, and are liberated. ||11||
From the Primal Void, the ten incarnations welled up.
Creating the Universe, He made the expanse.
He fashioned the demi-gods and demons, the heavenly heralds and celestial musicians; everyone acts according to their past karma. ||12||
The Gurmukh understands, and does not suffer the disease.
How rare are those who understand this ladder of the Guru.
Throughout the ages, they are dedicated to liberation, and so they become liberated; thus they are honored. ||13||
From the Primal Void, the five elements became manifest.
They joined to form the body, which engages in actions.
Both bad and good are written on the forehead, the seeds of vice and virtue. ||14||
The True Guru, the Primal Being, is sublime and detached.
Attuned to the Word of the Shabad, He is intoxicated with the sublime essence of the Lord.
Riches, intellect, miraculous spiritual powers and spiritual wisdom are obtained from the Guru; through perfect destiny, they are received. ||15||
This mind is so in love with Maya.
Only a few are spiritually wise enough to understand and know this.
In hope and desire, egotism and skepticism, the greedy man acts falsely. ||16||
From the True Guru, contemplative meditation is obtained.
And then, one dwells with the True Lord in His celestial home, the Primal State of Absorption in Deepest Samaadhi.
O Nanak, the immaculate sound current of the Naad, and the Music of the Shabad resound; one merges into the True Name of the Lord. ||17||5||17||
Maaroo, First Mehl:
Wherever I look, I see the Lord, merciful to the meek.
God is compassionate; He does not come or go in reincarnation.
He pervades all beings in His mysterious way; the Sovereign Lord remains detached. ||1||
The world is a reflection of Him; He has no father or mother.
He has not acquired any sister or brother.
There is no creation or destruction for Him; He has no ancestry or social status. The Ageless Lord is pleasing to my mind. ||2||
You are the Deathless Primal Being. Death does not hover over Your head.
You are the unseen inaccessible and detached Primal Lord.
You are true and content; the Word of Your Shabad is cool and soothing. Through it, we are lovingly, intuitively attuned to You. ||3||
The three qualities are pervasive; the Lord dwells in His home, the fourth state.
He has made death and birth into a bite of food.
The immaculate Light is the Life of the whole world. The Guru reveals the unstruck melody of the Shabad. ||4||
Sublime and good are those humble Saints, the Beloveds of the Lord.
They are intoxicated with the sublime essence of the Lord, and are carried across to the other side.
Nanak is the dust of the Society of the Saints; by Guru's Grace, he finds the Lord. ||5||
You are the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. All beings belong to You.
