One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Raamkalee, Third Mehl, First House:
In the Golden Age of Sat Yuga, everyone spoke the Truth.
In each and every home, devotional worship was performed by the people, according to the Guru's Teachings.
In that Golden Age, Dharma had four feet.
How rare are those people who, as Gurmukh, contemplate this and understand. ||1||
In all four ages, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is glory and greatness.
One who holds tight to the Naam is liberated; without the Guru, no one obtains the Naam. ||1||Pause||
In the Silver Age of Traytaa Yuga, one leg was removed.
Hypocrisy became prevalent, and people thought that the Lord was far away.
The Gurmukhs still understood and realized;
the Naam abided deep within them, and they were at peace. ||2||
In the Brass Age of Dwaapur Yuga, duality and double-mindedness arose.
Deluded by doubt, they knew duality.
In this Brass Age, Dharma was left with only two feet.
Those who became Gurmukh implanted the Naam deep within. ||3||
In the Iron Age of Kali Yuga, Dharma was left with only one power.
It walks on just one foot; love and emotional attachment to Maya have increased.
Love and emotional attachment to Maya bring total darkness.
If someone meets the True Guru, he is saved, through the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||
Throughout the ages, there is only the One True Lord.
Among all, is the True Lord; there is no other at all.
Praising the True Lord, true peace is attained.
How rare are those, who as Gurmukh, chant the Naam. ||5||
Throughout all the ages, the Naam is the ultimate, the most sublime.
How rare are those, who as Gurmukh, understand this.
One who meditates on the Lord's Name is a humble devotee.
O Nanak, in each and every age, the Naam is glory and greatness. ||6||1||
Raamkalee, Fourth Mehl, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
If someone is very fortunate, and is blessed with great high destiny, then he meditates on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
Chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he finds peace, and merges in the Naam. ||1||
O mortal, as Gurmukh, worship the Lord in devotion forever.
Your heart shall be illumined; through the Guru's Teachings, lovingly attune yourself to the Lord. You shall merge in the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||Pause||
The Great Giver is filled with diamonds, emeralds, rubies and pearls;
one who has good fortune and great destiny inscribed upon his forehead, digs them out, by following the Guru's Teachings. ||2||
The Lord's Name is the jewel, the emerald, the ruby; digging it out, the Guru has placed it in your palm.
The unfortunate, self-willed manmukh does not obtain it; this priceless jewel remains hidden behind a curtain of straw. ||3||
If such pre-ordained destiny is written upon one's forehead, then the True Guru enjoins him to serve Him.
O Nanak, then he obtains the jewel, the gem; blessed, blessed is that one who follows the Guru's Teachings, and finds the Lord. ||4||1||
Raamkalee, Fourth Mehl:
Meeting with the humble servants of the Lord, I am in ecstasy; they preach the sublime sermon of the Lord.
The filth of evil-mindedness is totally washed away; joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, one is blessed with understanding. ||1||
