Doubt and Maya have been removed from within me, and I am merged in the Naam, the True Name of the Lord.
Merged in the True Name of the Lord, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord; meeting my Beloved, I have found peace.
I am in constant bliss, day and night; egotism has been dispelled from within me.
I fall at the feet of those who enshrine the Naam within their consciousness.
The body becomes like gold, when the True Guru unites one with Himself. ||2||
We truly praise the True Lord, when the True Guru imparts understanding.
Without the True Guru, they are deluded by doubt; going to the world hereafter, what face will they display?
What face will they show, when they go there? They will regret and repent for their sins; their actions will bring them only pain and suffering.
Those who are imbued with the Naam are dyed in the deep crimson color of the Lord's Love; they merge into the Being of their Husband Lord.
I can conceive of no other as great as the Lord; unto whom should I go and speak?
We truly praise the True Lord, when the True Guru imparts understanding. ||3||
I fall at the feet of those who praise the Truest of the True.
Those humble beings are true, and immaculately pure; meeting them, all filth is washed off.
Meeting them, all filth is washed off; bathing in the Pool of Truth, one becomes truthful, with intuitive ease.
The True Guru has given me the realization of the Naam, the Immaculate Name of the Lord, the unfathomable, the imperceptible.
Those who perform devotional worship to the Lord night and day, are imbued with His Love; O Nanak, they are absorbed in the True Lord.
I fall at the feet of those who meditate on the Truest of the True. ||4||4||
Vaar Of Wadahans, Fourth Mehl: To Be Sung In The Tune Of Lalaa-Behleemaa:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Shalok, Third Mehl:
The great swans are imbued with the Word of the Shabad; they enshrine the True Name within their hearts.
They gather Truth, remain always in Truth, and love the True Name.
They are always pure and immaculate - filth does not touch them; they are blessed with the Grace of the Creator Lord.
O Nanak, I am a sacrifice to those who, night and day, meditate on the Lord. ||1||
Third Mehl:
I thought that he was a great swan, so I associated with him.
If I had known that he was only a wretched heron from birth, I would not have touched him. ||2||
Third Mehl:
Seeing the swans swimming, the herons became envious.
But the poor herons drowned and died, and floated with their heads down, and their feet above. ||3||
Pauree:
You Yourself are Yourself, all by Yourself; You Yourself created the creation.
You Yourself are Yourself the Formless Lord; there is no other than You.
You are the all-powerful Cause of causes; what You do, comes to be.
You give gifts to all beings, without their asking.
Everyone proclaims, "Waaho! Waaho! Blessed, blessed is the True Guru, who has given the supreme gift of the Name of the Lord. ||1||
