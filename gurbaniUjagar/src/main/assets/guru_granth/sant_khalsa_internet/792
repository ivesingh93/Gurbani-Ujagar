I might as well just die crying, if You will not come into my mind. ||1||
Second Mehl:
When there is peace and pleasure, that is the time to remember your Husband Lord. In times of suffering and pain, remember Him then as well.
Says Nanak, O wise bride, this is the way to meet your Husband Lord. ||2||
Pauree:
I am a worm - how can I praise You, O Lord; Your glorious greatness is so great!
You are inaccessible, merciful and unapproachable; You Yourself unite us with Yourself.
I have no other friend except You; in the end, You alone will be my Companion and Support.
You save those who enter Your Sanctuary.
O Nanak, He is care-free; He has no greed at all. ||20||1||
Raag Soohee, The Word Of Kabeer Jee, And Other Devotees.
Of Kabeer
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Since your birth, what have you done?
You have never even chanted the Name of the Lord. ||1||
You have not meditated on the Lord; what thoughts are you attached to?
What preparations are you making for your death, O unfortunate one? ||1||Pause||
Through pain and pleasure, you have taken care of your family.
But at the time of death, you shall have to endure the agony all alone. ||2||
When you are seized by the neck, then you shall cry out.
Says Kabeer, why didn't you remember the Lord before this? ||3||1||
Soohee, Kabeer Jee:
My innocent soul trembles and shakes.
I do not know how my Husband Lord will deal with me. ||1||
The night of my youth has passed away; will the day of old age also pass away?
My dark hairs, like bumble bees, have gone away, and grey hairs, like cranes, have settled upon my head. ||1||Pause||
Water does not remain in the unbaked clay pot;
when the soul-swan departs, the body withers away. ||2||
I decorate myself like a young virgin;
but how can I enjoy pleasures, without my Husband Lord? ||3||
My arm is tired, driving away the crows.
Says Kabeer, this is the way the story of my life ends. ||4||2||
Soohee, Kabeer Jee:
Your time of service is at its end, and you will have to give your account.
The hard-hearted Messenger of Death has come to take you away.
What have you earned, and what have you lost?
Come immediately! You are summoned to His Court! ||1||
Get going! Come just as you are! You have been summoned to His Court.
The Order has come from the Court of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
I pray to the Messenger of Death: please, I still have some outstanding debts to collect in the village.
I will collect them tonight;
I will also pay you something for your expenses,
and I will recite my morning prayers on the way. ||2||
One who is imbued with the Lord's Love, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy,
blessed, blessed is that most fortunate servant of the Lord.
Here and there, the humble servants of the Lord are always happy.
They win the priceless treasure of this human life. ||3||
When he is awake, he is sleeping, and so he loses this life.
The property and wealth he has accumulated passes on to someone else.
Says Kabeer, those people are deluded,
who forget their Lord and Master, and roll in the dust. ||4||3||
