Pauree:
O mind: without the Lord, whatever you are involved in shall bind you in chains.
The faithless cynic does those deeds which will never allow him to be emancipated.
Acting in egotism, selfishness and conceit, the lovers of rituals carry the unbearable load.
When there is no love for the Naam, then these rituals are corrupt.
The rope of death binds those who are in love with the sweet taste of Maya.
Deluded by doubt, they do not understand that God is always with them.
When their accounts are called for, they shall not be released; their wall of mud cannot be washed clean.
One who is made to understand - O Nanak, that Gurmukh obtains immaculate understanding. ||9||
Shalok:
One whose bonds are cut away joins the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
Those who are imbued with the Love of the One Lord, O Nanak, take on the deep and lasting color of His Love. ||1||
Pauree:
RARRA: Dye this heart of yours in the color of the Lord's Love.
Meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har - chant it with your tongue.
In the Court of the Lord, no one shall speak harshly to you.
Everyone shall welcome you, saying, "Come, and sit down".
In that Mansion of the Lord's Presence, you shall find a home.
There is no birth or death, or destruction there.
One who has such karma written on his forehead,
O Nanak, has the wealth of the Lord in his home. ||10||
Shalok:
Greed, falsehood, corruption and emotional attachment entangle the blind and the foolish.
Bound down by Maya, O Nanak, a foul odor clings to them. ||1||
Pauree:
LALLA: People are entangled in the love of corrupt pleasures;
they are drunk with the wine of egotistical intellect and Maya.
In this Maya, they are born and die.
People act according to the Hukam of the Lord's Command.
No one is perfect, and no one is imperfect.
No one is wise, and no one is foolish.
Wherever the Lord engages someone, there he is engaged.
O Nanak, our Lord and Master is forever detached. ||11||
Shalok:
My Beloved God, the Sustainer of the World, the Lord of the Universe, is deep, profound and unfathomable.
There is no other like Him; O Nanak, He is not worried. ||1||
Pauree:
LALLA: There is no one equal to Him.
He Himself is the One; there shall never be any other.
He is now, He has been, and He shall always be.
No one has ever found His limit.
In the ant and in the elephant, He is totally pervading.
The Lord, the Primal Being, is known by everyone everywhere.
That one, unto whom the Lord has given His Love -
O Nanak, that Gurmukh chants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||12||
Shalok:
One who knows the taste of the Lord's sublime essence, intuitively enjoys the Lord's Love.
O Nanak, blessed, blessed, blessed are the Lord's humble servants; how fortunate is their coming into the world! ||1||
Pauree:
How fruitful is the coming into the world, of those
whose tongues celebrate the Praises of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
They come and dwell with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy;
night and day, they lovingly meditate on the Naam.
Blessed is the birth of those humble beings who are attuned to the Naam;
the Lord, the Architect of Destiny, bestows His Kind Mercy upon them.
They are born only once - they shall not be reincarnated again.
O Nanak, they are absorbed into the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan. ||13||
Shalok:
Chanting it, the mind is filled with bliss; love of duality is eliminated,
and pain, distress and desires are quenched. O Nanak, immerse yourself in the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||
