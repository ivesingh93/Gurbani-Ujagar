He came into the world to obtain the four great blessings.
He came to dwell in the home of the Shiva and Shakti, energy and matter.
But he forgot the One Lord, and he has lost the game. The blind person forgets the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||6||
The child dies in his childish games.
They cry and mourn, saying that he was such a playful child.
The Lord who owns him has taken him back. Those who weep and mourn are mistaken. ||7||
What can they do, if he dies in his youth?
They cry out, "His is mine, he is mine!
They cry for the sake of Maya, and are ruined; their lives in this world are cursed. ||8||
Their black hair eventually turns grey.
Without the Name, they lose their wealth, and then leave.
They are evil-minded and blind - they are totally ruined; they are plundered, and cry out in pain. ||9||
One who understands himself, does not cry.
When he meets the True Guru, then he understands.
Without the Guru, the heavy, hard doors are not opened. Obtaining the Word of the Shabad, one is emancipated. ||10||
The body grows old, and is beaten out of shape.
But he does not meditate on the Lord, His only friend, even at the end.
Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he departs with his face blackened. The false are humiliated in the Court of the Lord. ||11||
Forgetting the Naam, the false ones depart.
Coming and going, dust falls on their heads.
The soul-bride finds no home in her in-laws' home, the world hereafter; she suffers in agony in this world of her parents' home. ||12||
She eats, dresses and plays joyfully,
but without loving devotional worship of the Lord, she dies uselessly.
One who does not distinguish between good and evil, is beaten by the Messenger of Death; how can anyone escape this? ||13||
One who realizes what he has to possess, and what he has to abandon,
associating with the Guru, comes to know the Word of the Shabad, within the home of his own self.
Do not call anyone else bad; follow this way of life. Those who are true are judged to be genuine by the True Lord. ||14||
Without Truth, no one succeeds in the Court of the Lord.
Through the True Shabad, one is robed in honor.
He forgives those with whom He is pleased; they silence their egotism and pride. ||15||
One who realizes the Hukam of God's Command, by the Grace of the Guru,
comes to know the lifestyle of the ages.
O Nanak, chant the Naam, and cross over to the other side. The True Lord will carry you across. ||16||1||7||
Maaroo, First Mehl:
I have no other friend like the Lord.
He gave me body and mind, and infused consciousness into my being.
He cherishes and cares for all beings; He is deep within, the wise, all-knowing Lord. ||1||
The Guru is the sacred pool, and I am His beloved swan.
In the ocean, there are so many jewels and rubies.
The Lord's Praises are pearls, gems and diamonds. Singing His Praises, my mind and body are drenched with His Love. ||2||
The Lord is inaccessible, inscrutable, unfathomable and unattached.
The Lord's limits cannot be found; the Guru is the Lord of the World.
Through the Teachings of the True Guru, the Lord carries us across to the other side. He unites in His Union those who are colored by His Love. ||3||
Without the True Guru, how can anyone be liberated?
He has been the Friend of the Lord, from the very beginning of time, and all throughout the ages.
By His Grace, He grants liberation in His Court; He forgives them for their sins. ||4||
