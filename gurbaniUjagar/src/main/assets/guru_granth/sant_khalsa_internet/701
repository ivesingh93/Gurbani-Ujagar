Jaitsree, Fifth Mehl, Fourth House, Du-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Now, I have found peace, bowing before the Guru.
I have abandoned cleverness, quieted my anxiety, and renounced my egotism. ||1||Pause||
When I looked, I saw that everyone was enticed by emotional attachment; then, I hurried to the Guru's Sanctuary.
In His Grace, the Guru engaged me in the Lord's service, and then, the Messenger of Death gave up pursuing me. ||1||
I swam across the ocean of fire, when I met the Saints, through great good fortune.
O servant Nanak, I have found total peace; my consciousness is attached to the Lord's feet. ||2||1||5||
Jaitsree, Fifth Mehl:
Within my mind, I cherish and meditate on the True Guru.
He has implanted within me spiritual wisdom and the Mantra of the Lord's Name; Dear God has shown mercy to me. ||1||Pause||
Death's noose and its mighty entanglements have vanished, along with the fear of death.
I have come to the Sanctuary of the Merciful Lord, the Destroyer of pain; I am holding tight to the Support of His feet. ||1||
The Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, has assumed the form of a boat, to cross over the terrifying world-ocean.
I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar, and my doubts are shattered; says Nanak, I can bear the unbearable. ||2||2||6||
Jaitsree, Fifth Mehl:
One who has the Lord of the Universe as his help and support
is blessed with all peace, poise and bliss; no afflictions cling to him. ||1||Pause||
He appears to keep company with everyone, but he remains detached, and Maya does not cling to him.
He is absorbed in love of the One Lord; he understands the essence of reality, and he is blessed with wisdom by the True Guru. ||1||
Those whom the Lord and Master blesses with His kindness, compassion and mercy are the sublime and sanctified Saints.
Associating with them, Nanak is saved; with love and exuberant joy, they sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||2||3||7||
Jaitsree, Fifth Mehl:
The Lord of the Universe is my existence, my breath of life, wealth and beauty.
The ignorant are totally intoxicated with emotional attachment; in this darkness, the Lord is the only lamp. ||1||Pause||
Fruitful is the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, O Beloved God; Your lotus feet are incomparably beautiful!
So many times, I bow in reverence to Him, offering my mind as incense to Him. ||1||
Exhausted, I have fallen at Your Door, O God; I am holding tight to Your Support.
Please, lift Your humble servant Nanak up, out of the pit of fire of the world. ||2||4||8||
Jaitsree, Fifth Mehl:
If only someone would unite me with the Lord!
I hold tight to His feet, and utter sweet words with my tongue; I make my breath of life an offering to Him. ||1||Pause||
I make my mind and body into pure little gardens, and irrigate them with the sublime essence of the Lord.
I am drenched with this sublime essence by His Grace, and the powerful hold of Maya's corruption has been broken. ||1||
I have come to Your Sanctuary, O Destroyer of the suffering of the innocent; I keep my consciousness focused on You.
