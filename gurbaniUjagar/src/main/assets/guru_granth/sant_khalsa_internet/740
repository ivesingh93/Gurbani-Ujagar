Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
The angelic beings and demi-gods are not permitted to remain here.
The silent sages and humble servants also must arise and depart. ||1||
Only those who meditate on the Lord, Har, Har, are seen to live on.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, they obtain the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan. ||1||Pause||
Kings, emperors and merchants must die.
Whoever is seen shall be consumed by death. ||2||
Mortal beings are entangled, clinging to false worldly attachments.
And when they must leave them behind, then they regret and grieve. ||3||
O Lord, O treasure of mercy, please bless Nanak with this gift,
that he may chant Your Name, day and night. ||4||8||14||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
You dwell deep within the heart of each and every being.
The entire universe is strung on Your Thread. ||1||
You are my Beloved, the Support of my breath of life.
Beholding You, gazing upon You, my mind blossoms forth. ||1||Pause||
Wandering, wandering, wandering through countless incarnations, I have grown so weary.
Now, I hold tight to the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||2||
You are inaccessible, incomprehensible, invisible and infinite.
Nanak remembers You in meditation, day and night. ||3||9||15||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
What is the use of the glory of Maya?
It disappears in no time at all. ||1||
This is a dream, but the sleeper does not know it.
In his unconscious state, he clings to it. ||1||Pause||
The poor fool is enticed by the great attachments of the world.
Gazing upon them, watching them, he must still arise and depart. ||2||
The Royal Court of His Darbaar is the highest of the high.
He creates and destroys countless beings. ||3||
There has never been any other, and there shall never be.
O Nanak, meditate on the One God. ||4||10||16||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
Meditating, meditating in remembrance on Him, I live.
I wash Your Lotus Feet, and drink in the wash water. ||1||
He is my Lord, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.
My Lord and Master abides with His humble devotees. ||1||Pause||
Hearing, hearing Your Ambrosial Naam, I meditate on it.
Twenty-four hours a day, I sing Your Glorious Praises. ||2||
Beholding, beholding Your divine play, my mind is in bliss.
Your Glorious Virtues are infinite, O God, O Lord of supreme bliss. ||3||
Meditating in remembrance on Him, fear cannot touch me.
Forever and ever, Nanak meditates on the Lord. ||4||11||17||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
Within my heart, I meditate on the Word of the Guru's Teachings.
With my tongue, I chant the Chant of the Lord. ||1||
The image of His vision is fruitful; I am a sacrifice to it.
His Lotus Feet are the Support of the mind, the Support of the very breath of life. ||1||Pause||
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the cycle of birth and death is ended.
To hear the Ambrosial Sermon is the support of my ears. ||2||
I have renounced sexual desire, anger, greed and emotional attachment.
I have enshrined the Naam within myself, with charity, true cleansing and righteous conduct. ||3||
Says Nanak, I have contemplated this essence of reality;
chanting the Name of the Lord, I am carried across. ||4||12||18||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
The sinner is absorbed in greed and emotional attachment.
