I have found the Perfect Guru, through great good fortune; He has given me the Mantra of the Lord's Name, and my mind has become quiet and tranquil. ||1||
O Lord, I am the slave of the True Guru. ||1||Pause||
My forehead has been branded with His brand; I owe such a great debt to the Guru.
He has been so generous and kind to me; He has carried me across the treacherous and terrifying world-ocean. ||2||
Those who do not have love for the Lord within their hearts, harbor only false intentions and goals.
As paper breaks down and dissolves in water, the self-willed manmukh wastes away in arrogant pride. ||3||
I know nothing, and I do not know the future; as the Lord keeps me, so do I stand.
For my failings and mistakes, O Guru, grant me Your Grace; servant Nanak is Your obedient dog. ||4||7||21||59||
Gauree Poorbee, Fourth Mehl:
The body-village is filled to overflowing with sexual desire and anger, which were broken into bits when I met with the Holy Saint.
By pre-ordained destiny, I have met with the Guru. I have entered into the realm of the Lord's Love. ||1||
Greet the Holy Saint with your palms pressed together; this is an act of great merit.
Bow down before Him; this is a virtuous action indeed. ||1||Pause||
The wicked shaaktas, the faithless cynics, do not know the taste of the Lord's sublime essence. The thorn of egotism is embedded deep within them.
The more they walk away, the deeper it sticks into them, and the more they suffer in pain, until finally, the Messenger of Death smashes his club against their heads. ||2||
The humble servants of the Lord are absorbed in the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. The pain of birth and the fear of death are eradicated.
They have obtained the Imperishable Supreme Being, the Transcendent Lord God, and they obtain great honor throughout all the worlds and realms. ||3||
I am poor and meek, God, but I am Yours! Save me, please save me, O Greatest of the Great!
Servant Nanak takes the Sustenance and Support of the Naam. In the Name of the Lord, he enjoys celestial peace. ||4||8||22||60||
Gauree Poorbee, Fourth Mehl:
Within this body-fortress is the Lord, the Sovereign Lord King, but the stubborn ones do not find the taste.
When the Lord, Merciful to the meek, showed His Mercy, I found and tasted it, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||1||
Lovingly focused upon the Guru, the Kirtan of the Lord's Praise has become sweet to me. ||1||Pause||
The Lord, the Supreme Lord God, is Inaccessible and Unfathomable. Those who are committed to the True Guru, the Divine Intermediary, meet the Lord.
Those whose hearts are pleased with the Guru's Teachings - the Lord's Presence is revealed to them. ||2||
The hearts of the self-willed manmukhs are hard and cruel; their inner beings are dark.
Even if the poisonous snake is fed large amounts of milk, it will still yield only poison. ||3||
O Lord God, please unite me with the Holy Guru, so that I might joyfully grind and eat the Shabad.
Servant Nanak is the slave of the Guru; in the Sangat, the Holy Congregation, the bitter becomes sweet. ||4||9||23||61||
Gauree Poorbee, Fourth Mehl:
For the sake of the Lord, Har, Har, I have sold my body to the Perfect Guru.
The True Guru, the Giver, has implanted the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within me. A very blessed and fortunate destiny is recorded upon my forehead. ||1||
Through the Guru's Teachings, I am lovingly centered on the Lord. ||1||Pause||
