When the mortal has good karma, the Guru grants His Grace.
Then this mind is awakened, and the duality of this mind is subdued. ||4||
It is the innate nature of the mind to remain forever detached.
The Detached, Dispassionate Lord dwells within all. ||5||
Says Nanak, one who understands this mystery,
becomes the embodiment of the Primal, Immaculate, Divine Lord God. ||6||5||
Bhairao, Third Mehl:
The world is saved through Name of the Lord.
It carries the mortal across the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||
By Guru's Grace, dwell upon the Lord's Name.
It shall stand by you forever. ||1||Pause||
The foolish self-willed manmukhs do not remember the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Without the Name, how will they cross over? ||2||
The Lord, the Great Giver, Himself gives His Gifts.
Celebrate and praise the Great Giver! ||3||
Granting His Grace, the Lord unites the mortals with the True Guru.
O Nanak, the Naam is enshrined within the heart. ||4||6||
Bhairao, Third Mehl:
All people are saved through the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Those who become Gurmukh are blessed to receive It. ||1||
When the Dear Lord showers His Mercy,
He blesses the Gurmukh with the glorious greatness of the Naam. ||1||Pause||
Those who love the Beloved Name of the Lord
save themselves, and save all their ancestors. ||2||
Without the Name, the self-willed manmukhs go to the City of Death.
They suffer in pain and endure beatings. ||3||
When the Creator Himself gives,
O Nanak, then the mortals receive the Naam. ||4||7||
Bhairao, Third Mehl:
Love of the Lord of the Universe saved Sanak and his brother, the sons of Brahma.
They contemplated the Word of the Shabad, and the Name of the Lord. ||1||
O Dear Lord, please shower me with Your Mercy,
that as Gurmukh, I may embrace love for Your Name. ||1||Pause||
Whoever has true loving devotional worship deep within his being
meets the Lord, through the Perfect Guru. ||2||
He naturally, intuitively dwells within the home of his own inner being.
The Naam abides within the mind of the Gurmukh. ||3||
The Lord, the Seer, Himself sees.
O Nanak, enshrine the Naam within your heart. ||4||8||
Bhairao, Third Mehl:
In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, enshrine the Lord's Name within your heart.
Without the Name, ashes will be blown in your face. ||1||
The Lord's Name is so difficult to obtain, O Siblings of Destiny.
By Guru's Grace, it comes to dwell in the mind. ||1||Pause||
That humble being who seeks the Lord's Name,
receives it from the Perfect Guru. ||2||
Those humble beings who accept the Will of the Lord, are approved and accepted.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they bear the insignia of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||3||
So serve the One, whose power supports the Universe.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh loves the Naam. ||4||9||
Bhairao, Third Mehl:
In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, many rituals are performed.
But it is not the time for them, and so they are of no use. ||1||
In Kali Yuga, the Lord's Name is the most sublime.
As Gurmukh, be lovingly attached to Truth. ||1||Pause||
Searching my body and mind, I found Him within the home of my own heart.
The Gurmukh centers his consciousness on the Lord's Name. ||2||
