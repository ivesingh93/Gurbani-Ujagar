Those who are blessed with the glory of the Lord's Throne - those Gurmukhs are renowned as supreme.
Touching the philosopher's stone, they themselves becomes the philosopher's stone; they become the companions of the Lord, the Guru. ||4||4||12||
Basant, Third Mehl, First House, Du-Tukas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Throughout the months and the seasons, the Lord is always in bloom.
He rejuvenates all beings and creatures.
What can I say? I am just a worm.
No one has found Your beginning or Your end, O Lord. ||1||
Those who serve You, Lord,
obtain the greatest peace; their souls are so divine. ||1||Pause||
If the Lord is merciful, then the mortal is allowed to serve Him.
By Guru's Grace, he remains dead while yet alive.
Night and day, he chants the True Name;
in this way, he crosses over the treacherous world-ocean. ||2||
The Creator created both poison and nectar.
He attached these two fruits to the world-plant.
The Creator Himself is the Doer, the Cause of all.
He feeds all as He pleases. ||3||
O Nanak, when He casts His Glance of Grace,
He Himself bestows His Ambrosial Naam.
Thus, the desire for sin and corruption is ended.
The Lord Himself carries out His Own Will. ||4||1||
Basant, Third Mehl:
Those who are attuned to the True Lord's Name are happy and exalted.
Take pity on me, O God, Merciful to the meek.
Without Him, I have no other at all.
As it pleases His Will, He keeps me. ||1||
The Guru, the Lord, is pleasing to my mind.
I cannot even survive, without the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. But I shall easily unite with the Guru, if He unites me in His Union. ||1||Pause||
The greedy mind is enticed by greed.
Forgetting the Lord, it regrets and repents in the end.
The separated ones are reunited, when they are inspired to serve the Guru.
They are blessed with the Lord's Name - such is the destiny written on their foreheads. ||2||
This body is built of air and water.
The body is afflicted with the terribly painful illness of egotism.
The Gurmukh has the Medicine: singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord's Name.
Granting His Grace, the Guru has cured the illness. ||3||
The four evils are the four rivers of fire flowing through the body.
It is burning in desire, and burning in egotism.
Those whom the Guru protects and saves are very fortunate.
Servant Nanak enshrines the Ambrosial Name of the Lord in his heart. ||4||2||
Basant, Third Mehl:
One who serves the Lord is the Lord's person.
He dwells in intuitive peace, and never suffers in sorrow.
The self-willed manmukhs are dead; the Lord is not within their minds.
They dIE and dIE again and again, and are reincarnated, only to dIE once more. ||1||
They alone are alive, whose minds are filled with the Lord.
They contemplate the True Lord, and are absorbed in the True Lord. ||1||Pause||
Those who do not serve the Lord are far away from the Lord.
They wander in foreign lands, with dust thrown on their heads.
The Lord Himself enjoins His humble servants to serve Him.
They live in peace forever, and have no greed at all. ||2||
