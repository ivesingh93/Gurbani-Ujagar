Dhanaasaree, Fourth Mehl:
The Lord, Har, Har, is the rain-drop; I am the song-bird, crying, crying out for it.
O Lord God, please bless me with Your Mercy, and pour Your Name into my mouth, even if for only an instant. ||1||
Without the Lord, I cannot live for even a second.
Like the addict who dies without his drug, I dIE without the Lord. ||Pause||
You, Lord, are the deepest, most unfathomable ocean; I cannot find even a trace of Your limits.
You are the most remote of the remote, limitless and transcendent; O Lord Master, You alone know Your state and extent. ||2||
The Lord's humble Saints meditate on the Lord; they are imbued with the deep crimson color of the Guru's Love.
Meditating on the Lord, they attain great glory, and the most sublime honor. ||3||
He Himself is the Lord and Master, and He Himself is the servant; He Himself creates His environments.
Servant Nanak has come to Your Sanctuary, O Lord; protect and preserve the honor of Your devotee. ||4||5||
Dhanaasaree, Fourth Mehl:
Tell me, O Siblings of Destiny, the religion for this Dark Age of Kali Yuga. I seek emancipation - how can I be emancipated?
Meditation on the Lord, Har, Har, is the boat, the raft; meditating on the Lord, the swimmer swims across. ||1||
O Dear Lord, protect and preserve the honor of Your humble servant.
O Lord, Har, Har, please make me chant the chant of Your Name; I beg only for Your devotional worship. ||Pause||
The Lord's servants are very dear to the Lord; they chant the Word of the Lord's Bani.
The account of the recording angels, Chitr and Gupt, and the account with the Messenger of Death is totally erased. ||2||
The Saints of the Lord meditate on the Lord in their minds; they join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
The piercing sun of desires has set, and the cool moon has risen. ||3||
You are the Greatest Being, absolutely unapproachable and unfathomable; You created the Universe from Your Own Being.
O God, take pity on servant Nanak, and make him the slave of the slave of Your slaves. ||4||6||
Dhanaasaree, Fourth Mehl, Fifth House, Du-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Enshrine the Lord within your heart, and contemplate Him. Dwell upon Him, reflect upon Him, and chant the Name of the Lord, the Enticer of hearts.
The Lord Master is unseen, unfathomable and unreachable; through the Perfect Guru, He is revealed. ||1||
The Lord is the philosopher's stone, which transforms lead into gold, and sandalwood, while I am just dry wood and iron.
Associating with the Lord, and the Sat Sangat, the Lord's True Congregation, the Lord has transformed me into gold and sandalwood. ||1||Pause||
One may repeat, verbatim, the nine grammars and the six Shaastras, but my Lord God is not pleased by this.
O servant Nanak, meditate forever on the Lord in your heart; this is what pleases my Lord God. ||2||1||7||
