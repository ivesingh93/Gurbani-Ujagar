Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
They wear and eat the gifts from the Lord;
how can laziness help them, O mother? ||1||
Forgetting her Husband Lord, and attaching herself to other affairs,
the soul-bride throws away the precious jewel in exchange for a mere shell. ||1||Pause||
Forsaking God, she is attached to other desires.
But who has gained honor by saluting the slave? ||2||
They consume food and drink, delicious and sublime as ambrosial nectar.
But the dog does not know the One who has bestowed these. ||3||
Says Nanak, I have been unfaithful to my own nature.
Please forgive me, O God, O Searcher of hearts. ||4||76||145||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
I meditate on the Feet of God within my mind.
This is my cleansing bath at all the sacred shrines of pilgrimage. ||1||
Meditate in remembrance on the Lord every day, O my Siblings of Destiny.
Thus, the filth of millions of incarnations shall be taken away. ||1||Pause||
Enshrine the Lord's Sermon within your heart,
and you shall obtain all the desires of your mind. ||2||
Redeemed is the life, death and birth of those,
within whose hearts the Lord God abides. ||3||
Says Nanak, those humble beings are perfect,
who are blessed with the dust of the feet of the Holy. ||4||77||146||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
They eat and wear what they are given, but still, they deny the Lord.
The messengers of the Righteous Judge of Dharma shall hunt them down. ||1||
They are unfaithful to the One, who has given them body and soul.
Through millions of incarnations, for so many lifetimes, they wander lost. ||1||Pause||
Such is the lifestyle of the faithless cynics;
everything they do is evil. ||2||
Who created the soul, breath of life, mind and body,
within their minds, they have forgotten that Lord and Master. ||3||
Their wickedness and corruption have increased - they are recorded in volumes of books.
O Nanak, they are saved only by the Mercy of God, the Ocean of peace. ||4||
O Supreme Lord God, I have come to Your Sanctuary.
Break my bonds, and carry me across, with the Lord's Name. ||1||Second. Pause||78||147||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
For their own advantage, they make God their friend.
He fulfills all their desires, and blesses them with the state of liberation. ||1||
Everyone should make Him such a friend.
No one goes away empty-handed from Him. ||1||Pause||
For their own purposes, they enshrine the Lord in the heart;
all pain, suffering and disease are taken away. ||2||
Their tongues learn the habit of chanting the Lord's Name,
and all their works are brought to perfection. ||3||
So many times, Nanak is a sacrifice to Him;
fruitful is the Blessed Vision, the Darshan, of my Lord of the Universe. ||4||79||148||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Millions of obstacles are removed in an instant,
for those who listen to the Sermon of the Lord, Har, Har, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||1||
They drink in the sublime essence of the Lord's Name, the Ambrosial Elixir.
Meditating on the Lord's Feet, hunger is taken away. ||1||Pause||
The treasure of all happiness, celestial peace and poise,
are obtained by those, whose hearts are filled with the Lord God. ||2||
