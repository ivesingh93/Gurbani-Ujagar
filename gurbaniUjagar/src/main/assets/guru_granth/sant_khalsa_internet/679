Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl, Seventh House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Meditate in remembrance on the One Lord; meditate in remembrance on the One Lord; meditate in remembrance on the One Lord, O my Beloved.
He shall save you from strife, suffering, greed, attachment, and the most terrifying world-ocean. ||Pause||
With each and every breath, each and every instant, day and night, dwell upon Him.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, meditate on Him fearlessly, and enshrine the treasure of His Name in your mind. ||1||
Worship His lotus feet, and contemplate the glorious virtues of the Lord of the Universe.
O Nanak, the dust of the feet of the Holy shall bless you with pleasure and peace. ||2||1||31||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl, Eighth House, Du-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Remembering, remembering, remembering Him in meditation, I find peace; with each and every breath, I dwell upon Him.
In this world, and in the world beyond, He is with me, as my help and support; wherever I go, He protects me. ||1||
The Guru's Word abides with my soul.
It does not sink in water; thieves cannot steal it, and fire cannot burn it. ||1||Pause||
It is like wealth to the poor, a cane for the blind, and mother's milk for the infant.
In the ocean of the world, I have found the boat of the Lord; the Merciful Lord has bestowed His Mercy upon Nanak. ||2||1||32||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
The Lord of the Universe has become kind and merciful; His Ambrosial Nectar permeates my heart.
The nine treasures, riches and the miraculous spiritual powers of the Siddhas cling to the feet of the Lord's humble servant. ||1||
The Saints are in ecstasy everywhere.
Within the home, and outside as well, the Lord and Master of His devotees is totally pervading and permeating everywhere. ||1||Pause||
No one can equal one who has the Lord of the Universe on his side.
The fear of the Messenger of Death is eradicated, remembering Him in meditation; Nanak meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||2||33||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
The rich man gazes upon his riches, and is proud of himself; the landlord takes pride in his lands.
The king believes that the whole kingdom belongs to him; in the same way, the humble servant of the Lord looks upon the support of his Lord and Master. ||1||
When one considers the Lord to be his only support,
then the Lord uses His power to help him; this power cannot be defeated. ||1||Pause||
Renouncing all others, I have sought the Support of the One Lord; I have come to Him, pleading, "Save me, save me!
By the kindness and the Grace of the Saints, my mind has been purified; Nanak sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||2||3||34||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
He alone is called a warrior, who is attached to the Lord's Love in this age.
Through the Perfect True Guru, he conquers his own soul, and then everything comes under his control. ||1||
