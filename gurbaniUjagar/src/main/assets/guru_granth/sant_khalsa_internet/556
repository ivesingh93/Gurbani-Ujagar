As long as there is breath in the body, he does not remember the Lord; what will he do in the world hereafter?
One who remembers the Lord is a spiritual teacher; the ignorant one acts blindly.
O Nanak, whatever one does in this world, determines what he shall receive in the world hereafter. ||1||
Third Mehl:
From the very beginning, it has been the Will of the Lord Master, that He cannot be remembered without the True Guru.
Meeting the True Guru, he realizes that the Lord is permeating and pervading deep within him; he remains forever absorbed in the Lord's Love.
With each and every breath, he constantly remembers the Lord in meditation; not a single breath passes in vain.
His fears of birth and death depart, and he obtains the honored state of eternal life.
O Nanak, He bestows this rank upon that mortal, upon whom He showers His Mercy. ||2||
Pauree:
He Himself is all-wise and all-knowing; He Himself is supreme.
He Himself reveals His form, and He Himself enjoins us to His meditation.
He Himself poses as a silent sage, and He Himself speaks spiritual wisdom.
He does not seem bitter to anyone; He is pleasing to all.
His Praises cannot be described; forever and ever, I am a sacrifice to Him. ||19||
Shalok, First Mehl:
In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, O Nanak, the demons have taken birth.
The son is a demon, and the daughter is a demon; the wife is the chief of the demons. ||1||
First Mehl:
The Hindus have forgotten the Primal Lord; they are going the wrong way.
As Naarad instructed them, they are worshipping idols.
They are blind and mute, the blindest of the blind.
The ignorant fools pick up stones and worship them.
But when those stones themselves sink, who will carry you across? ||2||
Pauree:
Everything is in Your power; You are the True King.
The devotees are imbued with the Love of the One Lord; they have perfect faith in Him.
The Name of the Lord is the ambrosial food; His humble servants eat their fill.
All treasures are obtained - meditative remembrance on the Lord is the true profit.
The Saints are very dear to the Supreme Lord God, O Nanak; the Lord is unapproachable and unfathomable. ||20||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Everything comes by the Lord's Will, and everything goes by the Lord's Will.
If some fool believes that he is the creator, he is blind, and acts in blindness.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh understands the Hukam of the Lord's Command; the Lord showers His Mercy upon him. ||1||
Third Mehl:
He alone is a Yogi, and he alone finds the Way, who, as Gurmukh, obtains the Naam.
In the body-village of that Yogi are all blessings; this Yoga is not obtained by outward show.
O Nanak, such a Yogi is very rare; the Lord is manifest in his heart. ||2||
Pauree:
He Himself created the creatures, and He Himself supports them.
He Himself is seen to be subtle, and He Himself is obvious.
He Himself remains a solitary recluse, and He Himself has a huge family.
Nanak asks for the gift of the dust of the feet of the Saints of the Lord.
I cannot see any other Giver; You alone are the Giver, O Lord. ||21||1|| Sudh||
