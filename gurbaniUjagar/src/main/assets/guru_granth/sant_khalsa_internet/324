Says Kabeer, O Lord, please meet me - this is my very last chance! ||4||2||
Gauree, Kabeer Jee:
When I realize that there is One, and only One Lord,
why then should the people be upset? ||1||
I am dishonored; I have lost my honor.
No one should follow in my footsteps. ||1||Pause||
I am bad, and bad in my mind as well.
I have no partnership with anyone. ||2||
I have no shame about honor or dishonor.
But you shall know, when your own false covering is laid bare. ||3||
Says Kabeer, honor is that which is accepted by the Lord.
Give up everything - meditate, vibrate upon the Lord alone. ||4||3||
Gauree, Kabeer Jee:
If Yoga could be obtained by wandering around naked,
then all the deer of the forest would be liberated. ||1||
What does it matter whether someone goes naked, or wears a deer skin,
if he does not remember the Lord within his soul? ||1||Pause||
If the spiritual perfection of the Siddhas could be obtained by shaving the head,
then why haven't sheep found liberation? ||2||
If someone could save himself by celibacy, O Siblings of Destiny,
why then haven't eunuchs obtained the state of supreme dignity? ||3||
Says Kabeer, listen, O men, O Siblings of Destiny:
without the Lord's Name, who has ever found salvation? ||4||4||
Gauree, Kabeer Jee:
Those who take their ritual baths in the evening and the morning
are like the frogs in the water. ||1||
When people do not love the Lord's Name,
they must all go to the Righteous Judge of Dharma. ||1||Pause||
Those who love their bodies and try different looks,
do not feel compassion, even in dreams. ||2||
The wise men call them four-footed creatures;
the Holy find peace in this ocean of pain. ||3||
Says Kabeer, why do you perform so many rituals?
Renounce everything, and drink in the supreme essence of the Lord. ||4||5||
Gauree, Kabeer Jee:
What use is chanting, and what use is penance, fasting or devotional worship,
to one whose heart is filled with the love of duality? ||1||
O humble people, link your mind to the Lord.
Through cleverness, the four-armed Lord is not obtained. ||Pause||
Set aside your greed and worldly ways.
Set aside sexual desire, anger and egotism. ||2||
Ritual practices bind people in egotism;
meeting together, they worship stones. ||3||
Says Kabeer, He is obtained only by devotional worship.
Through innocent love, the Lord is met. ||4||6||
Gauree, Kabeer Jee:
In the dwelling of the womb, there is no ancestry or social status.
All have originated from the Seed of God. ||1||
Tell me, O Pandit, O religious scholar: since when have you been a Brahmin?
Don't waste your life by continually claiming to be a Brahmin. ||1||Pause||
If you are indeed a Brahmin, born of a Brahmin mother,
then why didn't you come by some other way? ||2||
How is it that you are a Brahmin, and I am of a low social status?
How is it that I am formed of blood, and you are made of milk? ||3||
Says Kabeer, one who contemplates God,
is said to be a Brahmin among us. ||4||7||
Gauree, Kabeer Jee:
