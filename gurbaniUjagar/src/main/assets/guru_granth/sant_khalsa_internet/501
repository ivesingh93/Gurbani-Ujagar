You have spent your life engaged in worldly pursuits; you have not sung the Glorious Praises of the treasure of the Naam. ||1||Pause||
Shell by shell, you accumulate money; in various ways, you work for this.
Forgetting God, you suffer awful pain beyond measure, and you are consumed by the Great Enticer, Maya. ||1||
Show Mercy to me, O my Lord and Master, and do not hold me to account for my actions.
O merciful and compassionate Lord God, ocean of peace, Nanak has taken to Your Sanctuary, Lord. ||2||16||25||
Goojaree, Fifth Mehl:
With your tongue, chant the Lord's Name, Raam, Raam.
Renounce other false occupations, and vibrate forever on the Lord God. ||1||Pause||
The One Name is the support of His devotees; in this world, and in the world hereafter, it is their anchor and support.
In His mercy and kindness, the Guru has given me the divine wisdom of God, and a discriminating intellect. ||1||
The all-powerful Lord is the Creator, the Cause of causes; He is the Master of wealth - I seek His Sanctuary.
Liberation and worldly success come from the dust of the feet of the Holy Saints; Nanak has obtained the Lord's treasure. ||2||17||26||
Goojaree, Fifth Mehl, Fourth House, Chau-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Give up all your clever tricks, and seek the Sanctuary of the Holy Saint.
Sing the Glorious Praises of the Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent Lord. ||1||
O my consciousness, contemplate and adore the Lotus Feet of the Lord.
You shall obtain total peace and salvation, and all troubles shall depart. ||1||Pause||
Mother, father, children, friends and siblings - without the Lord, none of them are real.
Here and hereafter, He is the companion of the soul; He is pervading everywhere. ||2||
Millions of plans, tricks, and efforts are of no use, and serve no purpose.
In the Sanctuary of the Holy, one becomes immaculate and pure, and obtains salvation, through the Name of God. ||3||
God is profound and merciful, lofty and exalted; He gives Sanctuary to the Holy.
He alone obtains the Lord, O Nanak, who is blessed with such pre-ordained destiny to meet Him. ||4||1||27||
Goojaree, Fifth Mehl:
Serve your Guru forever, and chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe.
With each and every breath, worship the Lord, Har, Har, in adoration, and the anxiety of your mind will be dispelled. ||1||
O my mind, chant the Name of God.
You shall be blessed with peace, poise and pleasure, and you shall find the immaculate place. ||1||Pause||
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, redeem your mind, and adore the Lord, twenty-four hours a day.
Sexual desire, anger and egotism will be dispelled, and all troubles shall end. ||2||
The Lord Master is immovable, immortal and inscrutable; seek His Sanctuary.
Worship in adoration the lotus feet of the Lord in your heart, and center your consciousness lovingly on Him alone. ||3||
The Supreme Lord God has shown mercy to me, and He Himself has forgiven me.
The Lord has given me His Name, the treasure of peace; O Nanak, meditate on that God. ||4||2||28||
Goojaree, Fifth Mehl:
By Guru's Grace, I meditate on God, and my doubts are gone.
