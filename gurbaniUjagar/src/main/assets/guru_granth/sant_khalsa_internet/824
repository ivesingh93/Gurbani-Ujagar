What can any wretched creature do to me? The radiance of my God is gloriously great. ||1||
Meditating, meditating, meditating in remembrance, I have found peace; I have enshrined His Lotus Feet within my mind.
Slave Nanak has entered His Sanctuary; there is none above Him. ||2||12||98||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Forever and ever, chant the Name of God.
The pains of old age and death shall not afflict you, and in the Court of the Lord hereafter, your affairs shall be perfectly resolved. ||1||Pause||
So forsake your self-conceit, and ever seek Sanctuary. This treasure is obtained only from the Guru.
The noose of birth and death is snapped; this is the insignia, the hallmark, of the Court of the True Lord. ||1||
Whatever You do, I accept as good. I have eradicated all egotistical pride from my mind.
Says Nanak, I am under His protection; He created the entire Universe. ||2||13||99||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Deep within the nucleus of his mind and body, is God.
He continually sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and always does good for others; his tongue is priceless. ||1||Pause||
All his generations are redeemed and saved in an instant, and the filth of countless incarnations is washed away.
Meditating, meditating in remembrance on God, his Lord and Master, he passes blissfully through the forest of poison. ||1||
I have obtained the boat of God's Feet, to carry me across the terrifying world-ocean.
The Saints, servants and devotees belong to the Lord; Nanak's mind is attached to Him. ||2||14||100||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
I am reassured, gazing upon Your wondrous play.
You are my Lord and Master, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts; You dwell with the Holy Saints. ||1||Pause||
In an instant, our Lord and Master establishes and exalts. From a lowly worm, He creates a king. ||1||
May I never forget You from my heart; slave Nanak prays for this blessing. ||2||15||101||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
The imperishable Lord God is worthy of worship and adoration.
Dedicating my mind and body, I place them before the Lord, the Cherisher of all beings. ||1||Pause||
His Sanctuary is All-powerful; He cannot be described; He is the Giver of peace, the ocean of mercy, supremely compassionate.
Holding him close in His embrace, the Lord protects and saves him, and then even the hot wind cannot touch him. ||1||
Our Merciful Lord and Master is wealth, property and everything to His humble Saints.
Nanak, a beggar, asks for the Blessed Vision of God's Darshan; please, bless him with the dust of the feet of the Saints. ||2||16||102||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is equal to millions of efforts.
Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and the Messenger of Death will be frightened away. ||1||Pause||
To enshrine the Feet of God in one's mind and body, is to perform all sorts of acts of atonement.
Coming and going, doubt and fear have run away, and the sins of countless incarnations are burnt away. ||1||
So become fearless, and vibrate upon the Lord of the Universe. This is true wealth, obtained only by great good fortune.
