The wealth of the self-willed manmukhs is false, and false is their ostentatious display.
They practice falsehood, and suffer terrible pain.
Deluded by doubt, they wander day and night; through birth and death, they lose their lives. ||7||
My True Lord and Master is very dear to me.
The Shabad of the Perfect Guru is my Support.
O Nanak, one who obtains the Greatness of the Naam, looks upon pain and pleasure as one and the same. ||8||10||11||
Maajh, Third Mehl:
The four sources of creation are Yours; the spoken word is Yours.
Without the Name, all are deluded by doubt.
Serving the Guru, the Lord's Name is obtained. Without the True Guru, no one can receive it. ||1||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who focus their consciousness on the Lord.
Through devotion to the Guru, the True One is found; He comes to abide in the mind, with intuitive ease. ||1||Pause||
Serving the True Guru, all things are obtained.
As are the desires one harbors, so are the rewards one receives.
The True Guru is the Giver of all things; through perfect destiny, He is met. ||2||
This mind is filthy and polluted; it does not meditate on the One.
Deep within, it is soiled and stained by the love of duality.
The egotists may go on pilgrimages to holy rivers, sacred shrines and foreign lands, but they only gather more of the dirt of egotism. ||3||
Serving the True Guru, filth and pollution are removed.
Those who focus their consciousness on the Lord remain dead while yet alive.
The True Lord is Pure; no filth sticks to Him. Those who are attached to the True One have their filth washed away. ||4||
Without the Guru, there is only pitch darkness.
The ignorant ones are blind-there is only utter darkness for them.
The maggots in manure do filthy deeds, and in filth they rot and putrefy. ||5||
Serving the Lord of Liberation, liberation is achieved.
The Word of the Shabad eradicates egotism and possessiveness.
So serve the Dear True Lord, night and day. By perfect good destiny, the Guru is found. ||6||
He Himself forgives and unites in His Union.
From the Perfect Guru, the Treasure of the Naam is obtained.
By the True Name, the mind is made true forever. Serving the True Lord, sorrow is driven out. ||7||
He is always close at hand-do not think that He is far away.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, recognize the Lord deep within your own being.
O Nanak, through the Naam, glorious greatness is received. Through the Perfect Guru, the Naam is obtained. ||8||11||12||
Maajh, Third Mehl:
Those who are True here, are True hereafter as well.
That mind is true, which is attuned to the True Shabad.
They serve the True One, and practice Truth; they earn Truth, and only Truth. ||1||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those whose minds are filled with the True Name.
They serve the True One, and are absorbed into the True One, singing the Glorious Praises of the True One. ||1||Pause||
The Pandits, the religious scholars read, but they do not taste the essence.
In love with duality and Maya, their minds wander, unfocused.
The love of Maya has displaced all their understanding; making mistakes, they live in regret. ||2||
But if they should meet the True Guru, then they obtain the essence of reality;
the Name of the Lord comes to dwell in their minds.
