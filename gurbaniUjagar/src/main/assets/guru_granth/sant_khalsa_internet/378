Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Du-Padas:
You have been blessed with this human body.
This is your chance to meet the Lord of the Universe.
Other efforts are of no use to you.
Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, vibrate and meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||
Make the effort, and cross over the terrifying world ocean.
This human life is passing away in vain, in the love of Maya. ||1||Pause||
I have not practiced meditation, penance, self-restraint or righteous living;
I have not served the Holy Saints, and I do not know the Lord, my King.
Says Nanak, my actions are vile and despicable;
O Lord, I seek Your Sanctuary - please, preserve my honor. ||2||29||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Without You, there is no other for me; You alone are in my mind.
You are my Friend and Companion, God; why should my soul be afraid? ||1||
You are my support, You are my hope.
While sitting down or standing up, while sleeping or waking, with every breath and morsel of food, I never forget You. ||1||Pause||
Protect me, please protect me, O God; I have come to Your Sanctuary; the ocean of fire is so horrible.
The True Guru is the Giver of peace to Nanak; I am Your child, O Lord of the World. ||2||30||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The Lord God has saved me, His slave.
My mind has surrendered to my Beloved; my fever has taken poison and died. ||1||Pause||
Cold and heat do not touch me at all, when I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
My consciousness is not affected by the witch, Maya; I take to the Sanctuary of the Lord's Lotus Feet. ||1||
By the Grace of the Saints, the Lord has shown His Mercy to me; He Himself is my Help and Support.
Nanak ever sings the Praises of the Lord, the treasure of excellence; his doubts and pains are eliminated. ||2||31||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
I have taken the medicine of the Name of the Lord.
I have found peace, and the seat of pain has been removed. ||1||
The fever has been broken, by the Teachings of the Perfect Guru.
I am in ecstasy, and all of my sorrows have been dispelled. ||1||Pause||
All beings and creatures obtain peace,
O Nanak, meditating on the Supreme Lord God. ||2||32||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
That time, which the mortal does not wish for, eventually comes.
Without the Lord's Command, how can understanding be understood? ||1||
The body is consumed by water, fire and earth.
But the soul is neither young nor old, O Siblings of Destiny. ||1||Pause||
Servant Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of the Holy.
By Guru's Grace, he has shaken off the fear of death. ||2||33||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Forever and ever, the soul is illumined;
in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, it dwells at the Feet of the Lord. ||1||
Chant the Lord's Name each and every day, O my mind.
You shall find lasting peace, contentment and tranquility, and all your sins shall depart. ||1||Pause||
Says Nanak, one who is blessed with perfect good karma,
meets the True Guru, and obtains the Perfect Supreme Lord God. ||2||34||
Thirty-four Shabads in Second House. ||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
She who has the Lord God as her Friend
