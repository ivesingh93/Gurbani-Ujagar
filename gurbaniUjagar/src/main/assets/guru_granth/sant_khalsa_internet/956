But the Truth does not grow old; and when it is stitched, it is never torn again.
O Nanak, the Lord and Master is the Truest of the True. While we meditate on Him, we see Him. ||1||
First Mehl:
The knife is Truth, and its steel is totally True.
Its workmanship is incomparably beautiful.
It is sharpened on the grindstone of the Shabad.
It is placed in the scabbard of virtue.
If the Shaykh is killed with that,
then the blood of greed will spill out.
One who is slaughtered in this ritualistic way, will be attached to the Lord.
O Nanak, at the Lord's door, he is absorbed into His Blessed Vision. ||2||
First Mehl:
A beautiful dagger hangs by your waist, and you ride such a beautiful horse.
But don't be too proud; O Nanak, you may fall head first to the ground. ||3||
Pauree:
They alone walk as Gurmukh, who receive the Shabad in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation.
Meditating on the True Lord, they become truthful; they carry in their robes the supplies of the Lord's wealth.
The devotees look beautiful, singing the Praises of the Lord; following the Guru's Teachings, they become stable and unchanging.
They enshrine the jewel of contemplation within their minds, and the most sublime Word of the Guru's Shabad.
He Himself unites in His Union; He Himself grants glorious greatness. ||19||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Everyone is filled with hope; hardly anyone is free of hope.
O Nanak, blessed is the birth of one, who remains dead while yet alive. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Nothing is in the hands of hope. How can one become free of hope?
What can this poor being do? The Lord Himself creates confusion. ||2||
Pauree:
Cursed is the life in this world, without the True Name.
God is the Great Giver of givers. His wealth is permanent and unchanging.
That humble being is immaculate, who worships the Lord with each and every breath.
With your tongue, vibrate the One Inaccessible Lord, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.
He is all-pervading everywhere. Nanak is a sacrifice to Him. ||20||
Shalok, First Mehl:
The union between the lake of the True Guru, and the swan of the soul, was pre-ordained from the very beginning, by the Pleasure of the Lord's Will.
The diamonds are in this lake; they are the food of the swans.
The cranes and the ravens may be very wise, but they do not remain in this lake.
They do not find their food there; their food is different.
Practicing Truth, the True Lord is found. False is the pride of the false.
O Nanak, they alone meet the True Guru, who are so pre-destined by the Lord's Command. ||1||
First Mehl:
My Lord and Master is immaculate, as are those who think of Him.
O Nanak, serve Him, who gives to you forever and ever.
O Nanak, serve Him; by serving Him, sorrow is dispelled.
Faults and demerits vanish, and virtues take their place; peace comes to dwell in the mind. ||2||
Pauree:
He Himself is all-pervading; He Himself is absorbed in the profound state of Samaadhi.
He Himself instructs; the Gurmukh is satisfied and fulfilled.
Some, He causes to wander in the wilderness, while others are committed to His devotional worship.
He alone understands, whom the Lord causes to understand; He Himself attaches mortals to His Name.
O Nanak, meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, true greatness is obtained. ||21||1|| Sudh||
