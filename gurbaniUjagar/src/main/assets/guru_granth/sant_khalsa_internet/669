Chant His Praises, learn of the Lord, and serve the True Guru; in this way, meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
In the Court of the Lord, He shall be pleased with you, and you shall not have to enter the cycle of reincarnation again; you shall merge in the Divine Light of the Lord, Har, Har, Har. ||1||
Chant the Name of the Lord, O my mind, and you shall be totally at peace.
The Lord's Praises are the most sublime, the most exalted; serving the Lord, Har, Har, Har, you shall be emancipated. ||Pause||
The Lord, the treasure of mercy, blessed me, and so the Guru blessed me with the Lord's devotional worship; I have come to be in love with the Lord.
I have forgotten my cares and anxieties, and enshrined the Lord's Name in my heart; O Nanak, the Lord has become my friend and companion. ||2||2||8||
Dhanaasaree, Fourth Mehl:
Read about the Lord, write about the Lord, chant the Lord's Name, and sing the Lord's Praises; the Lord will carry you across the terrifying world-ocean.
In your mind, by your words, and within your heart, meditate on the Lord, and He will be pleased. In this way, repeat the Name of the Lord. ||1||
O mind, meditate on the Lord, the Lord of the World.
Join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O friend.
You shall be happy forever, day and night; sing the Praises of the Lord, the Lord of the world-forest. ||Pause||
When the Lord, Har, Har, casts His Glance of Grace, then I made the effort in my mind; meditating on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, I have been emancipated.
Preserve the honor of servant Nanak, O my Lord and Master; I have come seeking Your Sanctuary. ||2||3||9||
Dhanaasaree, Fourth Mehl:
The eighty-four Siddhas, the spiritual masters, the Buddhas, the three hundred thirty million gods and the silent sages, all long for Your Name, O Dear Lord.
By Guru's Grace, a rare few obtain it; upon their foreheads, the pre-ordained destiny of loving devotion is written. ||1||
O mind, chant the Name of the Lord; singing the Lord's Praises is the most exalted activity.
I am forever a sacrifice to those who sing, and hear Your Praises, O Lord and Master. ||Pause||
I seek Your Sanctuary, O Cherisher God, my Lord and Master; whatever You give me, I accept.
O Lord, Merciful to the meek, give me this blessing; Nanak longs for the Lord's meditative remembrance. ||2||4||10||
Dhanaasaree, Fourth Mehl:
All the Sikhs and servants come to worship and adore You; they sing the sublime Bani of the Lord, Har, Har.
Their singing and listening is approved by the Lord; they accept the Order of the True Guru as True, totally True. ||1||
Chant the Lord's Praises, O Siblings of Destiny; the Lord is the sacred shrine of pilgrimage in the terrifying world-ocean.
They alone are praised in the Court of the Lord, O Saints, who know and understand the Lord's sermon. ||Pause||
He Himself is the Guru, and He Himself is the disciple; the Lord God Himself plays His wondrous games.
O servant Nanak, he alone merges with the Lord, whom the Lord Himself merges; all the others are forsaken, but the Lord loves him. ||2||5||11||
Dhanaasaree, Fourth Mehl:
The Lord is the Fulfiller of desires, the Giver of total peace; the Kaamadhaynaa, the wish-fulfilling cow, is in His power.
So meditate on such a Lord, O my soul. Then, you shall obtain total peace, O my mind. ||1||
