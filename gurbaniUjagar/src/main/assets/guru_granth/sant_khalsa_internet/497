His troubles and worries are ended in an instant; O Nanak, he merges in celestial peace. ||4||5||6||
Goojaree, Fifth Mehl:
Whoever I approach to ask for help, I find him full of his own troubles.
One who worships in his heart the Supreme Lord God, crosses over the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||
No one, except the Guru-Lord, can dispel our pain and sorrow.
Forsaking God, and serving another, one's honor, dignity and reputation are decreased. ||1||Pause||
Relatives, relations and family bound through Maya are of no avail.
The Lord's servant, although of lowly birth, is exalted. Associating with him, one obtains the fruits of his mind's desires. ||2||
Through corruption, one may obtain thousands and millions of enjoyments, but even so, his desires are not satisfied through them.
Remembering the Naam, the Name of the Lord, millions of lights appear, and the incomprehensible is understood. ||3||
Wandering and roaming around, I have come to Your Door, Destroyer of fear, O Lord King.
Servant Nanak yearns for the dust of the feet of the Holy; in it, he finds peace. ||4||6||7||
Goojaree, Fifth Mehl, Panch-Pada, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
First, he came to dwell in his mother's womb; leaving it, he came into the world.
Splendid mansions, beautiful gardens and palaces - none of these shall go with him. ||1||
All other greeds of the greedy are false.
The Perfect Guru has given me the Name of the Lord, which my soul has come to treasure. ||1||Pause||
Surrounded by dear friends, relatives, children, siblings and spouse, he laughs playfully.
But when the very last moment arrives, Death seizes him, while they merely look on. ||2||
By continual oppression and exploitation, he accumulates wealth, gold, silver and money,
but the load-bearer gets only paltry wages, while the rest of the money passes on to others. ||3||
He grabs and collects horses, elephants and chariots, and claims them as his own.
But when he sets out on the long journey, they will not go even one step with him. ||4||
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is my wealth; the Naam is my princely pleasure; the Naam is my family and helper.
The Guru has given Nanak the wealth of the Naam; it neither perishes, nor comes or goes. ||5||1||8||
Goojaree, Fifth Mehl, Ti-Padas, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
My sorrows are ended, and I am filled with peace. The fire of desire within me has been quenched.
The True Guru has implanted the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within me; it neither dies, nor goes anywhere. ||1||
Meditating on the Lord, the bonds of Maya are cut away.
When my God becomes kind and compassionate, one joins the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and is emancipated. ||1||Pause||
