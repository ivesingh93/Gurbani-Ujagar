He gathers up that which brings corruption;
leaving them, the fool must depart in an instant. ||5||
He wanders in attachment to Maya.
He acts in accordance with the karma of his past actions.
Only the Creator Himself remains detached.
God is not affected by virtue or vice. ||6||
Please save me, O Merciful Lord of the Universe!
I seek Your Sanctuary, O Perfect Compassionate Lord.
Without You, I have no other place of rest.
Please take pity on me, God, and bless me with Your Name. ||7||
You are the Creator, and You are the Doer.
You are High and Exalted, and You are totally Infinite.
Please be merciful, and attach me to the hem of Your robe.
Slave Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of God. ||8||2||
Basant Kee Vaar, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Meditate on the Lord's Name, and blossom forth in green abundance.
By your high destiny, you have been blessed with this wondrous spring of the soul.
See all the three worlds in bloom, and obtain the Fruit of Ambrosial Nectar.
Meeting with the Holy Saints, peace wells up, and all sins are erased.
O Nanak, remember in meditation the One Name, and you shall never again be consigned to the womb of reincarnation.. ||1||
The five powerful desires are bound down, when you lean on the True Lord.
The Lord Himself leads us to dwell at His Feet. He stands right in our midst.
All sorrows and sicknesses are eradicated, and you become ever-fresh and rejuvenated.
Night and day, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. You shall never again die.
And the One, from whom we came, O Nanak, into Him we merge once again. ||2||
Where do we come from? Where do we live? Where do we go in the end?
All creatures belong to God, our Lord and Master. Who can place a value on Him?
Those who meditate, listen and chant, those devotees are blessed and beautified.
The Lord God is Inaccessible and Unfathomable; there is no other equal to Him.
The Perfect Guru has taught this Truth. Nanak proclaims it to the world. ||3||1||

Wherever I look, I see Him there pervading. ||1||Pause||
The four Vedas blossom forth in duality.
The Simritees blossom forth, along with the Koran and the Bible. ||2||

The Pandits, the Hindu religious scholars, are intoxicated, reading the Puraanas.
The Yogis are intoxicated in Yoga and meditation.
The Sannyaasees are intoxicated in egotism.
The penitents are intoxicated with the mystery of penance. ||1||
All are intoxicated with the wine of Maya; no one is awake and aware.
The thieves are with them, plundering their homes. ||1||Pause||
Suk Dayv and Akrur are awake and aware.
