Touching the philosopher's stone, they themselves become the philosopher's stone; the Dear Lord Himself blesses them with His Mercy. ||2||
Some wear religious robes, and wander around in pride; they lose their life in the gamble. ||3||
Some worship the Lord in devotion, night and day; day and night, they keep the Lord's Name enshrined in their hearts. ||4||
Those who are imbued with Him night and day, are spontaneously intoxicated with Him; they intuitively conquer their ego. ||5||
Without the Fear of God, devotional worship is never performed; through the Love and the Fear of God, devotional worship is embellished. ||6||
The Shabad burns away emotional attachment to Maya, and then one contemplates the essence of spiritual wisdom. ||7||
The Creator Himself inspires us to act; He Himself blesses us with His treasure. ||8||
The limits of His virtues cannot be found; I sing His Praises and contemplate the Word of the Shabad. ||9||
I chant the Lord's Name, and praise my Dear Lord; egotism is eradicated from within me. ||10||
The treasure of the Naam is obtained from the Guru; the treasures of the True Lord are inexhaustible. ||11||
He Himself is pleased with His devotees; by His Grace, He infuses His strength within them. ||12||
They always feel hunger for the True Name; they sing and contemplate the Shabad. ||13||
Soul, body and everything are His; it is so difficult to speak of, and contemplate Him. ||14||
Those humble beings who are attached to the Shabad are saved; they cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||15||
Without the True Lord, no one can cross over; how rare are those who contemplate and understand this. ||16||
We obtain only that which is pre-ordained; receiving the Lord's Shabad, we are embellished. ||17||
Imbued with the Shabad, the body becomes golden, and loves only the True Name. ||18||
The body is then filled to overflowing with Ambrosial Nectar, obtained by contemplating the Shabad. ||19||
Those who seek God, find Him; others burst and die from their own egotism. ||20||
The debaters waste away, while the servants serve, with love and affection for the Guru. ||21||
He alone is a Yogi, who contemplates the essence of spiritual wisdom, and conquers egotism and thirsty desire. ||22||
The True Guru, the Great Giver, is revealed to those upon whom You bestow Your Grace, O Lord. ||23||
Those who do not serve the True Guru, and who are attached to Maya, are drowned; they die in their own egotism. ||24||
As long as there is breath within you, so long you should serve the Lord; then, you will go and meet the Lord. ||25||
Night and day, she remains awake and aware, day and night; she is the darling bride of her Beloved Husband Lord. ||26||
I offer my body and mind in sacrifice to my Guru; I am a sacrifice to Him. ||27||
Attachment to Maya will end and go away; only by contemplating the Shabad will you be saved. ||28||
They are awake and aware, whom the Lord Himself awakens; so contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||29||
O Nanak, those who do not remember the Naam are dead. The devotees live in contemplative meditation. ||30||4||13||
Raamkalee, Third Mehl:
Receiving the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, from the Guru, I remain satisfied and fulfilled. ||1||
O Saints, the Gurmukhs attain the state of liberation.
