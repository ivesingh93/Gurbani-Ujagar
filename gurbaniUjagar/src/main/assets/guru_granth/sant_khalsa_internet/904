Eradicating attachment to Maya, one merges into the Lord.
Meeting with the True Guru, we unite in His Union.
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is a priceless jewel, a diamond.
Attuned to it, the mind is comforted and encouraged. ||2||
The diseases of egotism and possessiveness do not afflict
one who worships the Lord. Fear of the Messenger of Death runs away.
The Messenger of Death, the enemy of the soul, does not touch me at all.
The Immaculate Name of the Lord illuminates my heart. ||3||
Contemplating the Shabad, we become Nirankaari - we come to belong to the Formless Lord God.
Awakening to the Guru's Teachings, evil-mindedness is taken away.
Remaining awake and aware night and day, lovingly focused on the Lord,
one becomes Jivan Mukta - liberated while yet alive. He finds this state deep within himself. ||4||
In the secluded cave, I remain unattached.
With the Word of the Shabad, I have killed the five thieves.
My mind does not waver or go to the home of any other.
I remain intuitively absorbed deep within. ||5||
As Gurmukh, I remain awake and aware, unattached.
Forever detached, I am woven into the essence of reality.
The world is asleep; it dies, and comes and goes in reincarnation.
Without the Word of the Guru's Shabad, it does not understand. ||6||
The unstruck sound current of the Shabad vibrates day and night.
The Gurmukh knows the state of the eternal, unchanging Lord God.
When someone realizes the Shabad, then he truly knows.
The One Lord is permeating and pervading everywhere in Nirvaanaa. ||7||
My mind is intuitively absorbed in the state of deepest Samaadhi;
renouncing egotism and greed, I have come to know the One Lord.
When the disciple's mind accepts the Guru,
O Nanak, duality is eradicated, and he merges in the Lord. ||8||3||
Raamkalee, First Mehl:
You calculate the auspicious days, but you do not understand
that the One Creator Lord is above these auspicious days.
He alone knows the way, who meets the Guru.
When one follows the Guru's Teachings, then he realizes the Hukam of God's Command. ||1||
Do not tell lies, O Pandit; O religious scholar, speak the Truth.
When egotism is eradicated through the Word of the Shabad, then one finds His home. ||1||Pause||
Calculating and counting, the astrologer draws the horoscope.
He studies it and announces it, but he does not understand reality.
Understand, that the Word of the Guru's Shabad is above all.
Do not speak of anything else; it is all just ashes. ||2||
You bathe, wash, and worship stones.
But without being imbued with the Lord, you are the filthiest of the filthy.
Subduing your pride, you shall receive the supreme wealth of God.
The mortal is liberated and emancipated, meditating on the Lord. ||3||
You study the arguments, but do not contemplate the Vedas.
You drown yourself - how will you save your ancestors?
How rare is that person who realizes that God is in each and every heart.
When one meets the True Guru, then he understands. ||4||
Making his calculations, cynicism and suffering afflict his soul.
Seeking the Sanctuary of the Guru, peace is found.
I sinned and made mistakes, but now I seek Your Sanctuary.
The Guru led me to meet the Lord, according to my past actions. ||5||
If one does not enter the Guru's Sanctuary, God cannot be found.
Deluded by doubt, one is born, only to die, and come back again.
Dying in corruption, he is bound and gagged at Death's door.
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is not in his heart, and he does not act according to the Shabad. ||6||
Some call themselves Pandits, religious scholars and spiritual teachers.
Tinged with double-mindedness, they do not find the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.
