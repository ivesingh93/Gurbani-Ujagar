Maalee Gauraa, Fourth Mehl:
All the Siddhas, seekers and silent sages, with their minds full of love, meditate on the Lord.
The Supreme Lord God, my Lord and Master, is limitless; the Guru has inspired me to know the unknowable Lord. ||1||Pause||
I am low, and I commit evil actions; I have not remembered my Sovereign Lord.
The Lord has led me to meet the True Guru; in an instant, He liberated me from bondage. ||1||
Such is the destiny God wrote on my forehead; following the Guru's Teachings, I enshrine love for the Lord.
The Panch Shabad, the five primal sounds, vibrate and resound in the Court of the Lord; meeting the Lord, I sing the songs of joy. ||2||
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the Purifier of sinners; the unfortunate wretches do not like this.
They rot away in the womb of reincarnation; they fall apart like salt in water. ||3||
Please bless me with such understanding, O Inaccessible Lord God, my Lord and Master, that my mind may remain attached to the Guru's feet.
Servant Nanak remains attached to the Name of the Lord; he is merged in the Naam. ||4||3||
Maalee Gauraa, Fourth Mehl:
My mind is addicted to the juice of the Lord's Name.
My heart-lotus has blossomed forth, and I have found the Guru. Meditating on the Lord, my doubts and fears have run away. ||1||Pause||
In the Fear of God, my heart is committed in loving devotion to Him; following the Guru's Teachings, my sleeping mind has awakened.
All my sins have been erased, and I have found peace and tranquility; I have enshrined the Lord within my heart, by great good fortune. ||1||
The self-willed manmukh is like the false color of the safflower, which fades away; its color lasts for only a few days.
He perishes in an instant; he is tormented, and punished by the Righteous Judge of Dharma. ||2||
The Lord's Love, found in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, is absolutely permanent, and colorfast.
The cloth of the body may be torn to shreds, but still, this beautiful color of the Lord's Love does not fade away. ||3||
Meeting with the Blessed Guru, one is dyed in the color of the Lord's Love, imbued with this deep crimson color.
Servant Nanak washes the feet of that humble being, who is attached to the feet of the Lord. ||4||4||
Maalee Gauraa, Fourth Mehl:
O my mind, meditate, vibrate upon the Name of the Lord, the Lord of the World, Har, Har.
My mind and body are merged in the Lord's Name, and through the Guru's Teachings, my intellect is imbued with the Lord, the source of nectar. ||1||Pause||
Follow the Guru's Teachings, and meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. Chant, and meditate, on the beads of the mala of the Lord.
Those who have such destiny inscribed upon their foreheads, meet with the Lord, adorned with garlands of flowers. ||1||
Those who meditate on the Name of the Lord - all their entanglements are ended.
The Messenger of Death does not even approach them; the Guru, the Savior Lord, saves them. ||2||
I am a child; I know nothing at all. The Lord cherishes me, as my mother and father.
I continually put my hands into the fire of Maya, but the Guru saves me; He is merciful to the meek. ||3||
I was filthy, but I have become immaculate. Singing the Lord's Praises, all sins have been burnt to ashes.
My mind is in ecstasy, having found the Guru; servant Nanak is enraptured through the Word of the Shabad. ||4||5||
