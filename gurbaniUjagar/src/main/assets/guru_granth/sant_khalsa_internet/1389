Lust, anger, egotism, jealousy and desire are eliminated by chanting the Name of the Lord.
The merits of cleansing baths, charity, penance, purity and good deeds, are obtained by enshrining the Lotus Feet of God within the heart.
The Lord is my Friend, my Very Best Friend, Companion and Relative. God is the Sustenance of the soul, the Support of the breath of life.
I have grasped the Shelter and Support of my All-powerful Lord and Master; slave Nanak is forever a sacrifice to Him. ||9||
Weapons cannot cut that person who delights in the love of the Lord's Lotus Feet.
Ropes cannot bind that person whose mind is pierced through by the Vision of the Lord's Way.
Fire cannot burn that person who is attached to the dust of the feet of the Lord's humble servant.
Water cannot drown that person whose feet walk on the Lord's Path.
O Nanak, diseases, faults, sinful mistakes and emotional attachment are pierced by the Arrow of the Name. ||1||10||
People are engaged in making all sorts of efforts; they contemplate the various aspects of the six Shaastras.
RÃ¼bbing ashes all over their bodies, they wander around at the various sacred shrines of pilgrimage; they fast until their bodies are emaciated, and braid their hair into tangled messes.
Without devotional worship of the Lord, they all suffer in pain, caught in the tangled web of their love.
They perform worship ceremonies, draw ritual marks on their bodies, cook their own food fanatically, and make pompous shows of themselves in all sorts of ways. ||2||11||20||
