God is the Creator of the body-vessel.
In the Society of the Saints, the dye is produced.
Through the Word of the Lord's Bani, one's reputation becomes immaculate, and the mind is colored by the dye of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||15||
The sixteen powers, absolute perfection and fruitful rewards are obtained,
when the Lord and Master of infinite power is revealed.
The Lord's Name is Nanak's bliss, play and peace; he drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord. ||16||2||9||
Maaroo, Solhas, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
You are my Lord and Master; You have made me Your servant.
My soul and body are all gifts from You.
You are the Creator, the Cause of causes; nothing belongs to me. ||1||
When You sent me, I came into the world.
Whatever is pleasing to Your Will, I do.
Without You, nothing is done, so I am not anxious at all. ||2||
In the world hereafter, the Hukam of Your Command is heard.
In this world, I chant Your Praises, Lord.
You Yourself write the account, and You Yourself erase it; no one can argue with You. ||3||
You are our father; we are all Your children.
We play as You cause us to play.
The wilderness and the path are all made by You. No one can take the wrong path. ||4||
Some remain seated within their homes.
Some wander across the country and through foreign lands.
Some are grass-cutters, and some are kings. Who among these can be called false? ||5||
Who is liberated, and who will land in hell?
Who is worldly, and who is a devotee?
Who is wise, and who is shallow? Who is aware, and who is ignorant? ||6||
By the Hukam of the Lord's Command, one is liberated, and by His Hukam, one falls into hell.
By His Hukam, one is worldly, and by His Hukam, one is a devotee.
By His Hukam, one is shallow, and by His Hukam, one is wise. There is no other side except His. ||7||
You made the ocean vast and huge.
You made some into foolish self-willed manmukhs, and dragged them into hell.
Some are carried across, in the ship of Truth of the True Guru. ||8||
You issue Your Command for this amazing thing, death.
You create all beings and creatures, and absorb them back into Yourself.
You gaze in delight upon the one arena of the world, and enjoy all the pleasures. ||9||
Great is the Lord and Master, and Great is His Name.
He is the Great Giver; Great is His place.
He is inaccessible and unfathomable, infinite and unweighable. He cannot be measured. ||10||
No one else knows His value.
Only You Yourself, O Immaculate Lord, are equal to Yourself.
You Yourself are the spiritual teacher, You Yourself are the One who meditates. You Yourself are the great and immense Being of Truth. ||11||
For so many days, You remained invisible.
For so many days, You were absorbed in silent absorption.
For so many days, there was only pitch darkness, and then the Creator revealed Himself. ||12||
You Yourself are called the God of Supreme Power.
