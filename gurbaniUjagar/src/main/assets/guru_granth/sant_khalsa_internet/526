Deluded by doubt, O Jai Chand,
you have not realized the Lord, the embodiment of supreme bliss. ||1||Pause||
You eat in each and every house, fattening your body; you wear the patched coat and the ear-rings of the beggar, for the sake of wealth.
You apply the ashes of cremation to your body, but without a Guru, you have not found the essence of reality. ||2||
Why bother to chant your spells? Why bother to practice austerities? Why bother to churn water?
Meditate on the Lord of Nirvaanaa, who has created the 8.4 million species of beings. ||3||
Why bother to carry the water-pot, O saffron-robed Yogi? Why bother to visit the sixty-eight holy places of pilgrimage?
Says Trilochan, listen, mortal: you have no corn - what are you trying to thresh? ||4||1||
Goojaree:
At the very last moment, one who thinks of wealth, and dies in such thoughts,
shall be reincarnated over and over again, in the form of serpents. ||1||
O sister, do not forget the Name of the Lord of the Universe. ||Pause||
At the very last moment, he who thinks of women, and dies in such thoughts,
shall be reincarnated over and over again as a prostitute. ||2||
At the very last moment, one who thinks of his children, and dies in such thoughts,
shall be reincarnated over and over again as a pig. ||3||
At the very last moment, one who thinks of mansions, and dies in such thoughts,
shall be reincarnated over and over again as a goblin. ||4||
At the very last moment, one who thinks of the Lord, and dies in such thoughts,
says Trilochan, that man shall be liberated; the Lord shall abide in his heart. ||5||2||
Goojaree, Padas Of Jai Dayv Jee, Fourth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
In the very beginning, was the Primal Lord, unrivalled, the Lover of Truth and other virtues.
He is absolutely wonderful, transcending creation; remembering Him, all are emancipated. ||1||
Dwell only upon the beauteous Name of the Lord,
the embodiment of ambrosial nectar and reality.
Remembering Him in meditation, the fear of birth, old age and death will not trouble you. ||1||Pause||
If you desire to escape the fear of the Messenger of Death, then praise the Lord joyfully, and do good deeds.
In the past, present and future, He is always the same; He is the embodiment of supreme bliss. ||2||
If you seek the path of good conduct, forsake greed, and do not look upon other men's property and women.
Renounce all evil actions and evil inclinations, and hurry to the Sanctuary of the Lord. ||3||
Worship the immaculate Lord, in thought, word and deed.
What is the good of practicing Yoga, giving feasts and charity, and practicing penance? ||4||
Meditate on the Lord of the Universe, the Lord of the Universe, O man; He is the source of all the spiritual powers of the Siddhas.
Jai Dayv has openly come to Him; He is the salvation of all, in the past, present and future. ||5||1||
