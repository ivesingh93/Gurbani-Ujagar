Our All-powerful Lord and Master is the Doer of all, the Cause of all causes.
I am an orphan - I seek Your Sanctuary, God.
All beings and creatures take Your Support.
Be merciful, God, and save me. ||2||
God is the Destroyer of fear, the Remover of pain and suffering.
The angelic beings and silent sages serve Him.
The earth and the sky are in His Power.
All beings eat what You give them. ||3||
O Merciful God, O Searcher of hearts,
please bless Your slave with Your Glance of Grace.
Please be kind and bless me with this gift,
that Nanak may live in Your Name. ||4||10||
Basant, Fifth Mehl:
Loving the Lord, one's sins are taken away.
Meditating on the Lord, one does not suffer at all.
Meditating on the Lord of the Universe, all darkness is dispelled.
Meditating in remembrance on the Lord, the cycle of reincarnation comes to an end. ||1||
The love of the Lord is springtime for me.
I am always with the humble Saints. ||1||Pause||
The Saints have shared the Teachings with me.
Blessed is that country where the devotees of the Lord of the Universe dwell.
But that place where the Lord's devotees are not, is wilderness.
By Guru's Grace, realize the Lord in each and every heart. ||2||
Sing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises, and enjoy the nectar of His Love.
O mortal, you must always restrain yourself from committing sins.
Behold the Creator Lord God near at hand.
Here and hereafter, God shall resolve your affairs. ||3||
I focus my meditation on the Lord's Lotus Feet.
Granting His Grace, God has blessed me with this Gift.
I yearn for the dust of the feet of Your Saints.
Nanak meditates on his Lord and Master, who is ever-present, near at hand. ||4||11||
Basant, Fifth Mehl:
The True Transcendent Lord is always new, forever fresh.
By Guru's Grace, I continually chant His Name.
God is my Protector, my Mother and Father.
Meditating in remembrance on Him, I do not suffer in sorrow. ||1||
I meditate on my Lord and Master, single-mindedly, with love.
I seek the Sanctuary of the Perfect Guru forever. My True Lord and Master hugs me close in His Embrace. ||1||Pause||
God Himself protects His humble servants.
The demons and wicked enemies have grown weary of struggling against Him.
Without the True Guru, there is no place to go.
Wandering through the lands and foreign countries, people only grow tired and suffer in pain. ||2||
The record of their past actions cannot be erased.
They harvest and eat what they have planted.
The Lord Himself is the Protector of His humble servants.
No one can rival the humble servant of the Lord. ||3||
By His own efforts, God protects His slave.
God's Glory is perfect and unbroken.
So sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe with your tongue forever.
Nanak lives by meditating on the Feet of the Lord. ||4||12||
Basant, Fifth Mehl:
Dwelling at the Guru's Feet, pain and suffering go away.
The Supreme Lord God has shown mercy to me.
All my desires and tasks are fulfilled.
Chanting the Lord's Name, Nanak lives. ||1||
How beautiful is that season, when the Lord fills the mind.
Without the True Guru, the world weeps. The faithless cynic comes and goes in reincarnation, over and over again. ||1||Pause||
