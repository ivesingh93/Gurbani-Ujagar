God is known throughout the three worlds. True is the Name of the True One. ||5||
The wife who knows that her Husband Lord is always with her is very beautiful.
The soul-bride is called to the Mansion of the His Presence, and her Husband Lord ravishes her with love.
The happy soul-bride is true and good; she is fascinated by the Glories of her Husband Lord. ||6||
Wandering around and making mistakes, I climb the plateau; having climbed the plateau, I go up the mountain.
But now I have lost my way, and I am wandering around in the forest; without the Guru, I do not understand.
If I wander around forgetting God's Name, I shall continue coming and going in reincarnation, over and over again. ||7||
Go and ask the travelers, how to walk on the Path as His slave.
They know the Lord to be their King, and at the Door to His Home, their way is not blocked.
O Nanak, the One is pervading everywhere; there is no other at all. ||8||6||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
Through the Guru, the Pure One is known, and the human body becomes pure as well.
The Pure, True Lord abides within the mind; He knows the pain of our hearts.
With intuitive ease, a great peace is found, and the arrow of death shall not strike you. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, filth is washed away by bathing in the Pure Water of the Name.
You alone are Perfectly Pure, O True Lord; all other places are filled with filth. ||1||Pause||
The Temple of the Lord is beautiful; it was made by the Creator Lord.
The sun and the moon are lamps of incomparably beautiful light. Throughout the three worlds, the Infinite Light is pervading.
In the shops of the city of the body, in the fortresses and in the huts, the True Merchandise is traded. ||2||
The ointment of spiritual wisdom is the destroyer of fear; through love, the Pure One is seen.
The mysteries of the seen and the unseen are all known, if the mind is kept centered and balanced.
If one finds such a True Guru, the Lord is met with intuitive ease. ||3||
He draws us to His Touchstone, to test our love and consciousness.
The counterfeit have no place there, but the genuine are placed in His Treasury.
Let your hopes and anxieties depart; thus pollution is washed away. ||4||
Everyone begs for happiness; no one asks for suffering.
But in the wake of happiness, there comes great suffering. The self-willed manmukhs do not understand this.
Those who see pain and pleasure as one and the same find peace; they are pierced through by the Shabad. ||5||
The Vedas proclaim, and the words of Vyaasa tell us,
that the silent sages, the servants of the Lord, and those who practice a life of spiritual discipline are attuned to the Naam, the Treasure of Excellence.
Those who are attuned to the True Name win the game of life; I am forever a sacrifice to them. ||6||
Those who do not have the Naam in their mouths are filled with pollution; they are filthy throughout the four ages.
Without loving devotion to God, their faces are blackened, and their honor is lost.
Those who have forgotten the Naam are plundered by evil; they weep and wail in dismay. ||7||
I searched and searched, and found God. In the Fear of God, I have been united in His Union.
Through self-realization, people dwell within the home of their inner being; egotism and desire depart.
O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Name of the Lord are immaculate and radiant. ||8||7||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
Listen, O deluded and demented mind: hold tight to the Guru's Feet.
Chant and meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; death will be afraid of you, and suffering shall depart.
The deserted wife suffers terrible pain. How can her Husband Lord remain with her forever? ||1||
