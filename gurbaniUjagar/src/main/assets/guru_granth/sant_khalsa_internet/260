O Nanak, one who becomes Gurmukh and chants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||46||
Shalok:
Acting in egotism, selfishness and conceit, the foolish, ignorant, faithless cynic wastes his life.
He dies in agony, like one dying of thirst; O Nanak, this is because of the deeds he has done. ||1||
Pauree:
RARRA: Conflict is eliminated in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy;
meditate in adoration on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the essence of karma and Dharma.
When the Beautiful Lord abides within the heart,
conflict is erased and ended.
The foolish, faithless cynic picks arguments -
his heart is filled with corruption and egotistical intellect.
RARRA: For the Gurmukh, conflict is eliminated,
O Nanak, in an instant through the Teachings. ||47||
Shalok:
O mind, grasp the Support of the Holy Saint; give up your clever arguments.
One who has the Guru's Teachings within his mind, O Nanak, has good destiny inscribed upon his forehead. ||1||
Pauree:
SASSA: I have now entered Your Sanctuary, Lord.
I am so tired of reciting the Shaastras, the Simritees and the Vedas.
I searched and searched and searched, and now I have come to realize,
that without meditating on the Lord, there is no emancipation.
With each and every breath, I make mistakes.
You are All-powerful, endless and infinite.
I seek Your Sanctuary - please save me, Merciful Lord!
Nanak is Your child, O Lord of the World. ||48||
Shalok:
When selfishness and conceit are erased, peace comes, and the mind and body are healed.
O Nanak, then He comes to be seen - the One who is worthy of praise. ||1||
Pauree:
KHAKHA: Praise and extol Him on High,
who fills the empty to over-flowing in an instant.
When the mortal being becomes totally humble,
then he meditates night and day on God, the Detached Lord of Nirvaanaa.
If it pleases the Will of our Lord and Master, then He blesses us with peace.
Such is the Infinite, Supreme Lord God.
He forgives countless sins in an instant.
O Nanak, our Lord and Master is merciful forever. ||49||
Shalok:
I speak the Truth - listen, O my mind: take to the Sanctuary of the Sovereign Lord King.
Give up all your clever tricks, O Nanak, and He shall absorb you into Himself. ||1||
Pauree:
SASSA: Give up your clever tricks, you ignorant fool!
God is not pleased with clever tricks and commands.
You may practice a thousand forms of cleverness,
but not even one will go along with you in the end.
Meditate on that Lord, that Lord, day and night.
O soul, He alone shall go along with you.
Those whom the Lord Himself commits to the service of the Holy,
O Nanak, are not afflicted by suffering. ||50||
Shalok:
Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and keeping it in your mind, you shall find peace.
O Nanak, the Lord is pervading everywhere; He is contained in all spaces and interspaces. ||1||
Pauree:
Behold! The Lord God is totally pervading each and every heart.
Forever and ever, the Guru's wisdom has been the Destroyer of pain.
Quieting the ego, ecstasy is obtained. Where the ego does not exist, God Himself is there.
The pain of birth and death is removed, by the power of the Society of the Saints.
Who lovingly enshrine the Name of the Merciful Lord within their hearts,
in the Society of the Saints; He then becomes kind to those.
