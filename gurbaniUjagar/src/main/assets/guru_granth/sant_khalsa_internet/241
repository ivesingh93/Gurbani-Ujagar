The Fascinating and Beauteous Beloved is the Giver of support to all.
I bow low and fall at the Feet of the Guru; if only I could see the Lord! ||3||
I have made many friends, but I am a sacrifice to the One alone.
No one has all virtues; the Lord alone is filled to overflowing with them. ||4||
His Name is chanted in the four directions; those who chant it are embellished with peace.
I seek Your Protection; Nanak is a sacrifice to You. ||5||
The Guru reached out to me, and gave me His Arm; He lifted me up, out of the pit of emotional attachment.
I have won the incomparable life, and I shall not lose it again. ||6||
I have obtained the treasure of all; His Speech is unspoken and subtle.
In the Court of the Lord, I am honored and glorified; I swing my arms in joy. ||7||
Servant Nanak has received the invaluable and incomparable jewel.
Serving the Guru, I cross over the terrifying world-ocean; I proclaim this loudly to all. ||8||12||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Dye yourself in the color of the Lord's Love.
Chant the Name of the One Lord with your tongue, and ask for Him alone. ||1||Pause||
Renounce your ego, and dwell upon the spiritual wisdom of the Guru.
Those who have such pre-ordained destiny, join the Sangat, the Holy Congregation. ||1||
Whatever you see, shall not go with you.
The foolish, faithless cynics are attached - they waste away and die. ||2||
The Name of the Fascinating Lord is all-pervading forever.
Among millions, how rare is that Gurmukh who attains the Name. ||3||
Greet the Lord's Saints humbly, with deep respect.
You shall obtain the nine treasures, and receive infinite peace. ||4||
With your eyes, behold the holy people;
in your heart, sing the treasure of the Naam. ||5||
Abandon sexual desire, anger, greed and emotional attachment.
Thus you shall be rid of both birth and death. ||6||
Pain and darkness shall depart from your home,
when the Guru implants spiritual wisdom within you, and lights that lamp. ||7||
One who serves the Lord crosses over to the other side.
O servant Nanak, the Gurmukh saves the world. ||8||1||13||
Fifth Mehl, Gauree:
Dwelling upon the Lord, Har, Har, and the Guru, the Guru, my doubts have been dispelled.
My mind has obtained all comforts. ||1||Pause||
I was burning, on fire, and the Guru poured water on me; He is cooling and soothing, like the sandalwood tree. ||1||
The darkness of ignorance has been dispelled; the Guru has lit the lamp of spiritual wisdom. ||2||
The ocean of fire is so deep; the Saints have crossed over, in the boat of the Lord's Name. ||3||
I have no good karma; I have no Dharmic faith or purity. But God has taken me by the arm, and made me His own. ||4||
The Destroyer of fear, the Dispeller of pain, the Lover of His Saints - these are the Names of the Lord. ||5||
He is the Master of the masterless, Merciful to the meek, All-powerful, the Support of His Saints. ||6||
I am worthless - I offer this prayer, O my Lord King: "Please, grant me the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan." ||7||
Nanak has come to Your Sanctuary, O my Lord and Master; Your servant has come to Your Door. ||8||2||14||
