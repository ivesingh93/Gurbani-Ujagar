Servant Nanak is drenched with His Fragrance; blessed, blessed is his entire life. ||1||
The Bani of the Lord's Love is the pointed arrow, which has pierced my mind, O Lord King.
Only those who feel the pain of this love, know how to endure it.
Those who die, and remain dead while yet alive, are said to be Jivan Mukta, liberated while yet alive.
O Lord, unite servant Nanak with the True Guru, that he may cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||2||
I am foolish and ignorant, but I have taken to His Sanctuary; may I merge in the Love of the Lord of the Universe, O Lord King.
Through the Perfect Guru, I have obtained the Lord, and I beg for the one blessing of devotion to the Lord.
My mind and body blossom forth through the Word of the Shabad; I meditate on the Lord of infinite waves.
Meeting with the humble Saints, Nanak finds the Lord, in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. ||3||
O Merciful to the meek, hear my prayer, O Lord God; You are my Master, O Lord King.
I beg for the Sanctuary of the Lord's Name, Har, Har; please, place it in my mouth.
It is the Lord's natural way to love His devotees; O Lord, please preserve my honor!
Servant Nanak has entered His Sanctuary, and has been saved by the Name of the Lord. ||4||8||15||
Aasaa, Fourth Mehl:
As Gurmukh, I searched and searched, and found the Lord, my Friend, my Sovereign Lord King.
Within the walled fortress of my golden body, the Lord, Har, Har, is revealed.
The Lord, Har, Har, is a jewel, a diamond; my mind and body are pierced through.
By the great good fortune of pre-ordained destiny, I have found the Lord. Nanak is permeated with His sublime essence. ||1||
I stand by the roadside, and ask the way; I am just a youthful bride of the Lord King.
The Guru has caused me to remember the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; I follow the Path to Him.
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the Support of my mind and body; I have burnt away the poison of ego.
O True Guru, unite me with the Lord, unite me with the Lord, adorned with garlands of flowers. ||2||
O my Love, come and meet me as Gurmukh; I have been separated from You for so long, Lord King.
My mind and body are sad; my eyes are wet with the Lord's sublime essence.
Show me my Lord God, my Love, O Guru; meeting the Lord, my mind is pleased.
I am just a fool, O Nanak, but the Lord has appointed me to perform His service. ||3||
The Guru's body is drenched with Ambrosial Nectar; He sprinkles it upon me, O Lord King.
Those whose minds are pleased with the Word of the Guru's Bani, drink in the Ambrosial Nectar again and again.
As the Guru is pleased, the Lord is obtained, and you shall not be pushed around any more.
The Lord's humble servant becomes the Lord, Har, Har; O Nanak, the Lord and His servant are one and the same. ||4||9||16||
Aasaa, Fourth Mehl:
The treasure of Ambrosial Nectar, the Lord's devotional service, is found through the Guru, the True Guru, O Lord King.
The Guru, the True Guru, is the True Banker, who gives to His Sikh the capital of the Lord.
Blessed, blessed is the trader and the trade; how wonderful is the Banker, the Guru!
O servant Nanak, they alone obtain the Guru, who have such pre-ordained destiny written upon their foreheads. ||1||
You are my True Banker, O Lord; the whole world is Your trader, O Lord King.
You fashioned all vessels, O Lord, and that which dwells within is also Yours.
Whatever You place in that vessel, that alone comes out again. What can the poor creatures do?
