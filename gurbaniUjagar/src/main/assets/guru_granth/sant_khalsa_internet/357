but I do not know whether He will be pleased with me or not. ||2||
How do I know what will happen to me, O my mother?
Without the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, I cannot survive. ||1||Pause||
I have not tasted His Love, and my thirst is not quenched.
My beautiful youth has run away, and now I, the soul-bride, repent and regret. ||3||
Even now, I am held by hope and desire.
I am depressed; I have no hope at all. ||1||Pause||
She overcomes her egotism, and adorns herself;
the Husband Lord now ravishes and enjoys the soul-bride on His Bed. ||4||
Then, O Nanak, the bride becomes pleasing to the Mind of her Husband Lord;
she sheds her self-conceit, and is absorbed in her Lord and Master. ||1||Pause||26||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
In this world of my father's house, I, the soul-bride, have been very childish;
I did not realize the value of my Husband Lord. ||1||
My Husband is the One; there is no other like Him.
If He bestows His Glance of Grace, then I shall meet Him. ||1||Pause||
In the next world of my in-law's house, I, the soul-bride, shall realize Truth;
I shall come to know the celestial peace of my Husband Lord. ||2||
By Guru's Grace, such wisdom comes to me,
so that the soul-bride becomes pleasing to the Mind of the Husband Lord. ||3||
Says Nanak, she who adorns herself with the Love and the Fear of God,
enjoys her Husband Lord forever on His Bed. ||4||27||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
No one is anyone else's son, and no one is anyone else's mother.
Through false attachments, people wander around in doubt. ||1||
O My Lord and Master, I am created by You.
If You give it to me, I will chant Your Name. ||1||Pause||
That person who is filled with all sorts of sins may pray at the Lord's Door,
but he is forgiven only when the Lord so wills. ||2||
By Guru's Grace, evil-mindedness is destroyed.
Wherever I look, there I find the One Lord. ||3||
Says Nanak, if one comes to such an understanding,
then he is absorbed into the Truest of the True. ||4||28||
Aasaa, First Mehl, Du-Padas:
In that pool of the world, the people have their homes; there, the Lord has created water and fire.
In the mud of earthly attachment, their feet have become mired, and I have seen them drowning there. ||1||
O foolish people, why don't you remember the One Lord?
Forgetting the Lord, your virtues shall wither away. ||1||Pause||
I am not a celibate, nor am I truthful, nor a scholar; I was born foolish and ignorant.
Prays Nanak, I seek the Sanctuary of those who do not forget You, Lord. ||2||29||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
There are six systems of philosophy, six teachers, and six doctrines;
but the Teacher of teachers is the One Lord, who appears in so many forms. ||1||
That system, where the Praises of the Creator are sung -
follow that system; in it rests greatness. ||1||Pause||
As the seconds, minutes, hours, days, weekdays, months,
and seasons, all originate from the one sun,
O Nanak, so do all forms originate from the One Creator. ||2||30||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
