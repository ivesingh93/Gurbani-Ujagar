Blessed are Your devotees, who see You, O True Lord.
He alone praises You, who is blessed by Your Grace.
One who meets the Guru, O Nanak, is immaculate and sanctified. ||20||
Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
Fareed, this world is beautiful, but there is a thorny garden within it.
Those who are blessed by their spiritual teacher are not even scratched. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
Fareed, blessed is the life, with such a beautiful body.
How rare are those who are found to love their Beloved Lord. ||2||
Pauree:
He alone obtains meditation, austerities, self-discipline, compassion and Dharmic faith, whom the Lord so blesses.
He alone meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, whose fire the Lord puts out.
The Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, the Inaccessible Primal Lord, inspires us to look upon all with an impartial eye.
With the support of the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, one falls in love with God.
One's faults are eradicated, and one's face becomes radiant and bright; through the Lord's Name, one crosses over.
The fear of birth and death is removed, and he is not reincarnated again.
God lifts him up and pulls him out of the deep, dark pit, and attaches him to the hem of His robe.
O Nanak, God forgives him, and holds him close in His embrace. ||21||
Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
One who loves God is imbued with the deep crimson color of His love.
O Nanak, such a person is rarely found; the value of such a humble person can never be estimated. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
The True Name has pierced the nucleus of my self deep within. Outside, I see the True Lord as well.
O Nanak, He is pervading and permeating all places, the forests and the meadows, the three worlds, and every hair. ||2||
Pauree:
He Himself created the Universe; He Himself imbues it.
He Himself is One, and He Himself has numerous forms.
He Himself is within all, and He Himself is beyond them.
He Himself is known to be far away, and He Himself is right here.
He Himself is hidden, and He Himself is revealed.
No one can estimate the value of Your Creation, Lord.
You are deep and profound, unfathomable, infinite and invaluable.
O Nanak, the One Lord is all-pervading. You are the One and only. ||22||1||2|| Sudh||
Vaar Of Raamkalee, Uttered By Satta And Balwand The Drummer:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
One who chants the Name of the Almighty Creator - how can his words be judged?
His divine virtues are the true sisters and brothers; through them, the gift of supreme status is obtained.
Nanak established the kingdom; He built the true fortress on the strongest foundations.
He installed the royal canopy over Lehna's head; chanting the Lord's Praises, He drank in the Ambrosial Nectar.
The Guru implanted the almighty sword of the Teachings to illuminate his soul.
The Guru bowed down to His disciple, while Nanak was still alive.
The King, while still alive, applied the ceremonial mark to his forehead. ||1||
Nanak proclaimed Lehna's succession - he earned it.
They shared the One Light and the same way; the King just changed His body.
The immaculate canopy waves over Him, and He sits on the throne in the Guru's shop.
He does as the Guru commands; He tasted the tasteless stone of Yoga.
