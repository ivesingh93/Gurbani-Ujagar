Maaroo, First Mehl:
Speak the Truth, and remain in the home of Truth.
Remain dead while yet alive, and cross over the terrifying world-ocean.
The Guru is the boat, the ship, the raft; meditating on the Lord in your mind, you shall be carried across to the other side. ||1||
Eliminating egotism, possessiveness and greed,
one is liberated from the nine gates, and obtains a place in the Tenth Gate.
Lofty and high, the farthest of the far and infinite, He created Himself. ||2||
Receiving the Guru's Teachings, and lovingly attuned to the Lord, one crosses over.
Singing the Praises of the absolute Lord, why should anyone be afraid of death?
Wherever I look, I see only You; I do not sing of any other at all. ||3||
True is the Lord's Name, and True is His Sanctuary.
True is the Word of the Guru's Shabad, grasping it, one is carries across.
Speaking the Unspoken, one sees the Infinite Lord, and then, he does not have to enter the womb of reincarnation again. ||4||
Without the Truth, no one finds sincerity or contentment.
Without the Guru, no one is liberated; coming and going in reincarnation continue.
Chanting the Mool Mantra, and the Name of the Lord, the source of nectar, says Nanak, I have found the Perfect Lord. ||5||
