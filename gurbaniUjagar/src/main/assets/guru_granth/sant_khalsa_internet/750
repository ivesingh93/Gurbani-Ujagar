Your servant is not afraid of anything; the Messenger of Death cannot even approach him. ||1||Pause||
Those who are attuned to Your Love, O my Lord and Master, are released from the pains of birth and death.
No one can erase Your Blessings; the True Guru has given me this assurance. ||2||
Those who meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, obtain the fruits of peace. Twenty-four hours a day, they worship and adore You.
In Your Sanctuary, with Your Support, they subdue the five villains. ||3||
I know nothing about wisdom, meditation and good deeds; I know nothing about Your excellence.
Guru Nanak is the greatest of all; He saved my honor in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga. ||4||10||57||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
Renouncing everything, I have come to the Guru's Sanctuary; save me, O my Savior Lord!
Whatever You link me to, to that I am linked; what can this poor creature do? ||1||
O my Dear Lord God, You are the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.
Be Merciful to me, O Divine, Compassionate Guru, that I may constantly sing the Glorious Praises of my Lord and Master. ||1||Pause||
Twenty-four hours a day, I meditate on my God; by Guru's Grace, I cross over the terrifying world-ocean.
Renouncing self-conceit, I have become the dust of all men's feet; in this way, I die, while I am still alive. ||2||
How fruitful is the life of that being in this world, who chants the Name in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
All desires are fulfilled, for the one who is blessed with God's Kindness and Mercy. ||3||
O Merciful to the meek, Kind and Compassionate Lord God, I seek Your Sanctuary.
Take pity upon me, and bless me with Your Name. Nanak is the dust of the feet of the Holy. ||4||11||58||
Raag Soohee, Ashtapadee, First Mehl, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
I am totally without virtue; I have no virtue at all.
How can I meet my Husband Lord? ||1||
I have no beauty, no enticing eyes.
I do not have a noble family, good manners or a sweet voice. ||1||Pause||
The soul-bride adorns herself with peace and poise.
But she is a happy soul-bride, only if her Husband Lord is pleased with her. ||2||
He has no form or feature;
at the very last instant, he cannot suddenly be contemplated. ||3||
I have no understanding, intellect or cleverness.
Have Mercy upon me, God, and attach me to Your Feet. ||4||
She may be very clever, but this does not please her Husband Lord.
Attached to Maya, she is deluded by doubt. ||5||
But if she gets rid of her ego, then she merges in her Husband Lord.
Only then can the soul-bride obtain the nine treasures of her Beloved. ||6||
Separated from You for countless incarnations, I have suffered in pain.
Please take my hand, O my Beloved Sovereign Lord God. ||7||
Prays Nanak, the Lord is, and shall always be.
She alone is ravished and enjoyed, with whom the Beloved Lord is pleased. ||8||1||
