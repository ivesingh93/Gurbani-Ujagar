He preserved the mind in the fire of the womb;
at His Command, the wind blows everywhere. ||2||
These worldly attachments, loves and pleasurable tastes,
all are just black stains.
One who departs, with these black stains of sin on his face
shall find no place to sit in the Court of the Lord. ||3||
By Your Grace, we chant Your Name.
Becoming attached to it, one is saved; there is no other way.
Even if one is drowning, still, he may be saved.
O Nanak, the True Lord is the Giver of all. ||4||3||5||
Dhanaasaree, First Mehl:
If a thief praises someone, his mind is not pleased.
If a thief curses him, no damage is done.
No one will take responsibility for a thief.
How can a thief's actions be good? ||1||
Listen, O mind, you blind, false dog!
Even without your speaking, the Lord knows and understands. ||1||Pause||
A thief may be handsome, and a thief may be wise,
but he is still just a counterfeit coin, worth only a shell.
If it is kept and mixed with other coins,
it will be found to be false, when the coins are inspected. ||2||
As one acts, so does he receive.
As he plants, so does he eat.
He may praise himself gloriously,
but still, according to his understanding, so is the path he must follow. ||3||
He may tell hundreds of lies to conceal his falsehood,
and all the world may call him good.
If it pleases You, Lord, even the foolish are approved.
O Nanak, the Lord is wise, knowing, all-knowing. ||4||4||6||
Dhanaasaree, First Mehl:
The body is the paper, and the mind is the inscription written upon it.
The ignorant fool does not read what is written on his forehead.
In the Court of the Lord, three inscriptions are recorded.
Behold, the counterfeit coin is worthless there. ||1||
O Nanak, if there is silver in it,
then everyone proclaims, "It is genuine, it is genuine". ||1||Pause||
The Qazi tells lies and eats filth;
the Brahmin kills and then takes cleansing baths.
The Yogi is blind, and does not know the Way.
The three of them devise their own destruction. ||2||
He alone is a Yogi, who understands the Way.
By Guru's Grace, he knows the One Lord.
He alone is a Qazi, who turns away from the world,
and who, by Guru's Grace, remains dead while yet alive.
He alone is a Brahmin, who contemplates God.
He saves himself, and saves all his generations as well. ||3||
One who cleanses his own mind is wise.
One who cleanses himself of impurity is a Muslim.
One who reads and understands is acceptable.
Upon his forehead is the Insignia of the Court of the Lord. ||4||5||7||
Dhanaasaree, First Mehl, Third House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
No, no, this is not the time, when people know the way to Yoga and Truth.
The holy places of worship in the world are polluted, and so the world is drowning. ||1||
In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Lord's Name is the most sublime.
Some people try to deceive the world by closing their eyes and holding their nostrils closed. ||1||Pause||
They close off their nostrils with their fingers, and claim to see the three worlds.
