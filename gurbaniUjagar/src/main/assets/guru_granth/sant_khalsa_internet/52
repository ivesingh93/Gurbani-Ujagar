He frees us from bondage, O Saints, and saves us from possessiveness. ||3||
Becoming Merciful, my Lord and Master has ended my comings and goings in reincarnation.
Meeting with the Guru, Nanak has recognized the Supreme Lord God. ||4||27||97||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl, First House:
Meeting with the humble beings, O Siblings of Destiny, the Messenger of Death is conquered.
The True Lord and Master has come to dwell within my mind; my Lord and Master has become Merciful.
Meeting with the Perfect True Guru, all my worldly entanglements have ended. ||1||
O my True Guru, I am a sacrifice to You.
I am a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. By the Pleasure of Your Will, You have blessed me with the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Those who have served You with love are truly wise.
Those who have the Treasure of the Naam within emancipate others as well as themselves.
There is no other Giver as great as the Guru, who has given the gift of the soul. ||2||
Blessed and acclaimed is the coming of those who have met the Guru with loving faith.
Attuned to the True One, you shall obtain a place of honor in the Court of the Lord.
Greatness is in the Hands of the Creator; it is obtained by pre-ordained destiny. ||3||
True is the Creator, True is the Doer. True is our Lord and Master, and True is His Support.
So speak the Truest of the True. Through the True One, an intuitive and discerning mind is obtained.
Nanak lives by chanting and meditating on the One, who is pervading within and contained amongst all. ||4||28||98||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
Worship the Guru, the Transcendent Lord, with your mind and body attuned to love.
The True Guru is the Giver of the soul; He gives Support to all.
Act according to the Instructions of the True Guru; this is the true philosophy.
Without being attuned to the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, all attachment to Maya is just dust. ||1||
O my friend, reflect upon the Name of the Lord, Har, Har
In the Saadh Sangat, He dwells within the mind, and one's works are brought to perfect fruition. ||1||Pause||
The Guru is All-powerful, the Guru is Infinite. By great good fortune, the Blessed Vision of His Darshan is obtained.
The Guru is Imperceptible, Immaculate and Pure. There is no other as great as the Guru.
The Guru is the Creator, the Guru is the Doer. The Gurmukh obtains true glory.
Nothing is beyond the Guru; whatever He wishes comes to pass. ||2||
The Guru is the Sacred Shrine of Pilgrimage, the Guru is the Wish-fulfilling Elysian Tree.
The Guru is the Fulfiller of the desires of the mind. The Guru is the Giver of the Name of the Lord, by which all the world is saved.
The Guru is All-powerful, the Guru is Formless; the Guru is Lofty, Inaccessible and Infinite.
The Praise of the Guru is so sublime-what can any speaker say? ||3||
All the rewards which the mind desires are with the True Guru.
One whose destiny is so pre-ordained, obtains the Wealth of the True Name.
Entering the Sanctuary of the True Guru, you shall never die again.
Nanak: may I never forget You, Lord. This soul, body and breath are Yours. ||4||29||99||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
O Saints, O Siblings of Destiny, listen: release comes only through the True Name.
Worship the Feet of the Guru. Let the Name of the Lord be your sacred shrine of pilgrimage.
Hereafter, you shall be honored in the Court of the Lord; there, even the homeless find a home. ||1||
