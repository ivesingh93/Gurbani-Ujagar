Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
The Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the Support of the mind.
I am a sacrifice to the One who gave it to me; I humbly bow to the Perfect Guru. ||1||Pause||
My thirst is quenched, and I have been intuitively embellished. The poisons of sexual desire and anger have been burnt away.
This mind does not come and go; it abides in that place, where the Formless Lord sits. ||1||
The One Lord is manifest and radiant; the One Lord is hidden and mysterious. The One Lord is abysmal darkness.
From the beginning, throughout the middle and until the end, is God. Says Nanak, reflect on the Truth. ||2||31||54||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Without God, I cannot survive, even for an instant.
One who finds joy in the Lord finds total peace and perfection. ||1||Pause||
God is the Embodiment of bliss, the Breath of Life and Wealth; remembering Him in meditation, I am blessed with absolute bliss.
He is utterly All-powerful, with me forever and ever; what tongue can utter His Glorious Praises? ||1||
His Place is sacred, and His Glory is sacred; sacred are those who listen and speak of Him.
Says Nanak, that dwelling is sacred, in which Your Saints live. ||2||32||55||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
My tongue chants Your Name, Your Name.
In the mother's womb, You sustained me, and in this mortal world, You alone help me. ||1||Pause||
You are my Father, and You are my Mother; You are my Loving Friend and Sibling.
You are my Family, and You are my Support. You are the Giver of the Breath of Life. ||1||
You are my Treasure, and You are my Wealth. You are my Gems and Jewels.
You are the wish-fulfilling Elysian Tree. Nanak has found You through the Guru, and now he is enraptured. ||2||33||56||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Wherever he goes, his consciousness turns to his own.
Whoever is a chaylaa (a servant) goes only to his Lord and Master. ||1||Pause||
He shares his sorrows, his joys and his condition only with his own.
He obtains honor from his own, and strength from his own; he gets an advantage from his own. ||1||
Some have regal power, youth, wealth and property; some have a father and a mother.
I have obtained all things, O Nanak, from the Guru. My hopes have been fulfilled. ||2||34||57||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
False is intoxication and pride in Maya.
Get rid of your fraud and attachment, O wretched mortal, and remember that the Lord of the World is with you. ||1||Pause||
False are royal powers, youth, nobility, kings, rulers and aristocrats.
False are the fine clothes, perfumes and clever tricks; false are the foods and drinks. ||1||
O Patron of the meek and the poor, I am the slave of Your slaves; I seek the Sanctuary of Your Saints.
I humbly ask, I beg of You, please relieve my anxiety; O Lord of Life, please unite Nanak with Yourself. ||2||35||58||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
By himself, the mortal cannot accomplish anything.
He runs around chasing all sorts of projects, engrossed in other entanglements. ||1||Pause||
His companions of these few days will not be there when he is in trouble.
