Peace and tranquility, poise and pleasure, have welled up within my mind; millions of suns, O Nanak, illuminate me. ||2||5||24||
Todee, Fifth Mehl:
The Lord, Har, Har, is the Purifier of sinners;
He is the soul, the breath of life, the Giver of peace and honor, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts; He is pleasing to my mind. ||Pause||
He is beautiful and wise, clever and all-knowing. He dwells within the hearts of His slaves; His devotees sing His Glorious Praises.
His form is immaculate and pure; He is the incomparable Lord and Master. Upon the field of actions and karma, whatever one plants, one eats. ||1||
I am amazed, and wonder-struck by His wonder. There is none other than Him.
Meditating in remembrance on His Praises with my tongue, I live; slave Nanak is forever a sacrifice to Him. ||2||6||25||
Todee, Fifth Mehl:
O my mother, Maya is so misleading and deceptive.
Without meditating on the Lord of the Universe, it is like straw on fire, or the shadow of a cloud, or the running of the flood-waters. ||Pause||
Renounce your cleverness and all your mental tricks; with your palms pressed together, walk on the Path of the Holy Saints.
Remember the Lord, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts; this is the most sublime reward of this human incarnation. ||1||
The Holy Saints preach the teachings of the Vedas, but the unfortunate fools do not understand them.
Servant Nanak is absorbed in loving devotional worship; meditating in remembrance on the Lord, one's dirt is burnt away. ||2||7||26||
Todee, Fifth Mehl:
O mother, the Guru's feet are so sweet.
By great good fortune, the Transcendent Lord has blessed me with them. Millions of rewards come from the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan. ||Pause||
Singing the Glorious Praises of the imperishable, indestructible Lord, sexual desire, anger and stubborn pride vanish.
Those who are imbued with the Love of the True Lord become permanent and eternal; birth and death do not grind them down any more. ||1||
Without the Lord's meditation, all joys and pleasures are totally false and worthless; by the Kind Mercy of the Saints, I know this.
Servant Nanak has found the jewel of the Naam; without the Naam, all must depart, cheated and plundered. ||2||8||27||
Todee, Fifth Mehl:
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I contemplate the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
I am in peaceful poise and bliss, day and night; the seed of my destiny has sprouted. ||Pause||
I have met the True Guru, by great good fortune; He has no end or limitation.
Taking His humble servant by the hand, He pulls him out of the poisonous world-ocean. ||1||
Birth and death are ended for me, by the Word of the Guru's Teachings; I shall no longer pass through the door of pain and suffering.
Nanak holds tight to the Sanctuary of his Lord and Master; again and again, he bows in humility and reverence to Him. ||2||9||28||
Todee, Fifth Mehl:
O my mother, my mind is at peace.
I enjoy the ecstasy of millions of princely pleasures; remembering the Lord in meditation, all pains have been dispelled. ||1||Pause||
The sins of millions of lifetimes are erased, by meditating on the Lord; becoming pure, my mind and body have found peace.
Gazing upon the Lord's form of perfect beauty, my hopes have been fulfilled; attaining the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, my hunger has been appeased. ||1||
The four great blessings, the eight supernatural spiritual powers of the Siddhas, the wish-fulfilling Elysian cow, and the wish-fulfilling tree of life - all these come from the Lord, Har, Har.
O Nanak, holding tight to the Sanctuary of the Lord, the ocean of peace, you shall not suffer the pains of birth and death, or fall into the womb of reincarnation again. ||2||10||29||
