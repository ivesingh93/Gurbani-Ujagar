Third Mehl:
Chasing after worldly affairs, the day is wasted, and the night passes in sleep.
Speaking lies, one eats poison; the self-willed manmukh departs, crying out in pain.
The Messenger of Death holds his club over the mortal's head; in the love of duality, he loses his honor.
He never even thinks of the Name of the Lord; over and over again, he comes and goes in reincarnation.
But if, by Guru's Grace, the Lord's Name comes to dwell in his mind, then the Messenger of Death will not strike him down with his club.
Then, O Nanak, he merges intuitively into the Lord, receiving His Grace. ||2||
Pauree:
Some are linked to His Praises, when the Lord blesses them with the Guru's Teachings.

They are held in the Fear of God; He has formed the perfect form.
The Hukam, the Command of the One Lord is all-pervasive; accepting it, peace is found. ||3||

Third Mehl:
Everyone can say that they are dead while yet alive; how can they be liberated while yet alive?

O Nanak, the Gurmukh finds the Lord; he is blessed with His Glance of Grace. ||3||
Pauree:
God created the love of duality, and the three modes which pervade the universe.
He created Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, who act according to His Will.
The Pandits, the religious scholars, and the astrologers study their books, but they do not understand contemplation.
Everything is Your play, O True Creator Lord.
As it pleases You, You bless us with forgiveness, and merge us in the True Word of the Shabad. ||4||
Shalok, Third Mehl:

By Guru's Grace, one lives the Truth.
O Nanak, such a man of disciplined meditation attains liberation. ||1||
