her pain is dispelled, and she shall not become sad again. ||1||Pause||
Showing His Mercy, He joins her with His Feet,
and she attains celestial peace, joy and comfort. ||1||
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, she sings the Glorious Praises of the Immeasurable Lord.
Remembering the Lord in meditation, O Nanak, she becomes invaluable. ||2||35||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Sexual desire, anger, intoxication with Maya and jealousy - I have lost all of these in the game of chance.
Purity, contentment, compassion, faith and truthfulness - I have ushered these into the home of my self. ||1||
All the loads of birth and death have been removed.
Joining the Saints' Society, my mind has become pure; the Perfect Guru has saved me in an instant. ||1||Pause||
My mind has become the dust of all, and everyone seems a sweet friend to me.
My Lord and Master is contained in all. He gives His Gifts to all beings, and cherishes them. ||2||
He Himself is the One and only; from the One, the One and only, came the expanse of the entire creation.
Chanting and meditating, all the humble beings have become Holy; meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, so many have been saved. ||3||
The Lord of the Universe is deep, profound and infinite; He has no end or limitation.
By Your Grace, Nanak sings Your Glorious Praises; meditating, meditating, he humbly bows to God. ||4||36||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
You are Infinite, Eternal and Incomprehensible; all this is Your Creation.
What clever games can we play, when everything is contained in You? ||1||
O my True Guru, protect me, Your child, through the power of Your play.
Grant me the good sense to ever sing Your Glorious Praises, O my Inaccessible and Infinite Lord and Master. ||1||Pause||
The mortal is preserved in the womb of his mother, by the Support of the Naam, the Name of the Lord;
he makes merry, and with each and every breath he remembers the Lord, and the fire does not touch him. ||2||
Others' wealth, others' wives, and the slander of others - renounce your craving for these.
Serve the Lord's Lotus Feet within your heart, and hold to the Support of the Perfect Guru. ||3||
Houses, mansions and palaces which you see - none of these shall go with you.
As long as you live in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, O servant Nanak, remember the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||37||
Aasaa, Third House, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Power, property, youth, household, fame and the beauty of youth;
great wealth, elephants, horses and jewels, purchased with tens of thousands of dollars;
hereafter, these shall be of no avail in the Court of the Lord; the proud must depart, leaving them behind. ||1||
Why center your consciousness on any other than the Lord?
Sitting down, standing up, sleeping and waking, forever and ever, meditate on the Lord. ||1||Pause||
He may have the most wondrous and beautiful arenas, and be victorious on the field of battle.
