Bound by Maya, the mind is not stable. Each and every moment, it suffers in pain.
O Nanak, the pain of Maya is taken away by focusing one's consciousness on the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||3||
The self-willed manmukhs are foolish and crazy, O my dear; they do not enshrine the Shabad within their minds.
The delusion of Maya has made them blind, O my dear; how can they find the Way of the Lord?
How can they find the Way, without the Will of the True Guru? The manmukhs foolishly display themselves.
The Lord's servants are forever comfortable. They focus their consciousness on the Guru's Feet.
Those unto whom the Lord shows His Mercy, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord forever.
O Nanak, the jewel of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the only profit in this world. The Lord Himself imparts this understanding to the Gurmukh. ||4||5||7||
Raag Gauree, Chhant, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
My mind has become sad and depressed; how can I see God, the Great Giver?
My Friend and Companion is the Dear Lord, the Guru, the Architect of Destiny.
The One Lord, the Architect of Destiny, is the Master of the Goddess of Wealth; how can I, in my sadness, meet You?
My hands serve You, and my head is at Your Feet. My mind, dishonored, yearns for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.
With each and every breath, I think of You, day and night; I do not forget You, for an instant, even for a moment.
O Nanak, I am thirsty, like the rainbird; how can I meet God, the Great Giver? ||1||
I offer this one prayer - please listen, O my Beloved Husband Lord.
My mind and body are enticed, beholding Your wondrous play.
Beholding Your wondrous play, I am enticed; but how can the sad, forlorn bride find contentment?
My Lord is Meritorious, Merciful and Eternally Young; He is overflowing with all excellences.
The fault is not with my Husband Lord, the Giver of peace; I am separated from Him by my own mistakes.
Prays Nanak, please be merciful to me, and return home, O my Beloved Husband Lord. ||2||
I surrender my mind, I surrender my whole body; I surrender all my lands.
I surrender my head to that beloved friend, who brings me news of God.
I have offered my head to the Guru, the most exalted; He has shown me that God is with me.
In an instant, all suffering is removed. I have obtained all my mind's desires.
Day and night, the soul-bride makes merry; all her anxieties are erased.
Prays Nanak, I have met the Husband Lord of my longing. ||3||
My mind is filled with bliss, and congratulations are pouring in.
My Darling Beloved has come home to me, and all my desires have been satisfied.
I have met my Sweet Lord and Master of the Universe, and my companions sing the songs of joy.
All my friends and relatives are happy, and all traces of my enemies have been removed.
The unstruck melody vibrates in my home, and the bed has been made up for my Beloved.
Prays Nanak, I am in celestial bliss. I have obtained the Lord, the Giver of peace, as my Husband. ||4||1||
