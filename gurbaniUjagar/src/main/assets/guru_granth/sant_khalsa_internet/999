Those who embody the energies of sattva-white light, raajas-red passion, and taamas-black darkness, abide in the Fear of God, along with the many created forms.
This miserable deceiver Maya abides in the Fear of God; the Righteous Judge of Dharma is utterly afraid of Him as well. ||3||
The entire expanse of the Universe is in the Fear of God; only the Creator Lord is without this Fear.
Says Nanak, God is the companion of His devotees; His devotees look beautiful in the Court of the Lord. ||4||1||
Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:
The five year old orphan boy Dhroo, by meditating in remembrance on the Lord, became stationary and permanent.
For the sake of his son, Ajaamal called out, "O Lord, Naaraayan", who struck down and killed the Messenger of Death. ||1||
My Lord and Master has saved many, countless beings.
I am meek, with little or no understanding, and unworthy; I seek protection at the Lord's Door. ||1||Pause||
Baalmeek the outcaste was saved, and the poor hunter was saved as well.
The elephant remembered the Lord in his mind for an instant, and so was carried across. ||2||
He saved His devotee Prahlaad, and tore Harnaakhash with his nails.
Bidar, the son of a slave-girl, was purified, and all his generations were redeemed. ||3||
What sins of mine should I speak of? I am intoxicated with false emotional attachment.
Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of the Lord; please, reach out and take me into Your embrace. ||4||2||
Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:
For the sake of riches, I wandered around in so many ways; I rushed around, making all sorts of efforts.
The deeds I did in egotism and pride, have all been done in vain. ||1||
Other days are of no use to me;
please bless me with those days, O Dear God, on which I may sing the Lord's Praises. ||1||Pause||
Gazing upon children, spouse, household and possessions, one is entangled in these.
Tasting the wine of Maya, one is intoxicated, and never sings of the Lord, Har, Har. ||2||
In this way, I have examined lots of methods, but without the Saints, it is not found.
You are the Great Giver, the great and almighty God; I have come to beg a gift from You. ||3||
Abandoning all pride and self-importance, I have sought the Sanctuary of the dust of the feet of the Lord's slave.
Says Nanak, meeting with the Lord, I have become one with Him; I have found supreme bliss and peace. ||4||3||
Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:
In what place is the Name established? Where does egotism dwell?
What injury have you suffered, listening to abuse from someone else's mouth? ||1||
Listen: who are you, and where did you come from?
You don't even know how long you will stay here; you have no hint of when you shall leave. ||1||Pause||
Wind and water have patience and tolerance; the earth has compassion and forgiveness, no doubt.
The union of the five tattvas - the five elements - has brought you into being. Which of these is evil? ||2||
The Primal Lord, the Architect of Destiny, formed your form; He also burdened you with egotism.
He alone is born and dies; He alone comes and goes. ||3||
Nothing of the color and the form of the creation shall remain; the entire expanse is transitory.
Prays Nanak, when He brings His play to its close, then only the One, the One Lord remains. ||4||4||
