Seeing this world on fire, I rushed to the Sanctuary of the True Guru.
The True Guru has implanted the Truth within me; I dwell steadfastly in Truth and self-restraint.
The True Guru is the Boat of Truth; in the Word of the Shabad, we cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||6||
People continue wandering through the cycle of 8.4 million incarnations; without the True Guru, liberation is not obtained.
Reading and studying, the Pandits and the silent sages have grown weary, but attached to the love of duality, they have lost their honor.
The True Guru teaches the Word of the Shabad; without the True One, there is no other at all. ||7||
Those who are linked by the True One are linked to Truth. They always act in Truth.
They attain their dwelling in the home of their own inner being, and they abide in the Mansion of Truth.
O Nanak, the devotees are happy and peaceful forever. They are absorbed in the True Name. ||8||17||8||25||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
When you are confronted with terrible hardships, and no one offers you any support,
when your friends turn into enemies, and even your relatives have deserted you,
and when all support has given way, and all hope has been lost -
if you then come to remember the Supreme Lord God, even the hot wind shall not touch you. ||1||
Our Lord and Master is the Power of the powerless.
He does not come or go; He is Eternal and Permanent. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, He is known as True. ||1||Pause||
If you are weakened by the pains of hunger and poverty,
with no money in your pockets, and no one will give you any comfort,
and no one will satisfy your hopes and desires, and none of your works is accomplished -
if you then come to remember the Supreme Lord God, you shall obtain the eternal kingdom. ||2||
When you are plagued by great and excessive anxiety, and diseases of the body;
when you are wrapped up in the attachments of household and family, sometimes feeling joy, and then other times sorrow;
when you are wandering around in all four directions, and you cannot sit or sleep even for a moment -
if you come to remember the Supreme Lord God, then your body and mind shall be cooled and soothed. ||3||
When you are under the power of sexual desire, anger and worldly attachment, or a greedy miser in love with your wealth;
if you have committed the four great sins and other mistakes; even if you are a murderous fiend
who has never taken the time to listen to sacred books, hymns and poetry -
if you then come to remember the Supreme Lord God, and contemplate Him, even for a moment, you shall be saved. ||4||
People may recite by heart the Shaastras, the Simritees and the four Vedas;
they may be ascetics, great, self-disciplined Yogis; they may visit sacred shrines of pilgrimage
and perform the six ceremonial rituals, over and over again, performing worship services and ritual bathing.
Even so, if they have not embraced love for the Supreme Lord God, then they shall surely go to hell. ||5||
You may possess empires, vast estates, authority over others, and the enjoyment of myriad of pleasures;
you may have delightful and beautiful gardens, and issue unquestioned commands;
you may have enjoyments and entertainments of all sorts and kinds, and continue to enjoy exciting pleasures -
and yet, if you do not come to remember the Supreme Lord God, you shall be reincarnated as a snake. ||6||
You may possess vast riches, maintain virtuous conduct, have a spotless reputation and observe religious customs;
you may have the loving affections of mother, father, children, siblings and friends;
you may have armies well-equipped with weapons, and all may salute you with respect;
