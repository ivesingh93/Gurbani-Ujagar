Without the Name of the Lord, everyone wanders around the world, losing.
The self-willed manmukhs do their deeds in the pitch black darkness of egotism.
The Gurmukhs drink in the Ambrosial Nectar, O Nanak, contemplating the Word of the Shabad. ||1||
Third Mehl:
He wakes in peace, and he sleeps in peace.
The Gurmukh praises the Lord night and day.
The self-willed manmukh remains deluded by his doubts.
He is filled with anxiety, and he cannot even sleep.
The spiritually wise wake and sleep in peace.
Nanak is a sacrifice to those who are imbued with the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||
Pauree:
They alone meditate on the Lord's Name, who are imbued with the Lord.
They meditate on the One Lord; the One and Only Lord is True.
The One Lord is pervading everywhere; the One Lord created the Universe.
Those who meditate on the Lord's Name, cast out their fears.
The Lord Himself blesses them with Guru's Instruction; the Gurmukh meditates on the Lord. ||9||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Spiritual wisdom, which would bring understanding, does not enter into his mind.
Without seeing, how can he praise the Lord? The blind act in blindness.
O Nanak, when one realizes the Word of the Shabad, then the Naam comes to abide in the mind. ||1||
Third Mehl:
There is One Bani; there is One Guru; there is one Shabad to contemplate.
True is the merchandise, and true is the shop; the warehouses are overflowing with jewels.
By Guru's Grace, they are obtained, if the Great Giver gives them.
Dealing in this true merchandise, one earns the profit of the incomparable Naam.
In the midst of poison, the Ambrosial Nectar is revealed; by His Mercy, one drinks it in.
O Nanak, praise the True Lord; blessed is the Creator, the Embellisher. ||2||
Pauree:
Those who are permeated by falsehood, do not love the Truth.
If someone speaks the Truth, falsehood is burnt away.
The false are satisfied by falsehood, like the crows who eat manure.
When the Lord grants His Grace, then one meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
As Gurmukh, worship the Lord's Name in adoration; fraud and sin shall disappear. ||10||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
O Shaykh, you wander in the four directions, blown by the four winds; bring your mind back to the home of the One Lord.
Renounce your petty arguments, and realize the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Bow in humble respect before the True Guru; He is the Knower who knows everything.
Burn away your hopes and desires, and live like a guest in this world.
If you walk in harmony with the True Guru's Will, then you shall be honored in the Court of the Lord.
O Nanak, those who do not contemplate the Naam, the Name of the Lord - cursed are their clothes, and cursed is their food. ||1||
Third Mehl:
There is no end to the Lord's Glorious Praises; His worth cannot be described.
O Nanak, the Gurmukhs chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord; they are absorbed in His Glorious Virtues. ||2||
Pauree:
The Lord has adorned the coat of the body; He has embroidered it with devotional worship.
The Lord has woven His silk into it, in so many ways and fashions.
How rare is that man of understanding, who understands, and deliberates within.
He alone understands these deliberations, whom the Lord Himself inspires to understand.
Poor servant Nanak speaks: the Gurmukhs know the Lord, the Lord is True. ||11||
