You Yourself are the Creator. Everything that happens is by Your Doing.
There is no one except You.
You created the creation; You behold it and understand it.
O servant Nanak, the Lord is revealed through the Gurmukh, the Living Expression of the Guru's Word. ||4||2||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
In that pool, people have made their homes, but the water there is as hot as fire!
In the swamp of emotional attachment, their feet cannot move. I have seen them drowning there. ||1||
In your mind, you do not remember the One Lord-you fool!
You have forgotten the Lord; your virtues shall wither away. ||1||Pause||
I am not celibate, nor truthful, nor scholarly. I was born foolish and ignorant into this world.
Prays Nanak, I seek the Sanctuary of those who have not forgotten You, O Lord! ||2||3||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
This human body has been given to you.
This is your chance to meet the Lord of the Universe.
Nothing else will work.
Join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; vibrate and meditate on the Jewel of the Naam. ||1||

O Lord, I seek Your Sanctuary; please, preserve my honor! ||2||4||

One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
In that house where the Praises of the Creator are chanted and contemplated -
in that house, sing Songs of Praise; meditate and remember the Creator Lord. ||1||
Sing the Songs of Praise of my Fearless Lord.
I am a sacrifice to that Song of Praise which brings eternal peace. ||1||Pause||
Day after day, He cares for His beings; the Great Giver watches over all.
Your Gifts cannot be appraised; how can anyone compare to the Giver? ||2||
The day of my wedding is pre-ordained. Come, gather together and pour the oil over the threshold.
My friends, give me your blessings, that I may merge with my Lord and Master. ||3||
Unto each and every home, into each and every heart, this summons is sent out; the call comes each and every day.
Remember in meditation the One who summons us; O Nanak, that day is drawing near! ||4||1||
Raag Aasaa, First Mehl:
There are six schools of philosophy, six teachers, and six sets of teachings.
But the Teacher of teachers is the One, who appears in so many forms. ||1||
O Baba: that system in which the Praises of the Creator are sung -
follow that system; in it rests true greatness. ||1||Pause||
The seconds, minutes and hours, days, weeks and months,
and the various seasons originate from the one sun;
