He burned the rest-houses and the ancient temples; he cut the princes limb from limb, and cast them into the dust.
None of the Mogals went blind, and no one performed any miracle. ||4||
The battle raged between the Mogals and the Pat'haans, and the swords clashed on the battlefield.
They took aim and fired their guns, and they attacked with their elephants.
Those men whose letters were torn in the Lord's Court, were destined to die, O Siblings of Destiny. ||5||
The Hindu women, the Muslim women, the Bhattis and the Rajputs -
some had their robes torn away, from head to foot, while others came to dwell in the cremation ground.
Their husbands did not return home - how did they pass their night? ||6||
The Creator Himself acts, and causes others to act. Unto whom should we complain?
Pleasure and pain come by Your Will; unto whom should we go and cry?
The Commander issues His Command, and is pleased. O Nanak, we receive what is written in our destiny. ||7||12||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Aasaa, Kaafee, First Mehl, Eighth House, Ashtapadees:
As the shepherd is in the field for only a short time, so is one in the world.
Practicing falsehood, they build their homes. ||1||
Wake up! Wake up! O sleepers, see that the travelling merchant is leaving. ||1||Pause||
Go ahead and build your houses, if you think you will stay here forever and ever.
The body shall fall, and the soul shall depart; if only they knew this. ||2||
Why do you cry out and mourn for the dead? The Lord is, and shall always be.
You mourn for that person, but who will mourn for you? ||3||
You are engrossed in worldly entanglements, O Siblings of Destiny, and you are practicing falsehood.
The dead person does not hear anything at all; your cries are heard only by other people. ||4||
Only the Lord, who causes the mortal to sleep, O Nanak, can awaken him again.
One who understands his true home, does not sleep. ||5||
If the departing mortal can take his wealth with him,
then go ahead and gather wealth yourself. See this, reflect upon it, and understand. ||6||
Make your deals, and obtain the true merchandise, or else you shall regret it later.
Abandon your vices, and practice virtue, and you shall obtain the essence of reality. ||7||
Plant the seed of Truth in the soil of Dharmic faith, and practice such farming.
Only then will you be known as a merchant, if you take your profits with you. ||8||
If the Lord shows His Mercy, one meets the True Guru; contemplating Him, one comes to understand.
Then, one chants the Naam, hears the Naam, and deals only in the Naam. ||9||
As is the profit, so is the loss; this is the way of the world.
Whatever pleases His Will, O Nanak, is glory for me. ||10||13||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
I have searched in the four directions, but no one is mine.
If it pleases You, O Lord Master, then You are mine, and I am Yours. ||1||
There is no other door for me; where shall I go to worship?
You are my only Lord; Your True Name is in my mouth. ||1||Pause||
Some serve the Siddhas, the beings of spiritual perfection, and some serve spiritual teachers; they beg for wealth and miraculous powers.
May I never forget the Naam, the Name of the One Lord. This is the wisdom of the True Guru. ||2||
