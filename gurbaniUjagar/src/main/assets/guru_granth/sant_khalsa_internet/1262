O Nanak, the Gurmukh merges in the Naam. ||4||2||11||
Malaar, Third Mehl:
Those who are attached to the Guru's Teachings, are Jivan-mukta, liberated while yet alive.
They remain forever awake and aware night and day, in devotional worship of the Lord.
They serve the True Guru, and eradicate their self-conceit.
I fall at the feet of such humble beings. ||1||
Constantly singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, I live.
The Word of the Guru's Shabad is such totally sweet elixir. Through the Name of the Lord, I have attained the state of liberation. ||1||Pause||
Attachment to Maya leads to the darkness of ignorance.
The self-willed manmukhs are attached, foolish and ignorant.
Night and day, their lives pass away in worldly entanglements.
They die and die again and again, only to be reborn and receive their punishment. ||2||
The Gurmukh is lovingly attuned to the Name of the Lord.
He does not cling to false greed.
Whatever he does, he does with intuitive poise.
He drinks in the sublime essence of the Lord; his tongue delights in its flavor. ||3||
Among millions, hardly any understand.
The Lord Himself forgives, and bestows His glorious greatness.
Whoever meets with the Primal Lord God, shall never be separated again.
Nanak is absorbed in the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||4||3||12||
Malaar, Third Mehl:
Everyone speaks the Name of the Lord with the tongue.
But only by serving the True Guru does the mortal receive the Name.
His bonds are shattered, and he stays in the house of liberation.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he sits in the eternal, unchanging house. ||1||
O my mind, why are you angry?
In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Lord's Name is the source of profit. Contemplate and appreciate the Guru's Teachings within your heart, night and day. ||1||Pause||
Each and every instant, the rain-bird cries and calls.
Without seeing her Beloved, she does not sleep at all.
She cannot endure this separation.
When she meets the True Guru, then she intuitively meets her Beloved. ||2||
Lacking the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the mortal suffers and dies.
He is burnt in the fire of desire, and his hunger does not depart.
Without good destiny, he cannot find the Naam.
He performs all sorts of rituals until he is exhausted. ||3||
The mortal thinks about the Vedic teachings of the three gunas, the three dispositions.
He deals in corruption, filth and vice.
He dies, only to be reborn; he is ruined over and over again.
The Gurmukh enshrines the glory of the supreme state of celestial peace. ||4||
One who has faith in the Guru - everyone has faith in him.
Through the Guru's Word, the mind is cooled and soothed.
Throughout the four ages, that humble being is known to be pure.
O Nanak, that Gurmukh is so rare. ||5||4||13||9||13||22||
Raag Malaar, Fourth Mehl, First House, Chau-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Night and day, I meditate on the Lord, Har, Har, within my heart; through the Guru's Teachings, my pain is forgotten.
The chains of all my hopes and desires have been snapped; my Lord God has showered me with His Mercy. ||1||
My eyes gaze eternally on the Lord, Har, Har.
Gazing on the True Guru, my mind blossoms forth. I have met with the Lord, the Lord of the World. ||1||Pause||
