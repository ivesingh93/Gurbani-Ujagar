They are consigned to hell by the Creator Lord, and the Accountant calls them to give their account. ||2||
No brothers or sisters can go with them.
Leaving behind their property, youth and wealth, they march off.
They do not know the kind and compassionate Lord; they shall be crushed like sesame seeds in the oil-press. ||3||
You happily, cheerfully steal the possessions of others,
but the Lord God is with you, watching and listening.
Through worldly greed, you have fallen into the pit; you know nothing of the future. ||4||
You shall be born and born again, and dIE and dIE again, only to be reincarnated again.
You shall suffer terrible punishment, on your way to the land beyond.
The mortal does not know the One who created him; he is blind, and so he shall suffer. ||5||
Forgetting the Creator Lord, he is ruined.
The drama of the world is bad; it brings sadness and then happiness.
One who does not meet the Saint does not have faith or contentment; he wanders just as he pleases. ||6||
The Lord Himself stages all this drama.
Some, he lifts up, and some he throws into the waves.
As He makes them dance, so do they dance. Everyone lives their lives according to their past actions. ||7||
When the Lord and Master grants His Grace, then we meditate on Him.
In the Society of the Saints, one is not consigned to hell.
Please bless Nanak with the gift of the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord; he continually sings the songs of Your Glories. ||8||2||8||12||20||
Maaroo, Solahas, First Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The True Lord is True; there is no other at all.
He who created, shall in the end destroy.
As it pleases You, so You keep me, and so I remain; what excuse could I offer to You? ||1||
You Yourself create, and You Yourself destroy.
You yourself link each and every person to their tasks.
You contemplate Yourself, You Yourself make us worthy; You Yourself place us on the Path. ||2||
You Yourself are all-wise, You Yourself are all-knowing.
You Yourself created the Universe, and You are pleased.
You Yourself are the air, water and fire; You Yourself unite in Union. ||3||
You Yourself are the moon, the sun, the most perfect of the perfect.
You Yourself are spiritual wisdom, meditation, and the Guru, the Warrior Hero.
The Messenger of Death, and his noose of death, cannot touch one, who is lovingly focused on You, O True Lord. ||4||
You Yourself are the male, and You Yourself are the female.
You Yourself are the chess-board, and You Yourself are the chessman.
You Yourself staged the drama in the arena of the world, and You Yourself evaluate the players. ||5||
You Yourself are the bumble bee, the flower, the fruit and the tree.
You Yourself are the water, the desert, the ocean and the pool.
You Yourself are the great fish, the tortoise, the Cause of causes; Your form cannot be known. ||6||
You Yourself are the day, and You Yourself are the night.
You Yourself are pleased by the Word of the Guru's Bani.
From the very beginning, and throughout the ages, the unstruck sound current resounds, night and day; in each and every heart, the Word of the Shabad, echoes Your Will. ||7||
You Yourself are the jewel, incomparably beautiful and priceless.
You Yourself are the Assessor, the Perfect Weigher.
