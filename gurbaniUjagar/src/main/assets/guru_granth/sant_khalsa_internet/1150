All the desires of my mind have been perfectly fulfilled.
Twenty-four hours a day, I sing of the Lord God.
The True Guru has imparted this perfect wisdom. ||1||
Very fortunate are those who love the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Associating with them, we cross over the world-ocean. ||1||Pause||
They are spiritual teachers, who meditate in remembrance on the One Lord.
Wealthy are those who have a discriminating intellect.
Noble are those who remember their Lord and Master in meditation.
Honorable are those who understand their own selves. ||2||
By Guru's Grace, I have obtained the supreme status.
Day and night I meditate on the Glories of God.
My bonds are broken, and my hopes are fulfilled.
The Feet of the Lord now abide in my heart. ||3||
Says Nanak, one whose karma is perfect-
that humble being enters the Sanctuary of God.
He himself is pure, and he sanctifies all.
His tongue chants the Name of the Lord, the Source of Nectar. ||4||35||48||
Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
Repeating the Naam, the Name of the Lord, no obstacles block the way.
Listening to the Naam, the Messenger of Death runs far away.
Repeating the Naam, all pains vanish.
Chanting the Naam, the Lord's Lotus Feet dwell within. ||1||
Meditating, vibrating the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is unobstructed devotional worship.
Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord with loving affection and energy. ||1||Pause||
Meditating in remembrance on the Lord, the Eye of Death cannot see you.
Meditating in remembrance on the Lord, demons and ghosts shall not touch you.
Meditating in remembrance on the Lord, attachment and pride shall not bind you.
Meditating in remembrance on the Lord, you shall not be consigned to the womb of reincarnation. ||2||
Any time is a good time to meditate in remembrance on the Lord.
Among the masses, only a few meditate in remembrance on the Lord.
Social class or no social class, anyone may meditate on the Lord.
Whoever meditates on Him is emancipated. ||3||
Chant the Name of the Lord in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
Perfect is the Love of the Lord's Name.
O God, shower Your Mercy on Nanak,
that he may think of you with each and every breath. ||4||36||49||
Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
He Himself is the Shaastras, and He Himself is the Vedas.
He knows the secrets of each and every heart.
He is the Embodiment of Light; all beings belong to Him.
The Creator, the Cause of causes, the Perfect All-powerful Lord. ||1||
Grab hold of the Support of God, O my mind.
As Gurmukh, worship and adore His Lotus Feet; enemies and pains shall not even approach you. ||1||Pause||
He Himself is the Essence of the forests and fields, and all the three worlds.
The universe is strung on His Thread.
He is the Uniter of Shiva and Shakti - mind and matter.
He Himself is in the detachment of Nirvaanaa, and He Himself is the Enjoyer. ||2||
Wherever I look, there He is.
Without Him, there is no one at all.
In the Love of the Naam, the world-ocean is crossed.
Nanak sings His Glorious Praises in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||3||
Liberation, the ways and means of enjoyment and union are under His Control.
His humble servant lacks nothing.
That person, with whom the Lord, in His Mercy, is pleased -
O slave Nanak, that humble servant is blessed. ||4||37||50||
Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
The minds of the Lord's devotee are filled with bliss.
They become stable and permanent, and all their anxiety is gone.
