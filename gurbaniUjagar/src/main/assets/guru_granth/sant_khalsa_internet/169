The Lord, Har, Har, dwells close by, all over the world. He is Infinite, All-powerful and Immeasurable.
The Perfect Guru has revealed the Lord, Har, Har, to me. I have sold my head to the Guru. ||3||
O Dear Lord, inside and outside, I am in the protection of Your Sanctuary; You are the Greatest of the Great, All-powerful Lord.
Servant Nanak sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, night and day, meeting the Guru, the True Guru, the Divine Intermediary. ||4||1||15||53||
Gauree Poorbee, Fourth Mehl:
Life of the World, Infinite Lord and Master, Master of the Universe, All-powerful Architect of Destiny.
Whichever way You turn me, O my Lord and Master, that is the way I shall go. ||1||
O Lord, my mind is attuned to the Lord's Love.
Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, I have obtained the sublime essence of the Lord. I am absorbed in the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
The Lord, Har, Har, and the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is the panacea, the medicine for the world. The Lord, and the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, bring peace and tranquility.
Those who partake of the Lord's sublime essence, through the Guru's Teachings - their sins and sufferings are all eliminated. ||2||
Those who have such pre-ordained destiny inscribed on their foreheads, bathe in the pool of contentment of the Guru.
The filth of evil-mindedness is totally washed away, from those who are imbued with the Love of the Lord's Name. ||3||
O Lord, You Yourself are Your Own Master, O God. There is no other Giver as Great as You.
Servant Nanak lives by the Naam, the Name of the Lord; by the Lord's Mercy, he chants the Lord's Name. ||4||2||16||54||
Gauree Poorbee, Fourth Mehl:
Show Mercy to me, O Life of the World, O Great Giver, so that my mind may merge with the Lord.
The True Guru has bestowed His most pure and sacred Teachings. Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har, my mind is transfixed and enraptured. ||1||
O Lord, my mind and body have been pierced through by the True Lord.
The whole world is caught and held in the mouth of Death. Through the Teachings of the Guru, the True Guru, O Lord, I am saved. ||1||Pause||
Those who are not in love with the Lord are foolish and false - they are faithless cynics.
They suffer the most extreme agonies of birth and death; they dIE over and over again, and they rot away in manure. ||2||
You are the Merciful Cherisher of those who seek Your Sanctuary. I beg of You: please grant me Your gift, Lord.
Make me the slave of the Lord's slaves, so that my mind might dance in Your Love. ||3||
He Himself is the Great Banker; God is our Lord and Master. I am His petty merchant.
My mind, body and soul are all Your capital assets. You, O God, are the True Banker of servant Nanak. ||4||3||17||55||
Gauree Poorbee, Fourth Mehl:
You are Merciful, the Destroyer of all pain. Please give me Your Ear and listen to my prayer.
Please unite me with the True Guru, my breath of life; through Him, O my Lord and Master, You are known. ||1||
O Lord, I acknowledge the True Guru as the Supreme Lord God.
I am foolish and ignorant, and my intellect is impure. Through the Teachings of the Guru, the True Guru, O Lord, I come to know You. ||1||Pause||
All the pleasures and enjoyments which I have seen - I have found them all to be bland and insipid.
