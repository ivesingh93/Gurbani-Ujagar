This wretched world is a fortress of paper, of color and form and clever tricks.
A tiny drop of water or a little puff of wind destroys its glory; in an instant, its life is ended. ||4||
It is like a tree-house near the bank of a river, with a serpent's den in that house.
When the river overflows, what happens to the tree house? The snake bites, like duality in the mind. ||5||
Through the magic spell of the Guru's spiritual wisdom, and meditation on the Word of the Guru's Teachings, vice and corruption are burnt away.
The mind and body are cooled and soothed and Truth is obtained, through the wondrous and unique devotional worship of the Lord. ||6||
All that exists begs of You; You are merciful to all beings.
I seek Your Sanctuary; please save my honor, O Lord of the World, and bless me with Truth. ||7||
Bound in worldly affairs and entanglements, the blind one does not understand; he acts like a murderous butcher.
But if he meets with the True Guru, then he comprehends and understands, and his mind is imbued with true spiritual wisdom. ||8||
Without the Truth, this worthless body is false; I have consulted my Guru on this.
O Nanak, that God has revealed God to me; without the Truth, all the world is just a dream. ||9||2||
Malaar, First Mehl:
The rainbird and the fish find peace in water; the deer is pleased by the sound of the bell. ||1||
The rainbird chirps in the night, O my mother. ||1||Pause||
O my Beloved, my love for You shall never end, if it is Your Will. ||2||
Sleep is gone, and egotism is exhausted from my body; my heart is permeated with the Teachings of Truth. ||3||
Flying among the trees and plants, I remain hungry; lovingly drinking in the Naam, the Name of the Lord, I am satisfied. ||4||
I stare at You, and my tongue cries out to You; I am so thirsty for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. ||5||
Without my Beloved, the more I decorate myself, the more my body burns; these clothes do not look good on my body. ||6||
Without my Beloved, I cannot survive even for an instant; without meeting Him, I cannot sleep. ||7||
Her Husband Lord is nearby, but the wretched bride does not know it. The True Guru reveals Him to her. ||8||
When she meets Him with intuitive ease, she finds peace; the Word of the Shabad quenches the fire of desire. ||9||
Says Nanak, through You, O Lord, my mind is pleased and appeased; I cannot express Your worth. ||10||3||
Malaar, First Mehl, Ashtapadees, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The earth bends under the weight of the water,
the lofty mountains and the caverns of the underworld.
Contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the oceans become calm.
The path of liberation is found by subduing the ego. ||1||
I am blind; I seek the Light of the Name.
I take the Support of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. I walk on the path of mystery of the Guru's Fear. ||1||Pause||
