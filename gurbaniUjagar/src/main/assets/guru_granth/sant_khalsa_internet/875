O Pandit, I saw your Raam Chand coming too
; he lost his wife, fighting a war against Raawan. ||3||
The Hindu is sightless; the Muslim has only one eye.
The spiritual teacher is wiser than both of them.
The Hindu worships at the temple, the Muslim at the mosque.
Naam Dayv serves that Lord, who is not limited to either the temple or the mosque. ||4||3||7||
Raag Gond, The Word Of Ravi Daas Jee, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Meditate on the Lord Mukanday, the Liberator, O people of the world.
Without Mukanday, the body shall be reduced to ashes.
Mukanday is the Giver of liberation.
Mukanday is my father and mother. ||1||
Meditate on Mukanday in life, and meditate on Mukanday in death.
His servant is blissful forever. ||1||Pause||
The Lord, Mukanday, is my breath of life.
Meditating on Mukanday, one's forehead will bear the Lord's insignia of approval.
The renunciate serves Mukanday.
Mukanday is the wealth of the poor and forlorn. ||2||
When the One Liberator does me a favor,
then what can the world do to me?
Erasing my social status, I have entered His Court.
You, Mukanday, are potent throughout the four ages. ||3||
Spiritual wisdom has welled up, and I have been enlightened.
In His Mercy, the Lord has made this worm His slave.
Says Ravi Daas, now my thirst is quenched;
I meditate on Mukanday the Liberator, and I serve Him. ||4||1||
Gond:
Someone may bathe at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage,
and worship the twelve Shiva-lingam stones,
and dig wells and pools,
but if he indulges in slander, then all of this is useless. ||1||
How can the slanderer of the Holy Saints be saved?
Know for certain, that he shall go to hell. ||1||Pause||
Someone may bathe at Kuruk-shaytra during a solar eclipse,
and give his decorated wife in offering,
and listen to all the Simritees,
but if he indulges in slander, these are of no account. ||2||
Someone may give countless feasts,
and donate land, and build splendid buildings;
he may neglect his own affairs to work for others,
but if he indulges in slander, he shall wander in countless incarnations. ||3||
Why do you indulge in slander, O people of the world?
The emptiness of the slanderer is soon exposed.
I have thought, and determined the fate of the slanderer.
Says Ravi Daas, he is a sinner; he shall go to hell. ||4||2||11||7||2||49|| Total||
