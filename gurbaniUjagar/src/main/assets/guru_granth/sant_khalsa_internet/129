Day and night, they are in love with the True Word of the Shabad. They obtain their home in the Ocean of the Lord. ||5||
The self-willed manmukhs shall always be filthy cranes, smeared with the filth of ego.
They may bathe, but their filth is not removed.
One who dies while yet alive, and contemplates the Word of the Guru's Shabad, is rid of this filth of ego. ||6||
The Priceless Jewel is found, in the home of one's own being,
when one listens to the Shabad, the Word of the Perfect True Guru.
By Guru's Grace, the darkness of spiritual ignorance is dispelled; I have come to recognize the Divine Light within my own heart. ||7||
The Lord Himself creates, and He Himself beholds.
Serving the True Guru, one becomes acceptable.
O Nanak, the Naam dwells deep within the heart; by Guru's Grace, it is obtained. ||8||31||32||
Maajh, Third Mehl:
The whole world is engrossed in emotional attachment to Maya.
Those who are controlled by the three qualities are attached to Maya.
By Guru's Grace, a few come to understand; they center their consciousness in the fourth state. ||1||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who burn away their emotional attachment to Maya, through the Shabad.
Those who burn away this attachment to Maya, and focus their consciousness on the Lord are honored in the True Court, and the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. ||1||Pause||
The source, the root, of the gods and goddesses is Maya.
For them, the Simritees and the Shaastras were composed.
Sexual desire and anger are diffused throughout the universe. Coming and going, people suffer in pain. ||2||
The jewel of spiritual wisdom was placed within the universe.
By Guru's Grace, it is enshrined within the mind.
Celibacy, chastity, self-discipline and the practice of truthfulness are obtained from the Perfect Guru, by meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||3||
In this world of her parents' home, the soul-bride has been deluded by doubt.
Attached to duality, she later comes to regret it.
She forfeits both this world and the next, and even in her dreams, she does not find peace. ||4||
The soul-bride who remembers her Husband Lord in this world,
by Guru's Grace, sees Him close at hand.
She remains intuitively attuned to the Love of her Beloved; she makes the Word of His Shabad her decoration. ||5||
Blessed and fruitful is the coming of those who find the True Guru;
through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they burn their love of duality.
The One Lord is permeating and pervading deep within the heart. Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, they sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||6||
Those who do not serve the True Guru-why did they even come into this world?
Cursed are their lives; they have uselessly wasted this human life.
The self-willed manmukhs do not remember the Naam. Without the Naam, they suffer in terrible pain. ||7||
The One who created the Universe, He alone knows it.
He unites with Himself those who realize the Shabad.
O Nanak, they alone receive the Naam, upon whose foreheads such pre-ordained destiny is recorded. ||8||1||32||33||
Maajh, Fourth Mehl:
The Primal Being is Himself remote and beyond.
He Himself establishes, and having established, He disestablishes.
The One Lord is pervading in all; those who become Gurmukh are honored. ||1||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Formless Lord.
