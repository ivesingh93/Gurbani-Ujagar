As it pleases You, Lord, please save and protect me. Without You, O my Husband Lord, who else is there for me? ||3||
Reading their books over and over again, people continue making mistakes; they are so proud of their religious robes.
But what is the use of bathing at sacred shrines of pilgrimage, when the filth of stubborn pride is within the mind?
Other than the Guru, who can explain that within the mind is the Lord, the King, the Emperor? ||4||
The Treasure of the Lord's Love is obtained by the Gurmukh, who contemplates the essence of reality.
The bride eradicates her selfishness, and adorns herself with the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Within her own home, she finds her Husband, through infinite love for the Guru. ||5||

Siree Raag, First Mehl:
The enticing desire for Maya leads people to become emotionally attached to their children, relatives, households and spouses.
The world is deceived and plundered by riches, youth, greed and egotism.
The drug of emotional attachment has destroyed me, as it has destroyed the whole world. ||1||
O my Beloved, I have no one except You.
Without You, nothing else pleases me. Loving You, I am at peace. ||1||Pause||
I sing the Praises of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, with love; I am content with the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Whatever is seen shall pass away. So do not be attached to this false show.
Like a traveler in his travels, you have come. Behold the caravan leaving each day. ||2||

If someone receives the Glory of the Naam, he is attuned to truth and blessed with honor.
Those who are pleasing to You are good; no one is counterfeit or genuine. ||3||
In the Guru's Sanctuary we are saved. The assets of the self-willed manmukhs are false.

The Assayer Himself assays them, and He places the genuine ones in His Treasury. ||4||
Your Value cannot be appraised; I have seen and tested everything.
By speaking, His Depth cannot be found. Abiding in truth, honor is obtained.
Through the Guru's Teachings, I praise You; otherwise, I cannot describe Your Value. ||5||
That body which does not appreciate the Naam-that body is infested with egotism and conflict.
Without the Guru, spiritual wisdom is not obtained; other tastes are poison.
Without virtue, nothing is of any use. The taste of Maya is bland and insipid. ||6||
Through desire, people are cast into the womb and reborn. Through desire, they taste the sweet and sour flavors.
Bound by desire, they are led on, beaten and struck on their faces and mouths.
Bound and gagged and assaulted by evil, they are released only through the Name, through the Guru's Teachings. ||7||
