you shall not find the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.
When you embrace love for the Lord,
says Kabeer, then, you shall become pure in your very fiber. ||8||1||
Raag Gauree Chaytee, The Word Of Naam Dayv Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
God makes even stones float.
So why shouldn't Your humble slave also float across, chanting Your Name, O Lord? ||1||Pause||
You saved the prostitute, and the ugly hunch-back; You helped the hunter and Ajaamal swim across as well.
The hunter who shot Krishna in the foot - even he was liberated.
I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to those who chant the Lord's Name. ||1||
You saved Bidur, the son of the slave-girl, and Sudama; You restored Ugrasain to his throne.
Without meditation, without penance, without a good family, without good deeds, Naam Dayv's Lord and Master saved them all. ||2||1||
Raag Gauree, Padas Of Ravi Daas Jee, Gauree Gwaarayree:
One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. By Guru's Grace:
The company I keep is wretched and low, and I am anxious day and night;
my actions are crooked, and I am of lowly birth. ||1||
O Lord, Master of the earth, Life of the soul,
please do not forget me! I am Your humble servant. ||1||Pause||
Take away my pains, and bless Your humble servant with Your Sublime Love.
I shall not leave Your Feet, even though my body may perish. ||2||
Says Ravi Daas, I seek the protection of Your Sanctuary;
please, meet Your humble servant - do not delay! ||3||1||
Baygumpura, 'the city without sorrow', is the name of the town.
There is no suffering or anxiety there.
There are no troubles or taxes on commodities there.
There is no fear, blemish or downfall there. ||1||
Now, I have found this most excellent city.
There is lasting peace and safety there, O Siblings of Destiny. ||1||Pause||
God's Kingdom is steady, stable and eternal.
There is no second or third status; all are equal there.
That city is populous and eternally famous.
Those who live there are wealthy and contented. ||2||
They stroll about freely, just as they please.
They know the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, and no one blocks their way.
Says Ravi Daas, the emancipated shoe-maker:
whoever is a citizen there, is a friend of mine. ||3||2||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Gauree Bairaagan, Ravi Daas Jee:
The path to God is very treacherous and mountainous, and all I have is this worthless ox.
I offer this one prayer to the Lord, to preserve my capital. ||1||
Is there any merchant of the Lord to join me? My cargo is loaded, and now I am leaving. ||1||Pause||
I am the merchant of the Lord; I deal in spiritual wisdom.
