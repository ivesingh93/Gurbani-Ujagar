They do their evil deeds, and pretend otherwise;
but in the Court of the Lord, they shall be bound and gagged like thieves. ||1||
Those who remember the Lord belong to the Lord.
The One Lord is contained in the water, the land and the sky. ||1||Pause||
Their inner beings are filled with poison, and yet with their mouths, they preach words of Ambrosial Nectar.
Bound and gagged in the City of Death, they are punished and beaten. ||2||
Hiding behind many screens, they commit acts of corruption,
but in an instant, they are revealed to all the world. ||3||
Those whose inner beings are true, who are attuned to the ambrosial essence of the Naam, the Name of the Lord -
O Nanak, the Lord, the Architect of Destiny, is merciful to them. ||4||71||140||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
The Lord's Love shall never leave or depart.
They alone understand, unto whom the Perfect Guru gives it. ||1||
One whose mind is attuned to the Lord's Love is true.
The Love of the Beloved, the Architect of Destiny, is perfect. ||1||Pause||
Sitting in the Society of the Saints, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
The color of His Love shall never fade away. ||2||
Without meditating in remembrance on the Lord, peace is not found.
All the other loves and tastes of Maya are bland and insipid. ||3||
Those who are imbued with love by the Guru become happy.
Says Nanak, the Guru has become merciful to them. ||4||72||141||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:

and one comes to abide in peace, celestial joy and bliss. ||1||

In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, there is no fear or doubt.
The Glorious Praises of the Lord are sung there, day and night. ||2||
Granting His Grace, God has released me from bondage.
He has given me the Support of His Lotus Feet. ||3||
Says Nanak, faith comes into the mind of His servant,
who continually drinks in the Immaculate Praises of the Lord. ||4||73||142||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Those who keep their minds attached to the Lord's Feet -
pain, suffering and doubt run away from them. ||1||
Those who deal in the Lord's wealth are perfect.
Those who are honored by the Lord are the true spiritual heroes. ||1||Pause||
Those humble beings, unto whom the Lord of the Universe shows mercy,
fall at the Guru's Feet. ||2||
They are blessed with peace, celestial bliss, tranquility and ecstasy;
chanting and meditating, they live in supreme bliss. ||3||
In the Saadh Sangat, I have earned the wealth of the Naam.
Says Nanak, God has relieved my pain. ||4||74||143||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Meditating in remembrance on the Lord, all suffering is eradicated.
The Lord's Lotus Feet are enshrined within my mind. ||1||
Chant the Lord's Name, hundreds of thousands of times, O my dear,
and drink deeply of the Ambrosial Essence of God. ||1||Pause||
Peace, celestial bliss, pleasures and the greatest ecstasy are obtained;
chanting and meditating, you shall live in supreme bliss. ||2||
Sexual desire, anger, greed and ego are eradicated;
in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, all sinful mistakes are washed away. ||3||
Grant Your Grace, O God, O Merciful to the meek.
Please bless Nanak with the dust of the feet of the Holy. ||4||75||144||
