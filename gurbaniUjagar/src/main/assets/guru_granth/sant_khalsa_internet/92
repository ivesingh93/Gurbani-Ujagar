You have misled the world so deeply in doubt.
How can people understand You, when they are entranced by Maya? ||1||Pause||
Says Kabeer, give up the pleasures of corruption, or else you will surely die of them.
Meditate on the Lord, O mortal being, through the Word of His Bani; you shall be blessed with eternal life. In this way, shall you cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||2||
As it pleases Him, people embrace love for the Lord,
and doubt and delusion are dispelled from within.
Intuitive peace and poise well up within, and the intellect is awakened to spiritual wisdom.
By Guru's Grace, the inner being is touched by the Lord's Love. ||3||
In this association, there is no death.
Recognizing the Hukam of His Command, you shall meet with your Lord and Master. ||1||Second. Pause||
Siree Raag, Trilochan:
The mind is totally attached to Maya; the mortal has forgotten his fear of old age and death.
Gazing upon his family, he blossoms forth like the lotus flower; the deceitful person watches and covets the homes of others. ||1||
When the powerful Messenger of Death comes,
no one can stand against his awesome power.
Rare, very rare, is that friend who comes and says,
O my Beloved, take me into Your Embrace!
Meet me O my Lord and please save me! ||1||Pause||
Indulging in all sorts of princely pleasures, O mortal, you have forgotten God; you have fallen into the world-ocean, and you think that you have become immortal.
Cheated and plundered by Maya, you do not think of God, and you waste your life in laziness. ||2||
The path you must walk is treacherous and terrifying, O mortal; neither the sun nor the moon shine there.
Your emotional attachment to Maya will be forgotten, when you have to leave this world. ||3||
Today, it became clear to my mind that the Righteous Judge of Dharma is watching us.
His messengers, with their awesome power, crush people between their hands; I cannot stand against them. ||4||
If someone is going to teach me something, let it be that the Lord is pervading the forests and fields.
O Dear Lord, You Yourself know everything; so prays Trilochan, Lord. ||5||2||
Siree Raag, Devotee Kabeer Jee:
Listen, O religious scholar: the One Lord alone is Wondrous; no one can describe Him.
He fascinates the angels, the celestial singers and the heavenly musicians; he has strung the three worlds upon His Thread. ||1||
The Unstruck Melody of the Sovereign Lord's Harp vibrates;
by His Glance of Grace, we are lovingly attuned to the Sound-current of the Naad. ||1||Pause||
The Tenth Gate of my crown chakra is the distilling fire, and the channels of the Ida and Pingala are the funnels, to pour in and empty out the golden vat.
Into that vat, there trickles a gentle stream of the most sublime and pure essence of all distilled essences. ||2||
Something wonderful has happened-the breath has become the cup.
In all the three worlds, such a Yogi is unique. What king can compare to him? ||3||
This spiritual wisdom of God, the Supreme Soul, has illuminated my being. Says Kabeer, I am attuned to His Love.
All the rest of the world is deluded by doubt, while my mind is intoxicated with the Sublime Essence of the Lord. ||4||3||
