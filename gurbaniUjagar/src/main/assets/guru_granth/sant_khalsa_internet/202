By the Grace of the Saints, I have obtained the supreme status. ||2||
The Lord is the Help and Support of His humble servant.
I have found peace, falling at the feet of His slaves.
When selfishness is gone, then one becomes the Lord Himself;
seek the Sanctuary of the treasure of mercy. ||3||
When someone finds the One he has desired,
then where should he go to look for Him?
I have become steady and stable, and I dwell in the seat of peace.
By Guru's Grace, Nanak has entered the home of peace. ||4||110||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
The merits of taking millions of ceremonial cleansing baths,
the giving of hundreds of thousands, billions and trillions in charity -
these are obtained by those whose minds are filled with the Name of the Lord. ||1||
Those who sing the Glories of the Lord of the World are totally pure.
Their sins are erased, in the Sanctuary of the Kind and Holy Saints. ||Pause||
The merits of performing all sorts of austere acts of penance and self-discipline,
earning huge profits and seeing one's desires fulfilled -
these are obtained by chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, with the tongue. ||2||
The merits of reciting the Simritees, the Shaastras and the Vedas,
knowledge of the science of Yoga, spiritual wisdom and the pleasure of miraculous spiritual powers -
these come by surrendering the mind and meditating on the Name of God. ||3||
The wisdom of the Inaccessible and Infinite Lord is incomprehensible.
Meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and contemplating the Naam within our hearts,
O Nanak, God has showered His Mercy upon us. ||4||111||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Meditating, meditating, meditating in remembrance, I have found peace.
I have enshrined the Lotus Feet of the Guru within my heart. ||1||
The Guru, the Lord of the Universe, the Supreme Lord God, is perfect.
Worshipping Him, my mind has found a lasting peace. ||Pause||
Night and day, I meditate on the Guru, and the Name of the Guru.
Thus all my works are brought to perfection. ||2||
Beholding the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, my mind has become cool and tranquil,
and the sinful mistakes of countless incarnations have been washed away. ||3||
Says Nanak, where is fear now, O Siblings of Destiny?
The Guru Himself has preserved the honor of His servant. ||4||112||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
The Lord Himself is the Help and Support of His servants.
He always cherishes them, like their father and mother. ||1||
In God's Sanctuary, everyone is saved.
That Perfect True Lord is the Doer, the Cause of causes. ||Pause||
My mind now dwells in the Creator Lord.
My fears have been dispelled, and my soul has found the most sublime peace. ||2||
The Lord has granted His Grace, and saved His humble servant.
The sinful mistakes of so many incarnations have been washed away. ||3||
The Greatness of God cannot be described.
Servant Nanak is forever in His Sanctuary. ||4||113||
Raag Gauree Chaytee, Fifth Mehl, Du-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The power of the Lord is universal and perfect, O Siblings of Destiny.
So no pain can ever afflict me. ||1||Pause||
Whatever the Lord's slave wishes, O mother,
the Creator Himself causes that to be done. ||1||
God causes the slanderers to lose their honor.
Nanak sings the Glorious Praises of the Fearless Lord. ||2||114||
