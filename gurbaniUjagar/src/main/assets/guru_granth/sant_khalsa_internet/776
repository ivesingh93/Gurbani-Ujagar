One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O humble Saints, I have met my Beloved Guru; the fire of my desire is quenched, and my yearning is gone.
I dedicate my mind and body to the True Guru; I pray that may He unite me with God, the treasure of virtue.
Blessed, blessed is the Guru, the Supreme Being, who tells me of the most blessed Lord.
By great good fortune, servant Nanak has found the Lord; he blossoms forth in the Naam. ||1||
I have met my Beloved Friend, the Guru, who has shown me the Path to the Lord.
Come home - I have been separated from You for so long! Please, let me merge with You, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, O my Lord God.
Without You, I am so sad; like a fish out of water, I shall die.
The very fortunate ones meditate on the Lord; servant Nanak merges into the Naam. ||2||
The mind runs around in the ten directions; the self-willed manmukh wanders around, deluded by doubt.
In his mind, he continually conjures up hopes; his mind is gripped by hunger and thirst.
There is an infinite treasure buried within the mind, but still, he goes out, searching for poison.
O servant Nanak, praise the Naam, the Name of the Lord; without the Name, he rots away, and wastes away to death. ||3||
Finding the beautiful and fascinating Guru, I have conquered my mind, through the Bani, the Word of my Beloved Lord.
My heart has forgotten its common sense and wisdom; my mind has forgotten its hopes and cares.
Deep within my self, I feel the pains of divine love. Beholding the Guru, my mind is comforted and consoled.
Awaken my good destiny, O God - please, come and meet me! Each and every instant, servant Nanak is a sacrifice to You. ||4||1||5||
Soohee, Chhant, Fourth Mehl:
Eradicate the poison of egotism, O human being; it is holding you back from meeting your Lord God.
This golden-colored body has been disfigured and ruined by egotism.
Attachment to Maya is total darkness; this foolish, self-willed manmukh is attached to it.
O servant Nanak, the Gurmukh is saved; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he is released from egotism. ||1||
Overcome and subdue this mind; your mind wanders around continually, like a falcon.
The mortal's life-night passes painfully, in constant hope and desire.
I have found the Guru, O humble Saints; my mind's hopes are fulfilled, chanting the Lord's Name.
Please bless servant Nanak, O God, with such understanding, that abandoning false hopes, he may always sleep in peace. ||2||
The bride hopes in her mind, that her Sovereign Lord God will come to her bed.
My Lord and Master is infinitely compassionate; O Sovereign Lord, be merciful, and merge me into Yourself.
