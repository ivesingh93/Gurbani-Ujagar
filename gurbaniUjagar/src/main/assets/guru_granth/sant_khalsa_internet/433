Chhachha: Ignorance exists within everyone; doubt is Your doing, O Lord.
Having created doubt, You Yourself cause them to wander in delusion; those whom You bless with Your Mercy meet with the Guru. ||10||
Jajja: That humble being who begs for wisdom has wandered begging through 8.4 million incarnations.
The One Lord takes away, and the One Lord gives; I have not heard of any other. ||11||
Jhajha: O mortal being, why are you dying of anxiety? Whatever the Lord is to give, He shall keep on giving.
He gives, and gives, and watches over us; according to the Orders which He issues, His beings receive nourishment. ||12||
Nyanya: When the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace, then I do not behold any other.
The One Lord is totally pervading everywhere; the One Lord abides within the mind. ||13||
Tatta: Why do you practice hypocrisy, O mortal? In a moment, in an instant, you shall have to get up and depart.
Don't lose your life in the gamble - hurry to the Lord's Sanctuary. ||14||
T'hat'ha: Peace pervades within those who link their consciousness to the Lord's Lotus Feet.
Those humble beings, whose consciousness is so linked, are saved; by Your Grace, they obtain peace. ||15||
Dadda: Why do you make such ostentatious shows, O mortal? Whatever exists, shall all pass away.
So serve Him, who is contained and pervading among everyone, and you shall obtain peace. ||16||
Dhadha: He Himself establishes and disestablishes; as it pleases His Will, so does He act.
Having created the creation, He watches over it; He issues His Commands, and emancipates those, upon whom He casts His Glance of Grace. ||17||
Nanna: One whose heart is filled with the Lord, sings His Glorious Praises.
One whom the Creator Lord unites with Himself, is not consigned to reincarnation. ||18||
Tatta: The terrible world-ocean is so very deep; its limits cannot be found.
I do not have a boat, or even a raft; I am drowning - save me, O Savior King! ||19||
T'hat'ha: In all places and interspaces, He is; everything which exists, is by His doing.
What is doubt? What is called Maya? Whatever pleases Him is good. ||20||
Dadda: Do not blame anyone else; blame instead your own actions.
Whatever I did, for that I have suffered; I do not blame anyone else. ||21||
Dhadha: His power established and upholds the earth; the Lord has imparted His color to everything.
His gifts are received by everyone; all act according to His Command. ||22||
Nanna: The Husband Lord enjoys eternal pleasures, but He is not seen or understood.
I am called the happy soul-bride, O sister, but my Husband Lord has never met me. ||23||
Pappa: The Supreme King, the Transcendent Lord, created the world, and watches over it.
He sees and understands, and knows everything; inwardly and outwardly, he is fully pervading. ||24||

By Guru's Grace, they alone are saved, who hurry to enter the Lord's Sanctuary. ||25||
Babba: He set out to play the game, on the chess-board of the four ages.
