Maajh, Third Mehl:
The self-willed manmukhs read and recite; they are called Pandits-spiritual scholars.
But they are in love with duality, and they suffer in terrible pain.
Intoxicated with vice, they understand nothing at all. They are reincarnated, over and over again. ||1||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who subdue their ego, and unite with the Lord.
They serve the Guru, and the Lord dwells within their minds; they intuitively drink in the sublime essence of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
The Pandits read the Vedas, but they do not obtain the Lord's essence.
Intoxicated with Maya, they argue and debate.
The foolish intellectuals are forever in spiritual darkness. The Gurmukhs understand, and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||2||
The Indescribable is described only through the beauteous Word of the Shabad.
Through the Guru's Teachings, the Truth becomes pleasing to the mind.
Those who speak of the truest of the true, day and night-their minds are imbued with the Truth. ||3||
Those who are attuned to Truth, love the Truth.
The Lord Himself bestows this gift; He shall not take it back.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the True Lord is known forever; meeting the True One, peace is found. ||4||
The filth of fraud and falsehood does not stick to those,
who, by Guru's Grace, remain awake and aware, night and day.
The Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides deep within their hearts; their light merges into the Light. ||5||
They read about the three qualities, but they do not know the essential reality of the Lord.
They forget the Primal Lord, the Source of all, and they do not recognize the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
They are engrossed in emotional attachment; they do not understand anything at all. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the Lord is found. ||6||
The Vedas proclaim that Maya is of three qualities.
The self-willed manmukhs, in love with duality, do not understand.
They read of the three qualities, but they do not know the One Lord. Without understanding, they obtain only pain and suffering. ||7||
When it pleases the Lord, He unites us with Himself.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, skepticism and suffering are dispelled.
O Nanak, True is the Greatness of the Name. Believing in the Name, peace is obtained. ||8||30||31||
Maajh, Third Mehl:
The Lord Himself is Unmanifest and Unrelated; He is Manifest and Related as well.
Those who recognize this essential reality are the true Pandits, the spiritual scholars.
They save themselves, and save all their families and ancestors as well, when they enshrine the Lord's Name in the mind. ||1||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who taste the essence of the Lord, and savor its taste.
Those who taste this essence of the Lord are the pure, immaculate beings. They meditate on the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Those who reflect upon the Shabad are beyond karma.
They subdue their ego, and find the essence of wisdom, deep within their being.
They obtain the nine treasures of the wealth of the Naam. Rising above the three qualities, they merge into the Lord. ||2||
Those who act in ego do not go beyond karma.
It is only by Guru's Grace that one is rid of ego.
Those who have discriminating minds, continually examine their own selves. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they sing the Lord's Glorious Praises. ||3||
The Lord is the most pure and sublime Ocean.
The Saintly Gurmukhs continually peck at the Naam, like swans pecking at pearls in the ocean.
They bathe in it continually, day and night, and the filth of ego is washed away. ||4||
The pure swans, with love and affection,
dwell in the Ocean of the Lord, and subdue their ego.
