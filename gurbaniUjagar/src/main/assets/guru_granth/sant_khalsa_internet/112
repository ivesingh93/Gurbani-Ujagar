Night and day, day and night, they burn. Without her Husband Lord, the soul-bride suffers in terrible pain. ||2||
Her body and her status shall not go with her to the world hereafter.
Where she is called to answer for her account, there, she shall be emancipated only by true actions.
Those who serve the True Guru shall prosper; here and hereafter, they are absorbed in the Naam. ||3||
She who adorns herself with the Love and the Fear of God,
by Guru's Grace, obtains the Mansion of the Lord's Presence as her home.
Night and day, day and night, she constantly ravishes and enjoys her Beloved. She is dyed in the permanent color of His Love. ||4||
The Husband Lord abides with everyone, always;
but how rare are those few who, by Guru's Grace, obtain His Glance of Grace.
My God is the Highest of the High; granting His Grace, He merges us into Himself. ||5||
This world is asleep in emotional attachment to Maya.
Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, it ultimately comes to ruin.
The One who put it to sleep shall also awaken it. Through the Guru's Teachings, understanding dawns. ||6||
One who drinks in this Nectar, shall have his delusions dispelled.
By Guru's Grace, the state of liberation is attained.
One who is imbued with devotion to the Lord, remains always balanced and detached. Subduing selfishness and conceit, he is united with the Lord. ||7||
He Himself creates, and He Himself assigns us to our tasks.
He Himself gives sustenance to the 8.4 million species of beings.
O Nanak, those who meditate on the Naam are attuned to Truth. They do that which is pleasing to His Will. ||8||4||5||
Maajh, Third Mehl:
Diamonds and rubies are produced deep within the self.
They are assayed and valued through the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Those who have gathered Truth, speak Truth; they apply the Touch-stone of Truth. ||1||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who enshrine the Word of the Guru's Bani within their minds.
In the midst of the darkness of the world, they obtain the Immaculate One, and their light merges into the Light. ||1||Pause||
Within this body are countless vast vistas;
the Immaculate Naam is totally Inaccessible and Infinite.
He alone becomes Gurmukh and obtains it, whom the Lord forgives, and unites with Himself. ||2||
My Lord and Master implants the Truth.
By Guru's Grace, one's consciousness is attached to the Truth.
The Truest of the True is pervading everywhere; the true ones merge in Truth. ||3||
The True Carefree Lord is my Beloved.
He cuts out our sinful mistakes and evil actions;
with love and affection, meditate forever on Him. He implants the Fear of God and loving devotional worship within us. ||4||
Devotional worship is True, if it pleases the True Lord.
He Himself bestows it; He does not regret it later.
He alone is the Giver of all beings. The Lord kills with the Word of His Shabad, and then revives. ||5||
Other than You, Lord, nothing is mine.
I serve You, Lord, and I praise You.
You unite me with Yourself, O True God. Through perfect good karma You are obtained. ||6||
For me, there is no other like You.
By Your Glance of Grace, my body is blessed and sanctified.
Night and day, the Lord takes care of us and protects us. The Gurmukhs are absorbed in intuitive peace and poise. ||7||
For me, there is no other as Great as You.
You Yourself create, and You Yourself destroy.
