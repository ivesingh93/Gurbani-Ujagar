He obtains his own home and mansion, by loving the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
As Gurmukh, I have obtained the Naam; I am a sacrifice to the Guru.
You Yourself embellish and adorn us, O Creator Lord. ||16||
Shalok, First Mehl:
When the lamp is lit, the darkness is dispelled;
reading the Vedas, sinful intellect is destroyed.
When the sun rises, the moon is not visible.
Wherever spiritual wisdom appears, ignorance is dispelled.
Reading the Vedas is the world's occupation;
the Pandits read them, study them and contemplate them.
Without understanding, all are ruined.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh is carried across. ||1||
First Mehl:
Those who do not savor the Word of the Shabad, do not love the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
They speak insipidly with their tongues, and are continually disgraced.
O Nanak, they act according to the karma of their past actions, which no one can erase. ||2||
Pauree:
One who praises his God, receives honor.
He drives out egotism from within himself, and enshrines the True Name within his mind.
Through the True Word of the Guru's Bani, he chants the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and finds true peace.
He is united with the Lord, after being separated for so long; the Guru, the Primal Being, unites him with the Lord.
In this way, his filthy mind is cleansed and purified, and he meditates on the Name of the Lord. ||17||
Shalok, First Mehl:
With the fresh leaves of the body, and the flowers of virtue, Nanak has weaved his garland.
The Lord is pleased with such garlands, so why pick any other flowers? ||1||
Second Mehl:
O Nanak, it is the spring season for those, within whose homes their Husband Lord abides.
But those, whose Husband Lord is far away in distant lands, continue burning, day and night. ||2||
Pauree:
The Merciful Lord Himself forgives those who dwell upon the Word of the Guru, the True Guru.
Night and day, I serve the True Lord, and chant His Glorious Praises; my mind merges into Him.
My God is infinite; no one knows His limit.
Grasping hold of the feet of the True Guru, meditate continually on the Lord's Name.
Thus you shall obtain the fruits of your desires, and all wishes shall be fulfilled within your home. ||18||
Shalok, First Mehl:
Spring brings forth the first blossoms, but the Lord blossoms earlier still.
By His blossoming, everything blossoms; no one else causes Him to blossom forth. ||1||
Second Mehl:
He blossoms forth even earlier than the spring; reflect upon Him.
O Nanak, praise the One who gives Support to all. ||2||
Second Mehl:
By uniting, the united one is not united; he unites, only if he is united.
But if he unites deep within his soul, then he is said to be united. ||3||
Pauree:
Praise the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and practice truthful deeds.
Attached to other deeds, one is consigned to wander in reincarnation.
Attuned to the Name, one obtains the Name, and through the Name, sings the Lord's Praises.
Praising the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he merges in the Lord's Name.
Service to the True Guru is fruitful and rewarding; serving Him, the fruits are obtained. ||19||
Shalok, Second Mehl:
Some people have others, but I am forlorn and dishonored; I have only You, Lord.
