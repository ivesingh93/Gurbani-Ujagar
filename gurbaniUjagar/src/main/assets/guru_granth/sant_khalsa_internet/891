he is intuitively in Samaadhi, profound and unfathomable.
He is liberated forever and all his affairs are perfectly resolved;
the Lord's Name abides within his heart. ||2||
He is totally peaceful, blissful and healthy;
he looks upon all impartially, and is perfectly detached.
He does not come and go, and he never wavers;
the Naam abides in his mind. ||3||
God is Merciful to the meek; He is the Lord of the World, the Lord of the Universe.
The Gurmukh meditates on Him, and his worries are gone.
The Guru has blessed Nanak with the Naam;
he serves the Saints, and works for the Saints. ||4||15||26||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
Sing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises, and the Beej Mantra, the Seed Mantra.
Even the homeless find a home in the world hereafter.
Fall at the feet of the Perfect Guru;
you have slept for so many incarnations - wake up! ||1||
Chant the Chant of the Lord's Name, Har, Har.
By Guru's Grace, it shall be enshrined within your heart, and you shall cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||Pause||
Meditate on the eternal treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, O mind,
and then, the screen of Maya shall be torn away.
Drink in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Guru's Shabad,
and then your soul shall be rendered immaculate and pure. ||2||
Searching, searching, searching, I have realized
that without devotional worship of the Lord, no one is saved.
So vibrate, and meditate on that Lord in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy;
your mind and body shall be imbued with love for the Lord. ||3||
Renounce all your cleverness and trickery.
O mind, without the Lord's Name, there is no place of rest.
The Lord of the Universe, the Lord of the World, has taken pity on me.
Nanak seeks the protection and support of the Lord, Har, Har. ||4||16||27||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
In the Saints' Congregation, play joyfully with the Lord,
and you will not have to meet the Messenger of Death hereafter.
Your egotistical intellect shall be dispelled,
and your evil-mindedness will be totally taken away. ||1||
Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord's Name, O Pandit.
Religious rituals and egotism are of no use at all. You shall go home with happiness, O Pandit. ||1||Pause||
I have earned the profit, the wealth of the Lord's praise.
All my hopes have been fulfilled.
Pain has left me, and peace has come to my home.
By the Grace of the Saints, my heart-lotus blossoms forth. ||2||
One who is blessed with the gift of the jewel of the Name,
obtains all treasures.
His mind becomes content, finding the Perfect Lord.
Why should he ever go begging again? ||3||
Hearing the Lord's sermon, he becomes pure and holy.
Chanting it with his tongue, he finds the way to salvation.
He alone is approved, who enshrines the Lord within his heart.
Nanak: such a humble being is exalted, O Siblings of Destiny. ||4||17||28||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
No matter how hard you try to grab it, it does not come into your hands.
No matter how much you may love it, it does not go along with you.
Says Nanak, when you abandon it,
then it comes and falls at your feet. ||1||
Listen, O Saints: this is the pure philosophy.
Without the Lord's Name, there is no salvation. Meeting with the Perfect Guru, one is saved. ||1||Pause||
