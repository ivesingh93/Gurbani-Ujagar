Nanak: You are near, so very near! ||3||3||156||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
I am intoxicated, intoxicated with the Love of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
I drink it in - I am drunk with it. The Guru has given it to me in charity.
My mind is drenched with it. ||1||
It is my furnace, it is the cooling plaster. It is my love, it is my longing.
My mind knows it as peace. ||2||
I enjoy intuitive peace, and I play in bliss; the cycle of reincarnation is ended for me, and I am merged with the Lord.
Nanak is pierced through with the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||3||4||157||
Raag Gauree Maalwaa, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Chant the Lord's Name; O my friend, chant it. Hereafter, the path is terrifying and treacherous. ||1||Pause||
Serve, serve, forever serve the Lord. Death hangs over your head.
Do seva, selfless service, for the Holy Saints, and the noose of Death shall be cut away. ||1||
You may make burnt offerings, sacrificial feasts and pilgrimages to sacred shrines in egotism, but your corruption only increases.
You are subject to both heaven and hell, and you are reincarnated over and over again. ||2||
The realm of Shiva, the realms of Brahma and Indra as well - no place anywhere is permanent.
Without serving the Lord, there is no peace at all. The faithless cynic comes and goes in reincarnation. ||3||
As the Guru has taught me, so have I spoken.
Says Nanak, listen, people: sing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises, and you shall be saved. ||4||1||158||
Raag Gauree Maalaa, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Adopting the innocent mind of a child, I have found peace.
Joy and sorrow, profit and loss, birth and death, pain and pleasure - they are all the same to my consciousness, since I met the Guru. ||1||Pause||
As long as I plotted and planned things, I was full of frustration.
When I met the Kind, Perfect Guru, then I obtained bliss so easily. ||1||
The more clever tricks I tried, the more bonds I was saddled with.
When the Holy Saint placed His Hand upon my forehead, then I was liberated. ||2||
As long as I claimed, "Mine, mine!", I was surrounded by wickedness and corruption.
But when I dedicated my mind, body and intellect to my Lord and Master, then I began to sleep in peace. ||3||
As long as I walked along, carrying the load, I continued to pay the fine.
But I threw away that bundle, when I met the Perfect Guru; O Nanak, then I became fearless. ||4||1||159||
Gauree Maalaa, Fifth Mehl:
I have renounced my desires; I have renounced them.
I have renounced them; meeting the Guru, I have renounced them.
All peace, joy, happiness and pleasures have come since I surrendered to the Will of the Lord of the Universe. ||1||Pause||
