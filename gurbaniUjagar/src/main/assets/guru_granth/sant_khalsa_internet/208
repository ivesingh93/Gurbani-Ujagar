Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
I came to the Guru, to learn the Way of Yoga.
The True Guru has revealed it to me through the Word of the Shabad. ||1||Pause||
He is contained in the nine continents of the world, and within this body; each and every moment, I humbly bow to Him.
I have made the Guru's Teachings my ear-rings, and I have enshrined the One Formless Lord within my being. ||1||
I have brought the five disciples together, and they are now under the control of the one mind.
When the ten hermits become obedient to the Lord, then I became an immaculate Yogi. ||2||
I have burnt my doubt, and smeared my body with the ashes. My path is to see the One and Only Lord.
I have made that intuitive peace my food; the Lord Master has written this pre-ordained destiny upon my forehead. ||3||
In that place where there is no fear, I have assumed my Yogic posture. The unstruck melody of His Bani is my horn.
I have made contemplation upon the essential reality my Yogic staff. The Love of the Name in my mind is my Yogic lifestyle. ||4||
By great good fortune, such a Yogi is met, who cuts away the bonds of Maya.
Nanak serves and adores this wondrous person, and kisses his feet. ||5||11||132||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is an incomparably beautiful treasure. Listen, everyone, and meditate on it, O friends.
Those, unto whom the Guru has given the Lord's medicine - their minds become pure and immaculate. ||1||Pause||
Darkness is dispelled from within that body, in which the Divine Light of the Guru's Shabad shines.
The noose of doubt is cut away from those who place their faith in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||1||
The treacherous and terrifying world-ocean is crossed over, in the boat of the Saadh Sangat.
My mind's desires are fulfilled, meeting the Guru, in love with the Lord. ||2||
The devotees have found the treasure of the Naam; their minds and bodies are satisfied and satiated.
O Nanak, the Dear Lord gives it only to those who surrender to the Lord's Command. ||3||12||133||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Please be kind and compassionate, O Lord of my life; I am helpless, and I seek Your Sanctuary, God.
Please, give me Your Hand, and lift me up, out of the deep dark pit. I have no clever tricks at all. ||1||Pause||
You are the Doer, the Cause of causes - You are everything. You are All-powerful; there is no other than You.
You alone know Your condition and extent. They alone become Your servants, upon whose foreheads such good destiny is recorded. ||1||
You are imbued with Your servant, God; Your devotees are woven into Your Fabric, through and through.
O Darling Beloved, they yearn for Your Name and the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, like the chakvee bird which longs to see the moon. ||2||
Between the Lord and His Saint, there is no difference at all. Among hundreds of thousands and millions, there is scarcely one humble being.
Those whose hearts are illuminated by God, sing the Kirtan of His Praises night and day with their tongues. ||3||
You are All-powerful and Infinite, the most lofty and exalted, the Giver of peace; O God, You are the Support of the breath of life.
Please show mercy to Nanak, O God, that he may remain in the Society of the Saints. ||4||13||134||
