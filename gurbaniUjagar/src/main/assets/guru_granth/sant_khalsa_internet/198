They alone are handsome, clever and wise,
who surrender to the Will of God. ||2||
Blessed is their coming into this world,
if they recognize their Lord and Master in each and every heart. ||3||
Says Nanak, their good fortune is perfect,
if they enshrine the Lord's Feet within their minds. ||4||90||159||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
The Lord's servant does not associate with the faithless cynic.
One is in the clutches of vice, while the other is in love with the Lord. ||1||Pause||
It would be like an imaginary rider on a decorated horse,
or a eunuch caressing a woman. ||1||
It would be like tying up an ox and trying to milk it,
or riding a cow to chase a tiger. ||2||
It would be like taking a sheep and worshipping it as the Elysian cow,
the giver of all blessings; it would be like going out shopping without any money. ||3||
O Nanak, consciously meditate on the Lord's Name.
Meditate in remembrance on the Lord Master, your Best Friend. ||4||91||160||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Pure and steady is that intellect,
which drinks in the Lord's sublime essence. ||1||
Keep the Support of the Lord's Feet in your heart,
and you shall be saved from the cycle of birth and death. ||1||Pause||
Pure is that body, in which sin does not arise.
In the Love of the Lord is pure glory. ||2||
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, corruption is eradicated.
This is the greatest blessing of all. ||3||
Imbued with loving devotional worship of the Sustainer of the Universe,
Nanak asks for the dust of the feet of the Holy. ||4||92||161||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Such is my love for the Lord of the Universe;
through perfect good destiny, I have been united with Him. ||1||Pause||
As the wife is delighted upon beholding her husband,
so does the Lord's humble servant live by chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||
As the mother is rejuvenated upon seeing her son,
so is the Lord's humble servant imbued with Him, through and through. ||2||
As the greedy man rejoices upon beholding his wealth,
so is the mind of the Lord's humble servant attached to His Lotus Feet. ||3||
May I never forget You, for even an instant, O Great Giver!
Nanak's God is the Support of his breath of life. ||4||93||162||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Those humble beings who are accustomed to the Lord's sublime essence,
are pierced through with loving devotional worship of the Lord's Lotus Feet. ||1||Pause||
All other pleasures look like ashes;
without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the world is fruitless. ||1||
He Himself rescues us from the deep dark well.
Wondrous and Glorious are the Praises of the Lord of the Universe. ||2||
In the woods and meadows, and throughout the three worlds, the Sustainer of the Universe is pervading.
The Expansive Lord God is Merciful to all beings. ||3||
Says Nanak, that speech alone is excellent,
which is approved by the Creator Lord. ||4||94||163||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Every day, take your bath in the Sacred Pool of the Lord.
Mix and drink in the most delicious, sublime Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
The water of the Name of the Lord of the Universe is immaculate and pure.
Take your cleansing bath in it, and all your affairs shall be resolved. ||1||
