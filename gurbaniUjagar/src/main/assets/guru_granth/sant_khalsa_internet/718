Todee, Fifth Mehl:
I have enshrined the Lord's Feet within my heart.
Contemplating my Lord and Master, my True Guru, all my affairs have been resolved. ||1||Pause||
The merits of giving donations to charity and devotional worship come from the Kirtan of the Praises of the Transcendent Lord; this is the true essence of wisdom.
Singing the Praises of the unapproachable, infinite Lord and Master, I have found immeasurable peace. ||1||
The Supreme Lord God does not consider the merits and demerits of those humble beings whom He makes His own.
Hearing, chanting and meditating on the jewel of the Naam, I live; Nanak wears the Lord as his necklace. ||2||11||30||
Todee, Ninth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
What can I say about my base nature?
I am entangled in the love of gold and women, and I have not sung the Kirtan of God's Praises. ||1||Pause||
I judge the false world to be true, and I have fallen in love with it.
I have never contemplated the friend of the poor, who shall be my companion and helper in the end. ||1||
I remain intoxicated by Maya, night and day, and the filth of my mind will not depart.
Says Nanak, now, without the Lord's Sanctuary, I cannot find salvation in any other way. ||2||1||31||
Todee, The Word Of The Devotees:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Some say that He is near, and others say that He is far away.
We might just as well say that the fish climbs out of the water, up the tree. ||1||
Why do you speak such nonsense?
One who has found the Lord, keeps quiet about it. ||1||Pause||
Those who become Pandits, religious scholars, recite the Vedas,
but foolish Naam Dayv knows only the Lord. ||2||1||
Whose blemishes remain, when one chants the Lord's Name?
Sinners become pure, chanting the Lord's Name. ||1||Pause||
With the Lord, servant Naam Dayv has come to have faith.
I have stopped fasting on the eleventh day of each month; why should I bother to go on pilgrimages to sacred shrines? ||1||
Prays Naam Dayv, I have become a man of good deeds and good thoughts.
Chanting the Lord's Name, under Guru's Instructions, who has not gone to heaven? ||2||2||
Here is a verse with a three-fold play on words. ||1||Pause||
In the potter's home there are pots, and in the king's home there are camels.
In the Brahmin's home there are widows. So here they are: haandee, saandee, raandee. ||1||
In the home of the grocer there is asafetida; on the forehead of the buffalo there are horns.
In the temple of Shiva there are lingams. So here they are: heeng, seeng, leeng. ||2||
In the house of the oil-presser there is oil; in the forest there are vines.
In the gardener's home there are bananas. So here they are: tayl, bayl, kayl. ||3||
The Lord of the Universe, Govind, is within His Saints; Krishna, Shyaam, is in Gokal.
The Lord, Raam, is in Naam Dayv. So here they are: Raam, Shyaam, Govind. ||4||3||
