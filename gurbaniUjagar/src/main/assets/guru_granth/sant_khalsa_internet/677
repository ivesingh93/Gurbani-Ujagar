Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
One who contemplates his Lord and Master - why should he be afraid?
The wretched self-willed manmukhs are ruined through fear and dread. ||1||Pause||
The Divine Guru, my mother and father, is over my head.
His image brings prosperity; serving Him, we become pure.
The One Lord, the Immaculate Lord, is our capital.
Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, we are illumined and enlightened. ||1||
The Giver of all beings is totally pervading everywhere.
Millions of pains are removed by the Lord's Name.
All the pains of birth and death are taken away
from the Gurmukh, within whose mind and body the Lord dwells. ||2||
He alone, whom the Lord has attached to the hem of His robe,
obtains a place in the Court of the Lord.
They alone are devotees, who are pleasing to the True Lord.
They are freed from the Messenger of Death. ||3||
True is the Lord, and True is His Court.
Who can contemplate and describe His value?
He is within each and every heart, the Support of all.
Nanak begs for the dust of the Saints. ||4||3||24||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
At home, and outside, I place my trust in You; You are always with Your humble servant.
Bestow Your Mercy, O my Beloved God, that I may chant the Lord's Name with love. ||1||
God is the strength of His humble servants.
Whatever You do, or cause to be done, O Lord and Master, that outcome is acceptable to me. ||Pause||
The Transcendent Lord is my honor; the Lord is my emancipation; the glorious sermon of the Lord is my wealth.
Slave Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord's feet; from the Saints, he has learned this way of life. ||2||1||25||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
God has fulfilled all my desires. Holding me close in His embrace, the Guru has saved me.
He has saved me from burning in the ocean of fire, and now, no one calls it impassible. ||1||
Those who have true faith in their minds,
continually behold the Glory of the Lord; they are forever happy and blissful. ||Pause||
I seek the Sanctuary of the feet of the Perfect Transcendent Lord, the Searcher of hearts; I behold Him ever-present.
In His wisdom, the Lord has made Nanak His own; He has preserved the roots of His devotees. ||2||2||26||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
Wherever I look, there I see Him present; He is never far away.
He is all-pervading, everywhere; O my mind, meditate on Him forever. ||1||
He alone is called your companion, who will not be separated from you, here or hereafter.
That pleasure, which passes away in an instant, is trivial. ||Pause||
He cherishes us, and gives us sustenance; He does not lack anything.
With each and every breath, my God takes care of His creatures. ||2||
God is undeceiveable, impenetrable and infinite; His form is lofty and exalted.
Chanting and meditating on the embodiment of wonder and beauty, His humble servants are in bliss. ||3||
Bless me with such understanding, O Merciful Lord God, that I might remember You.
