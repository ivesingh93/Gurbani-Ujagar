I place my pain and pleasure before Him.
He covers the faults of His humble servant.
Nanak sings His Praises. ||4||19||32||
Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
The whiner whines every day.
His attachment to his household and entanglements cloud his mind.
If someone becomes detached through understanding,
he will not have to suffer in birth and death again. ||1||
All of his conflicts are extensions of his corruption.
How rare is that person who takes the Naam as his Support. ||1||Pause||
The three-phased Maya infects all.
Whoever clings to it suffers pain and sorrow.
There is no peace without meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
By great good fortune, the treasure of the Naam is received. ||2||
One who loves the actor in his mind,
later regrets it when the actor takes off his costume.
The shade from a cloud is transitory,
like the worldly paraphernalia of attachment and corruption. ||3||
If someone is blessed with the singular substance,
then all of his tasks are accomplished to perfection.
One who obtains the Naam, by Guru's Grace-
O Nanak, his coming into the world is certified and approved. ||4||20||33||
Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
Slandering the Saints, the mortal wanders in reincarnation.
Slandering the Saints, he is diseased.
Slandering the Saints, he suffers in pain.
The slanderer is punished by the Messenger of Death. ||1||
Those who argue and fight with the Saints -
those slanderers find no happiness at all. ||1||Pause||
Slandering the devotees, the wall of the mortal's body is shattered.
Slandering the devotees, he suffers in hell.
Slandering the devotees, he rots in the womb.
Slandering the devotees, he loses his realm and power. ||2||
The slanderer finds no salvation at all.
He eats only that which he himself has planted.
He is worse than a thief, a lecher, or a gambler.
The slanderer places an unbearable burden upon his head. ||3||
The devotees of the Supreme Lord God are beyond hate and vengeance.
Whoever worships their feet is emancipated.
The Primal Lord God has deluded and confused the slanderer.
O Nanak, the record of one's past actions cannot be erased. ||4||21||34||
Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is for me the Vedas and the Sound-current of the Naad.
Through the Naam, my tasks are perfectly accomplished.
The Naam is my worship of deities.
The Naam is my service to the Guru. ||1||
The Perfect Guru has implanted the Naam within me.
The highest task of all is the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||Pause||
The Naam is my cleansing bath and purification.
The Naam is my perfect donation of charity.
Those who repeat the Naam are totally purified.
Those who chant the Naam are my friends and Siblings of Destiny. ||2||
The Naam is my auspicious omen and good fortune.
The Naam is the sublime food which satisfies me.
The Naam is my good conduct.
The Naam is my immaculate occupation. ||3||
All those humble beings whose minds are filled with the One God
have the Support of the Lord, Har, Har.
O Nanak, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord with your mind and body.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the Lord bestows His Name. ||4||22||35||
