Through the wealth of the Lord, I have forgotten my anxiety; through the wealth of the Lord, my doubt has been dispelled.
From the wealth of the Lord, I have obtained the nine treasures; the true essence of the Lord has come into my hands. ||3||
No matter how much I eat and expend this wealth, it is not exhausted; here and hereafter, it remains with me.
Loading the treasure, Guru Nanak has given it, and this mind is imbued with the Lord's Love. ||4||2||3||
Goojaree, Fifth Mehl:
Remembering Him, all sins are erased, and ones generations are saved.
So meditate continually on the Lord, Har, Har; He has no end or limitation. ||1||
O son, this is your mother's hope and prayer,
that you may never forget the Lord, Har, Har, even for an instant. May you ever vibrate upon the Lord of the Universe. ||1||Pause||
May the True Guru be kind to you, and may you love the Society of the Saints.
May the preservation of your honor by the Transcendent Lord be your clothes, and may the singing of His Praises be your food. ||2||
So drink in forever the Ambrosial Nectar; may you live long, and may the meditative remembrance of the Lord give you infinite delight.
May joy and pleasure be yours; may your hopes be fulfilled, and may you never be troubled by worries. ||3||
Let this mind of yours be the bumble bee, and let the Lord's feet be the lotus flower.
Says servant Nanak, attach your mind to them, and blossom forth like the song-bird, upon finding the rain-drop. ||4||3||4||
Goojaree, Fifth Mehl:
He decides to go to the west, but the Lord leads him away to the east.
In an instant, He establishes and disestablishes; He holds all matters in His hands. ||1||
Cleverness is of no use at all.
Whatever my Lord and Master deems to be right - that alone comes to pass. ||1||Pause||
In his desire to acquire land and accumulate wealth, one's breath escapes him.
He must leave all his armies, assistants and servants; rising up, he departs to the City of Death. ||2||
Believing himself to be unique, he clings to his stubborn mind, and shows himself off.
That food, which the blameless people have condemned and discarded, he eats again and again. ||3||
One, unto whom the Lord shows His natural mercy, has the noose of Death cut away from him.
Says Nanak, one who meets the Perfect Guru, is celebrated as a householder as well as a renunciate. ||4||4||5||
Goojaree, Fifth Mehl:
Those humble beings who chant the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, have their bonds broken.
Sexual desirer, anger, the poison of Maya and egotism - they are rid of these afflictions. ||1||
One who joins the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and chants the Praises of the Lord,
has his mind purified, by Guru's Grace, and he obtains the joy of all joys. ||1||Pause||
Whatever the Lord does, he sees that as good; such is the devotional service he performs.
He sees friends and enemies as all the same; this is the sign of the Way of Yoga. ||2||
The all-pervading Lord is fully filling all places; why should I go anywhere else?
He is permeating and pervading within each and every heart; I am immersed in His Love, dyed in the color of His Love. ||3||
When the Lord of the Universe becomes kind and compassionate, then one enters the home of the Fearless Lord.
