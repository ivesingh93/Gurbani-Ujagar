How have you escaped from the treachery of sexual desire, anger and egotism?
The holy beings, angels and demons of the three qualities, and all the worlds have been plundered. ||1||
The forest fire has burnt down so much of the grass; how rare are the plants which have remained green.
He is so All-powerful, that I cannot even describe Him; no one can chant His Praises. ||2||
In the store-room of the lamp-black, I did not turn black; my color remained immaculate and pure.
The Guru has implanted the Maha Mantra, the Great Mantra, within my heart, and I have heard the wondrous Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||3||
Showing His Mercy, God has looked upon me with favor, and He has attached me to His feet.
Through loving devotional worship, O Nanak, I have obtained peace; in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I am absorbed into the Lord. ||4||12||51||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Raag Aasaa, Seventh House, Fifth Mehl:
That red dress looks so beautiful on your body.
Your Husband Lord is pleased, and His heart is enticed. ||1||
Whose handiwork is this red beauty of yours?
Whose love has rendered the poppy so red? ||1||Pause||
You are so beautiful; you are the happy soul-bride.
Your Beloved is in your home; good fortune is in your home. ||2||
You are pure and chaste, you are most distinguished.
You are pleasing to Your Beloved, and you have sublime understanding. ||3||
I am pleasing to my Beloved, and so I am imbued with the deep red color.
Says Nanak, I have been totally blessed with the Lord's Glance of Grace. ||4||
Listen, O companions: this is my only work;
God Himself is the One who embellishes and adorns. ||1||Second. Pause||1||52||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
I suffered in pain, when I thought He was far away;
but now, He is Ever-present, and I receive His instructions. ||1||
My pride is gone, O friends and companions;
my doubt is dispelled, and the Guru has united me with my Beloved. ||1||Pause||
My Beloved has drawn me near to Him, and seated me on His Bed;
I have escaped the clutches of others. ||2||
In the mansion of my heart, shines the Light of the Shabad.
My Husband Lord is blissful and playful. ||3||
According to the destiny written upon my forehead, my Husband Lord has come home to me.
Servant Nanak has obtained the eternal marriage. ||4||2||53||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
My mind is attached to the True Name.
My dealings with other people are only superficial. ||1||
Outwardly, I am on good terms with all;
but I remain detached, like the lotus upon the water. ||1||Pause||
By word of mouth, I talk with everyone;
but I keep God clasped to my heart. ||2||
I may appear utterly terrible,
but my mind is the dust of all men's feet.
Servant Nanak has found the Perfect Guru.
