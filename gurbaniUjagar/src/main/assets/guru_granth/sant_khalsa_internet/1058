Through the True Name, one's actions are forever embellished. Without the Shabad, what can anyone do? ||7||
One instant, he laughs, and the next instant, he cries.
Because of duality and evil-mindedness, his affairs are not resolved.
Union and separation are pre-ordained by the Creator. Actions already committed cannot be taken back. ||8||
One who lives the Word of the Guru's Shabad becomes Jivan Mukta - liberated while yet alive.
He remains forever immersed in the Lord.
By Guru's Grace, one is blessed with glorious greatness; he is not afflicted by the disease of egotism. ||9||
Eating tasty delicacies, he fattens up his body
and wears religious robes, but he does not live to the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Deep with the nucleus of his being is the great disease; he suffers terrible pain, and eventually sinks into the manure. ||10||
He reads and studies the Vedas, and argues about them;
God is within his own heart, but he does not recognize the Word of the Shabad.
One who becomes Gurmukh churns the essence of reality; his tongue savors the sublime essence of the Lord. ||11||
Those who forsake the object within their own hearts, wander outside.
The blind, self-willed manmukhs do not taste the flavor of God.
Imbued with the taste of another, their tongues speak tasteless, insipid words. They never taste the sublime essence of the Lord. ||12||
The self-willed manmukh has doubt as his spouse.
He dies of evil-mindedness, and suffers forever.
His mind is attached to sexual desire, anger and duality, and he does not find peace, even in dreams. ||13||
The body becomes golden, with the Word of the Shabad as its spouse.
Night and day, enjoy the enjoyments, and be in love with the Lord.
Deep within the mansion of the self, one finds the Lord, who transcends this mansion. Realizing His Will, we merge in Him. ||14||
The Great Giver Himself gives.
No one has any power to stand against Him.
He Himself forgives, and unites us with the Shabad; The Word of His Shabad is unfathomable. ||15||
Body and soul, all belong to Him.
The True Lord is my only Lord and Master.
O Nanak, through the Word of the Guru's Bani, I have found the Lord. Chanting the Lord's Chant, I merge in Him. ||16||5||14||
Maaroo, Third Mehl:
The Gurmukh contemplates the sound current of the Naad instead of the Vedas.
The Gurmukh attains infinite spiritual wisdom and meditation.
The Gurmukh acts in harmony with God's Will; the Gurmukh finds perfection. ||1||
The mind of the Gurmukh turns away from the world.
The Gurmukh vibrates the Naad, the sound current of the Guru's Bani.
The Gurmukh, attuned to the Truth, remains detached, and dwells in the home of the self deep within. ||2||
I speak the Ambrosial Teachings of the Guru.
I lovingly chant the Truth, through the True Word of the Shabad.
My mind remains forever imbued with the Love of the True Lord. I am immersed in the Truest of the True. ||3||
Immaculate and pure is the mind of the Gurmukh, who bathes in the Pool of Truth.
No filth attaches to him; he merges in the True Lord.
He truly practices Truth forever; true devotion is implanted within him. ||4||
True is the speech of the Gurmukh; true are the eyes of the Gurmukh.
The Gurmukh practices and lives the Truth.
He speaks the Truth forever, day and night, and inspires others to speak the Truth. ||5||
True and exalted is the speech of the Gurmukh.
The Gurmukh speaks Truth, only Truth.
The Gurmukh serves the Truest of the True forever; the Gurmukh proclaims the Word of the Shabad. ||6||
