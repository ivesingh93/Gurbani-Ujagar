He has no family, and he has no mother.
The One and Only Lord is pervading and permeating deep within the nucleus of all. He is the Support of all beings. ||13||
Egotism, possessiveness, and the love of duality -
none of these shall go along with you; such is the pre-ordained will of our Lord and Master.
Through the True Guru, practice Truth, and the True Lord shall take away your pains. ||14||
If You so bless me, then I shall find lasting peace.
Through the True Word of the Shabad, I live the Truth.
The True Lord is within me, and my mind and body have become True. I am blessed with the overflowing treasure of devotional worship. ||15||
He Himself watches, and issues His Command.
He Himself inspires us to obey His Will.
O Nanak, only those who are attuned to the Naam are detached; their minds, bodies and tongues are embellished with the Naam. ||16||7||
Maaroo, Third Mehl:
He Himself created Himself, and came into being.
The One Lord is pervading in all, remaining hidden.
The Lord, the Life of the world, takes care of all. Whoever knows his own self, realizes God. ||1||
He who created Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva,
links each and every being to its tasks.
He merges into Himself, whoever is pleasing to His Will. The Gurmukh knows the One Lord. ||2||
The world is coming and going in reincarnation.
Attached to Maya, it dwells on its many sins.
One who realizes the Word of the Guru's Shabad, praises forever the eternal, unchanging True Lord. ||3||
Some are attached to the root - they find peace.
But those who are attached to the branches, waste their lives away uselessly.
Those humble beings, who chant the Name of the Ambrosial Lord, produce the ambrosial fruit. ||4||
I have no virtues; what words should I speak?
You see all, and weigh them on Your scale.
By Your will, You preserve me, and so do I remain. The Gurmukh knows the One Lord. ||5||
According to Your Will, You link me to my true tasks.
Renouncing vice, I am immersed in virtue.
The One Immaculate True Lord abides in virtue; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, He is realized. ||6||
Wherever I look, there I see Him.
Duality and evil-mindedness are destroyed through the Shabad.
The One Lord God is immersed in His Oneness. He is attuned forever to His own delight. ||7||
The body-lotus is withering away,
but the ignorant, self-willed manmukh does not understand the Shabad.
By Guru's Grace, he searches his body, and finds the Great Giver, the Life of the world. ||8||
The Lord frees up the body-fortress, which was seized by sins,
when one keeps the Dear Lord enshrined forever in the heart.
The fruits of his desires are obtained, and he is dyed in the permanent color of the Lord's Love. ||9||
The self-willed manmukh speaks of spiritual wisdom, but does not understand.
Again and again, he comes into the world, but he finds no place of rest.
The Gurmukh is spiritually wise, and praises the Lord forever. Throughout each and every age, the Gurmukh knows the One Lord. ||10||
All the deeds which the manmukh does bring pain - nothing but pain.
The Word of the Shabad is not within him; how can he go to the Court of the Lord?
The True Shabad dwells deep within the mind of the Gurmukh; he serves the Giver of peace forever. ||11||
