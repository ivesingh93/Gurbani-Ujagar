The Guru's Teachings are useful to my soul. ||1||
Chanting the Lord's Name in this way, my mind is satisfied.
I have obtained the ointment of spiritual wisdom, recognizing the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||1||Pause||
Blended with the One Lord, I enjoy intuitive peace.
Through the Immaculate Bani of the Word, my doubts have been dispelled.
Instead of the pale color of Maya, I am imbued with the deep crimson color of the Lord's Love.
By the Lord's Glance of Grace, the poison has been eliminated. ||2||
When I turned away, and became dead while yet alive, I was awakened.
Chanting the Word of the Shabad, my mind is attached to the Lord.
I have gathered in the Lord's sublime essence, and cast out the poison.
Abiding in His Love, the fear of death has run away. ||3||
My taste for pleasure ended, along with conflict and egotism.
My consciousness is attuned to the Lord, by the Order of the Infinite.
My pursuit for worldy pride and honour is over.
When He blessed me with His Glance of Grace, peace was established in my soul. ||4||
Without You, I see no friend at all.
Whom should I serve? Unto whom should I dedicate my consciousness?
Whom should I ask? At whose feet should I fall?
By whose teachings will I remain absorbed in His Love? ||5||
I serve the Guru, and I fall at the Guru's Feet.
I worship Him, and I am absorbed in the Lord's Name.
The Lord's Love is my instruction, sermon and food.
Enjoined to the Lord's Command, I have entered the home of my inner self. ||6||
With the extinction of pride, my soul has found peace and meditation.
The Divine Light has dawned, and I am absorbed in the Light.
Pre-ordained destiny cannot be erased; the Shabad is my banner and insignia.
I know the Creator, the Creator of His Creation. ||7||
I am not a learned Pandit, I am not clever or wise.
I do not wander; I am not deluded by doubt.
I do not speak empty speech; I have recognized the Hukam of His Command.
Nanak is absorbed in intuitive peace through the Guru's Teachings. ||8||1||
Gauree Gwaarayree, First Mehl:
The mind is an elephant in the forest of the body.
The Guru is the controlling stick; when the Insignia of the True Shabad is applied,
one obtains honor in the Court of God the King. ||1||
He cannot be known through clever tricks.
Without subduing the mind, how can His value be estimated? ||1||Pause||
In the house of the self is the Ambrosial Nectar, which is being stolen by the thieves.
No one can say no to them.
He Himself protects us, and blesses us with greatness. ||2||
There are billions, countless billions of fires of desire at the seat of the mind.
They are extinguished only with the water of understanding, imparted by the Guru.
Offering my mind, I have attained it, and I joyfully sing His Glorious Praises. ||3||
Just as He is within the home of the self, so is He beyond.
But how can I describe Him, sitting in a cave?
The Fearless Lord is in the oceans, just as He is in the mountains. ||4||
Tell me, who can kill someone who is already dead?
What does he fear? Who can frighten the fearless one?
He recognizes the Word of the Shabad, throughout the three worlds. ||5||
One who speaks, merely describes speech.
But one who understands, intuitively realizes.
Seeing and reflecting upon it, my mind surrenders. ||6||
Praise, beauty and liberation are in the One Name.
In it, the Immaculate Lord is permeating and pervading.
He dwells in the home of the self, and in His own sublime place. ||7||
The many silent sages lovingly praise Him.
