He Himself is the bow, and He Himself is the archer.
He Himself is all-wise, beautiful and all-knowing.
He is the speaker, the orator and the listener. He Himself made what is made. ||9||
Air is the Guru, and water is known to be the father.
The womb of the great mother earth gives birth to all.
Night and day are the two nurses, male and female; the world plays in this play. ||10||
You Yourself are the fish, and You Yourself are the net.
You Yourself are the cows, and You yourself are their keeper.
Your Light fills all the beings of the world; they walk according to Your Command, O God. ||11||
You Yourself are the Yogi, and You Yourself are the enjoyer.
You Yourself are the reveller; You form the supreme Union.
You Yourself are speechless, formless and fearless, absorbed in the primal ecstasy of deep meditation. ||12||
The sources of creation and speech are contained within You, Lord.
All that is seen, is coming and going.
They are the true bankers and traders, whom the True Guru has inspired to understand. ||13||
The Word of the Shabad is understood through the Perfect True Guru.
The True Lord is overflowing with all powers.
You are beyond our grasp, and forever independent. You do not have even an iota of greed. ||14||
Birth and death are meaningless, for those
who enjoy the sublime celestial essence of the Shabad within their minds.
He Himself is the Giver of liberation, satisfaction and blessings, to those devotees who love Him in their minds. ||15||
He Himself is immaculate; by contact with the Guru, spiritual wisdom is obtained.
Whatever is seen, shall merge into You.
Nanak, the lowly, begs for charity at Your Door; please, bless him with the glorious greatness of Your Name. ||16||1||
Maaroo, First Mehl:
He Himself is the earth, the mythical bull which supports it and the Akaashic ethers.
The True Lord Himself reveals His Glorious Virtues.
He Himself is celibate, chaste and contented; He Himself is the Doer of deeds. ||1||
He who created the creation, beholds what He has created.
No one can erase the Inscription of the True Lord.
He Himself is the Doer, the Cause of causes; He Himself is the One who bestows glorious greatness. ||2||
The five thieves cause the fickle consciousness to waver.
It looks into the homes of others, but does not search its own home.
The body-village crumbles into dust; without the Word of the Shabad, one's honor is lost. ||3||
One who realizes the Lord through the Guru, comprehends the three worlds.
He subdues his desires, and struggles with his mind.
Those who serve You, become just like You; O Fearless Lord, You are their best friend from infancy. ||4||
You Yourself are the heavenly realms, this world and the nether regions of the underworld.
You Yourself are the embodiment of light, forever young.
With matted hair, and a horrible, dreadful form, still, You have no form or feature. ||5||
The Vedas and the Bible do not know the mystery of God.
He has no mother, father, child or brother.
He created all the mountains, and levels them again; the Unseen Lord cannot be seen. ||6||
I have grown weary of making so many friends.
No one can rid me of my sins and mistakes.
God is the Supreme Lord and Master of all the angels and mortal beings; blessed with His Love, their fear is dispelled. ||7||
He puts back on the Path those who have wandered and strayed.
You Yourself make them stray, and You teach them again.
I cannot see anything except the Name. Through the Name comes salvation and merit. ||8||
