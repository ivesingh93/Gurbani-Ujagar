What is that virtue, by which I may sing of You?
What is that speech, by which I may please the Supreme Lord God? ||1||Pause||
What worship service shall I perform for You?
How can I cross over the terrifying world-ocean? ||2||
What is that penance, by which I may become a penitent?
What is that Name, by which the filth of egotism may be washed away? ||3||
Virtue, worship, spiritual wisdom, meditation and all service, O Nanak,
are obtained from the True Guru, when, in His Mercy and Kindness, He meets us. ||4||
They alone receive this merit, and they alone know God,
who are approved by the Giver of peace. ||1||Second. Pause||36||105||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
The body which you are so proud of, does not belong to you.
Power, property and wealth are not yours. ||1||
They are not yours, so why do you cling to them?
Only the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is yours; it is received from the True Guru. ||1||Pause||
Children, spouse and siblings are not yours.
Dear friends, mother and father are not yours. ||2||
Gold, silver and money are not yours.
Fine horses and magnificent elephants are of no use to you. ||3||
Says Nanak, those whom the Guru forgives, meet with the Lord.
Everything belongs to those who have the Lord as their King. ||4||37||106||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
I place the Guru's Feet on my forehead,
and all my pains are gone. ||1||
I am a sacrifice to my True Guru.
I have come to understand my soul, and I enjoy supreme bliss. ||1||Pause||
I have applied the dust of the Guru's Feet to my face,
which has removed all my arrogant intellect. ||2||
The Word of the Guru's Shabad has become sweet to my mind,
and I behold the Supreme Lord God. ||3||
The Guru is the Giver of peace; the Guru is the Creator.
O Nanak, the Guru is the Support of the breath of life and the soul. ||4||38||107||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
O my mind, seek the One,
who lacks nothing. ||1||
Make the Beloved Lord your friend.
Keep Him constantly in your mind; He is the Support of the breath of life. ||1||Pause||
O my mind, serve Him;
He is the Primal Being, the Infinite Divine Lord. ||2||
Place your hopes in the One
who is the Support of all beings, from the very beginning of time, and throughout the ages. ||3||
His Love brings eternal peace;
meeting the Guru, Nanak sings His Glorious Praises. ||4||39||108||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Whatever my Friend does, I accept.
My Friend's actions are pleasing to me. ||1||
Within my conscious mind, the One Lord is my only Support.
One who does this is my Friend. ||1||Pause||
My Friend is Carefree.
By Guru's Grace, I give my love to Him. ||2||
My Friend is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.
He is the All-powerful Being, the Supreme Lord and Master. ||3||
I am Your servant; You are my Lord and Master.
