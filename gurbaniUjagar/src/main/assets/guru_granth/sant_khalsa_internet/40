Thousands of clever mental tricks have been tried, but still, the raw and undisciplined mind does not absorb the Color of the Lord's Love.
By falsehood and deception, none have found Him. Whatever you plant, you shall eat. ||3||
O God, You are the Hope of all. All beings are Yours; You are the Wealth of all.
O God, none return from You empty-handed; at Your Door, the Gurmukhs are praised and acclaimed.
In the terrifying world-ocean of poison, people are drowning-please lift them up and save them! This is servant Nanak's humble prayer. ||4||1||65||
Siree Raag, Fourth Mehl:
Receiving the Naam, the mind is satisfied; without the Naam, life is cursed.
If I meet the Gurmukh, my Spiritual Friend, he will show me God, the Treasure of Excellence.
I am every bit a sacrifice to one who reveals to me the Naam. ||1||
O my Beloved, I live by meditating on Your Name.
Without Your Name, my life does not even exist. My True Guru has implanted the Naam within me. ||1||Pause||
The Naam is a Priceless Jewel; it is with the Perfect True Guru.
When one is enjoined to serve the True Guru, He brings out this Jewel and bestows this enlightenment.
Blessed, and most fortunate of the very fortunate, are those who come to meet the Guru. ||2||
Those who have not met the Primal Being, the True Guru, are most unfortunate, and are subject to death.
They wander in reincarnation over and over again, as the most disgusting maggots in manure.
Do not meet with, or even approach those people, whose hearts are filled with horrible anger. ||3||
The True Guru, the Primal Being, is the Pool of Ambrosial Nectar. The very fortunate ones come to bathe in it.
The filth of many incarnations is washed away, and the Immaculate Naam is implanted within.
Servant Nanak has obtained the most exalted state, lovingly attuned to the True Guru. ||4||2||66||
Siree Raag, Fourth Mehl:
I sing His Glories, I describe His Glories, I speak of His Glories, O my mother.
The Gurmukhs, my spiritual friends, bestow virtue. Meeting with my spiritual friends, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
The Diamond of the Guru has pierced the diamond of my mind, which is now dyed in the deep crimson color of the Name. ||1||
O my Lord of the Universe, singing Your Glorious Praises, my mind is satisfied.
Within me is the thirst for the Lord's Name; may the Guru, in His Pleasure, grant it to me. ||1||Pause||
Let your minds be imbued with His Love, O blessed and fortunate ones. By His Pleasure, the Guru bestows His Gifts.
The Guru has lovingly implanted the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within me; I am a sacrifice to the True Guru.
Without the True Guru, the Name of the Lord is not found, even though people may perform hundreds of thousands, even millions of rituals. ||2||
Without destiny, the True Guru is not found, even though He sits within the home of our own inner being, always near and close at hand.
There is ignorance within, and the pain of doubt, like a separating screen.
Without meeting with the True Guru, no one is transformed into gold. The self-willed manmukh sinks like iron, while the boat is very close. ||3||
The Boat of the True Guru is the Name of the Lord. How can we climb on board?
One who walks in harmony with the True Guru's Will comes to sit in this Boat.
Blessed, blessed are those very fortunate ones, O Nanak, who are united with the Lord through the True Guru. ||4||3||67||
