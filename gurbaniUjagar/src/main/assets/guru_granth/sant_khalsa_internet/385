Inwardly and outwardly, He has shown me the One Lord. ||4||3||54||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The mortal revels in joy, in the vigor of youth;
but without the Name, he mingles with dust. ||1||
He may wear ear-rings and fine clothes,
and have a comfortable bed, and his mind may be so proud. ||1||Pause||
He may have elephants to ride, and golden umbrellas over his head;
but without devotional worship to the Lord, he is buried beneath the dirt. ||2||
He may enjoy many women, of exquisite beauty;
but without the sublime essence of the Lord, all tastes are tasteless. ||3||
Deluded by Maya, the mortal is led into sin and corruption.
Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of God, the All-powerful, Compassionate Lord. ||4||4||55||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
There is a garden, in which so many plants have grown.
They bear the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam as their fruit. ||1||
Consider this, O wise one,
by which you may attain the state of Nirvaanaa.
All around this garden are pools of poison, but within it is the Ambrosial Nectar, O Siblings of Destiny. ||1||Pause||
There is only one gardener who tends it.
He takes care of every leaf and branch. ||2||
He brings all sorts of plants and plants them there.
They all bear fruit - none is without fruit. ||3||
One who receives the Ambrosial Fruit of the Naam from the Guru -
O Nanak, such a servant crosses over the ocean of Maya. ||4||5||56||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The pleasures of royalty are derived from Your Name.
I attain Yoga, singing the Kirtan of Your Praises. ||1||
All comforts are obtained in Your Shelter.
The True Guru has removed the veil of doubt. ||1||Pause||
Understanding the Command of the Lord's Will, I revel in pleasure and joy.
Serving the True Guru, I obtain the supreme state of Nirvaanaa. ||2||
One who recognizes You is recognized as a householder, and as a renunciate.
Imbued with the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he dwells in Nirvaanaa. ||3||
One who has obtained the treasure of the Naam -
prays Nanak, his treasure-house is filled to overflowing. ||4||6||57||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Journeying to sacred shrines of pilgrimage, I see the mortals acting in ego.
If I ask the Pandits, I find them tainted by Maya. ||1||
Show me that place, O friend,
where the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises are forever sung. ||1||Pause||
The Shaastras and the Vedas speak of sin and virtue;
they say that mortals are reincarnated into heaven and hell, over and over again. ||2||
In the householder's life, there is anxiety, and in the life of the renunciate, there is egotism.
Performing religious rituals, the soul is entangled. ||3||
By God's Grace, the mind is brought under control;
O Nanak, the Gurmukh crosses over the ocean of Maya. ||4||
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, sing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises.
This place is found through the Guru. ||1||Second. Pause||7||58||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Within my home there is peace, and outwardly there is peace as well.
Remembering the Lord in meditation, all pains are erased. ||1||
There is total peace, when You come into my mind.
