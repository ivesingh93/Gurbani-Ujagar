The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is pleasing to my mind.
By great good fortune, I meditate on the Lord's Name.
The Perfect Guru has attained spiritual perfection in the Name of the Lord. How rare are those who follow the Guru's Teachings. ||1||

The Companion of my breath of life shall always be with me.
The Perfect Guru has implanted the Lord's Name within me. I have the Imperishable Treasure of the Lord in my lap. ||2||
The Lord, Har, Har, is my Best Friend; He is my Beloved Lord King.
If only someone would come and introduce me to Him, the Rejuvenator of my breath of life.

Maajh, Fourth Mehl:
The Lord is my mind, body and breath of life.
I do not know any other than the Lord.
If only I could have the good fortune to meet some friendly Saint; he might show me the Way to my Beloved Lord God. ||1||
I have searched my mind and body, through and through.
How can I meet my Darling Beloved, O my mother?
Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, I ask about the Path to God. In that Congregation, the Lord God abides. ||2||
My Darling Beloved True Guru is my Protector.
I am a helpless child-please cherish me.
The Guru, the Perfect True Guru, is my Mother and Father. Obtaining the Water of the Guru, the lotus of my heart blossoms forth. ||3||
Without seeing my Guru, sleep does not come.
My mind and body are afflicted with the pain of separation from the Guru.
O Lord, Har, Har, show mercy to me, that I may meet my Guru. Meeting the Guru, servant Nanak blossoms forth. ||4||2||
