Within the body-village is the Lord's supreme, sublime essence. How can I obtain it? Teach me, O humble Saints.
Serving the True Guru, you shall obtain the Fruitful Vision of the Lord's Darshan; meeting Him, drink in the ambrosial essence of the Lord's Nectar. ||2||
The Ambrosial Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is so sweet; O Saints of the Lord, taste it, and see.
Under Guru's Instruction, the Lord's essence seems so sweet; through it, all corrupt sensual pleasures are forgotten. ||3||
The Name of the Lord is the medicine to cure all diseases; so serve the Lord, O humble Saints.
The four great blessings are obtained, O Nanak, by vibrating upon the Lord, under Guru's Instruction. ||4||4||
Bilaaval, Fourth Mehl:
Anyone, from any class - Kshatriya, Brahman, Soodra or Vaisya - can chant, and meditate on the Mantra of the Lord's Name.
Worship the Guru, the True Guru, as the Supreme Lord God; serve Him constantly, all day and night. ||1||
O humble servants of the Lord, behold the True Guru with your eyes.
Whatever you wish for, you shall receive, chanting the Word of the Lord's Name, under Guru's Instruction. ||1||Pause||
People think of many and various efforts, but that alone happens, which is to happen.
All beings seek goodness for themselves, but what the Lord does - that may not be what we think and expect. ||2||
So renounce the clever intellect of your mind, O humble servants of the Lord, no matter how hard this may be.
Night and day, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; accept the wisdom of the Guru, the True Guru. ||3||
Wisdom, balanced wisdom is in Your power, O Lord and Master; I am the instrument, and You are the player, O Primal Lord.
O God, O Creator, Lord and Master of servant Nanak, as You wish, so do I speak. ||4||5||
Bilaaval, Fourth Mehl:
I meditate on the source of bliss, the Sublime Primal Being; night and day, I am in ecstasy and bliss.
The Righteous Judge of Dharma has no power over me; I have cast off all subservience to the Messenger of Death. ||1||
Meditate, O mind, on the Naam, the Name of the Lord of the Universe.
By great good fortune, I have found the Guru, the True Guru; I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of supreme bliss. ||1||Pause||
The foolish faithless cynics are held captive by Maya; in Maya, they continue wandering, wandering around.
Burnt by desire, and bound by the karma of their past actions, they go round and round, like the ox at the mill press. ||2||
The Gurmukhs, who focus on serving the Guru, are saved; by great good fortune, they perform service.
Those who meditate on the Lord obtain the fruits of their rewards, and the bonds of Maya are all broken. ||3||
He Himself is the Lord and Master, and He Himself is the servant. The Lord of the Universe Himself is all by Himself.
O servant Nanak, He Himself is All-pervading; as He keeps us, we remain. ||4||6||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Raag Bilaaval, Fourth Mehl, Partaal, Thirteenth House:
O Siblings of Destiny, chant the Name of the Lord, the Purifier of sinners.
The Lord emancipates his Saints and devotees.
