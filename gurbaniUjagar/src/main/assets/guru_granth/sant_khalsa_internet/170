I have tasted the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, by meeting the True Guru. It is sweet, like the juice of the sugarcane. ||2||
Those who have not met the Guru, the True Guru, are foolish and insane - they are faithless cynics.
Those who were pre-ordained to have no good karma at all - gazing into the lamp of emotional attachment, they are burnt, like moths in a flame. ||3||
Those whom You, in Your Mercy, have met, Lord, are committed to Your Service.
Servant Nanak chants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har. He is famous, and through the Guru's Teachings, He merges in the Name. ||4||4||18||56||
Gauree Poorbee, Fourth Mehl:
O my mind, God is always with you; He is your Lord and Master. Tell me, where could you run to get away from the Lord?
The True Lord God Himself grants forgiveness; we are emancipated only when the Lord Himself emancipates us. ||1||
O my mind, chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har - chant it in your mind.
Quickly now, run to the Sanctuary of the True Guru, O my mind; following the Guru, the True Guru, you shall be saved. ||1||Pause||
O my mind, serve God, the Giver of all peace; serving Him, you shall come to dwell in your own home deep within.
As Gurmukh, go and enter your own home; anoint yourself with the sandalwood oil of the Lord's Praises. ||2||
O my mind, the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har, Har, are exalted and sublime. Earn the profit of the Lord's Name, and let your mind be happy.
If the Lord, Har, Har, in His Mercy, bestows it, then we partake of the ambrosial essence of the Lord's Name. ||3||
O my mind, without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and attached to duality, those faithless cynics are strangled by the Messenger of Death.
Such faithless cynics, who have forgotten the Naam, are thieves. O my mind, do not even go near them. ||4||
O my mind, serve the Unknowable and Immaculate Lord, the Man-lion; serving Him, your account will be cleared.
The Lord God has made servant Nanak perfect; he is not diminished by even the tiniest particle. ||5||5||19||57||
Gauree Poorbee, Fourth Mehl:
My breath of life is in Your Power, God; my soul and body are totally Yours.
Be merciful to me, and show me the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. There is such a great longing within my mind and body! ||1||
O my Lord, there is such a great longing within my mind and body to meet the Lord.
When the Guru, the Merciful Guru, showed just a little mercy to me, my Lord God came and met me. ||1||Pause||
Whatever is in my conscious mind, O Lord and Master - that condition of mine is known only to You, Lord.
Night and day, I chant Your Name, and I find peace. I live by placing my hopes in You, Lord. ||2||
The Guru, the True Guru, the Giver, has shown me the Way; my Lord God came and met me.
Night and day, I am filled with bliss; by great good fortune, all of the hopes of His humble servant have been fulfilled. ||3||
O Lord of the World, Master of the Universe, everything is under Your control.
Servant Nanak has come to Your Sanctuary, Lord; please, preserve the honor of Your humble servant. ||4||6||20||58||
Gauree Poorbee, Fourth Mehl:
This mind does not hold still, even for an instant. Distracted by all sorts of distractions, it wanders around aimlessly in the ten directions.
