My mind is imbued with love for the Naam. The Immaculate Lord is merciful, from the beginning of time, and throughout the ages. ||3||
My mind is fascinated with the Fascinating Lord. By great good fortune, I am lovingly attuned to Him.
Contemplating the True Lord, all the resides of sins and mistakes are wiped away. My mind is pure and immaculate in His Love. ||4||
God is the Deep and Unfathomable Ocean, the Source of all jewels; no other is worthy of worship.
I contemplate the Shabad, the Destroyer of doubt and fear; I do not know any other at all. ||5||
Subduing my mind, I have realized the pure status; I am totally imbued with the sublime essence of the Lord.
I do not know any other except the Lord. The True Guru has imparted this understanding. ||6||
God is Inaccessible and Unfathomable, Unmastered and Unborn; through the Guru's Teachings, I know the One Lord.
Filled to overflowing, my consciousness does not waver; through the Mind, my mind is pleased and appeased. ||7||
By Guru's Grace, I speak the Unspoken; I speak what He makes me speak.
O Nanak, my Lord is Merciful to the meek; I do not know any other at all. ||8||2||
Saarang, Third Mehl, Ashtapadees, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O my mind, the Name of the Lord is glorious and great.
I know of none, other than the Lord; through the Lord's Name, I have attained liberation and emancipation. ||1||Pause||
Through the Word of the Shabad, I am lovingly attuned to the Lord, the Destroyer of fear, the Destroyer of the Messenger of Death.
As Gurmukh, I have realized the Lord, the Giver of peace; I remain intuitively absorbed in Him. ||1||
The Immaculate Name of the Lord is the food of His devotees; they wear the glory of devotional worship.
They abide in the home of their inner beings, and they serve the Lord forever; they are honored in the Court of the Lord. ||2||
The intellect of the self-willed manmukh is false; his mind wavers and wobbles, and he cannot speak the Unspoken Speech.
Following the Guru's Teachings, the Eternal Unchanging Lord abides within the mind; the True Word of His Bani is Ambrosial Nectar. ||3||
The Shabad calms the turbulent waves of the mind; the tongue is intuitively imbued with peace.
So remain united forever with your True Guru, who is lovingly attuned to the Lord. ||4||
If the mortal dies in the Shabad, then he is liberated; he focuses his consciousness on the Lord's Feet.
The Lord is an Ocean; His Water is Forever Pure. Whoever bathes in it is intuitively imbued with peace. ||5||
Those who contemplate the Shabad are forever imbued with His Love; their egotism and desires are subdued.
The Pure, Unattached Lord permeates their inner beings; the Lord, the Supreme Soul, is pervading all. ||6||
Your humble servants serve You, O Lord; those who are imbued with the Truth are pleasing to Your Mind.
Those who are involved in duality do not find the Mansion of the Lord's Presence; caught in the false nature of the world, they do not discriminate between merits and demerits. ||7||
When the Lord merges us into Himself, we speak the Unspoken Speech; True is the Shabad, and True is the Word of His Bani.
O Nanak, the true people are absorbed in the Truth; they chant the Name of the Lord. ||8||1||
Saarang, Third Mehl:
O my mind, the Name of the Lord is supremely sweet.
