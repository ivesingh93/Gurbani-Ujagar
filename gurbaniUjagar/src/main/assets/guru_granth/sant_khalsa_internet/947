One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Vaar Of Raamkalee, Third Mehl,
To Be Sung To The Tune Of 'Jodha And Veera Poorbaanee':
Shalok, Third Mehl:
The True Guru is the field of intuitive wisdom. One who is inspired to love Him,
plants the seed of the Name there. The Name sprouts up, and he remains absorbed in the Name.
But this egotism is the seed of skepticism; it has been uprooted.
It is not planted there, and it does not sprout; whatever God grants us, we eat.
When water mixes with water, it cannot be separated again.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh is wonderful; come, people, and see!
But what can the poor people see? They do not understand.
He alone sees, whom the Lord causes to see; the Lord comes to dwell in his mind. ||1||
Third Mehl:
The self-willed manmukh is the field of sorrow and suffering. He plains sorrow, and eats sorrow.
In sorrow he is born, and in sorrow he dies. Acting in egotism, his life passes away.
He does not understand the coming and going of reincarnation; the blind man acts in blindness.
He does not know the One who gives, but he is attached to what is given.
O Nanak, he acts according to his pre-ordained destiny. He cannot do anything else. ||2||
Third Mehl:
Meeting the True Guru, everlasting peace is obtained. He Himself leads us to meet Him.
This is the true meaning of peace, that one becomes immaculate within oneself.
The doubt of ignorance is eradicated, and spiritual wisdom is obtained.
Nanak comes to gaze upon the One Lord alone; wherever he looks, there He is. ||3||
Pauree:
The True Lord created His throne, upon which He sits.
He Himself is everything; this is what the Word of the Guru's Shabad says.
Through His almighty creative power, He created and fashioned the mansions and hotels.
He made the two lamps, the sun and the moon; He formed the perfect form.
He Himself sees, and He Himself hears; meditate on the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||1||
Waaho! Waaho! Hail, hail, O True King! True is Your Name. ||1||Pause||
Shalok:
Kabeer, I have ground myself into henna paste.
O my Husband Lord, You took no notice of me; You never applied me to Your feet. ||1||
Third Mehl:
O Nanak, my Husband Lord keeps me like henna paste; He blesses me with His Glance of Grace.
He Himself grinds me, and He Himself rubs me; He Himself applies me to His feet.
This is the cup of love of my Lord and Master; He gives it as He chooses. ||2||
Pauree:
You created the world with its variety; by the Hukam of Your Command, it comes, goes, and merges again in You.
You Yourself see, and blossom forth; there is no one else at all.
As it pleases You, You keep me. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I understand You.
You are the strength of all. As it pleases You, You lead us on.
There is no other as great as You; unto whom should I speak and talk? ||2||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Deluded by doubt, I wandered over the whole world. Searching, I became frustrated.
