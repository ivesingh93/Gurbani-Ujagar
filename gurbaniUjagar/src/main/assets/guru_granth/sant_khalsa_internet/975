Raag Nat Naaraayan, Fourth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:
O my mind, chant the Name of the Lord, day and night.
Millions and millions of sins and mistakes, committed through countless lifetimes, shall all be put aside and sent away. ||1||Pause||
Those who chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and worship Him in adoration, and serve Him with love, are genuine.
All their sins are erased, just as water washes off the dirt. ||1||
That being, who sings the Lord's Praises each and every instant, chants with his mouth the Name of the Lord.
In a moment, in an instant, the Lord rids him of the five incurable diseases of the body-village. ||2||
Very fortunate are those who meditate on the Lord's Name; they alone are the Lord's devotees.
I beg for the Sangat, the Congregation; O God, please bless me with them. I am a fool, and an idiot - please save me! ||3||
Shower me with Your Mercy and Grace, O Life of the World; save me, I seek Your Sanctuary.
Servant Nanak has entered Your Sanctuary; O Lord, please preserve my honor! ||4||1||
Nat, Fourth Mehl:
Meditating on the Lord, His humble servants are blended with the Lord's Name.
Chanting the Lord's Name, following the Guru's Teachings, the Lord showers His Mercy upon them. ||1||Pause||
Our Lord and Master, Har, Har, is inaccessible and unfathomable. Meditating on Him, His humble servant merges with Him, like water with water.
Meeting with the Lord's Saints, I have obtained the sublime essence of the Lord. I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to His humble servants. ||1||
The Lord's humble servant sings the Praises of the Name of the Supreme, Primal Soul, and all poverty and pain are destroyed.
Within the body are the five evil and uncontrollable passions. The Lord destroys them in an instant. ||2||
The Lord's Saint loves the Lord in his mind, like the lotus flower gazing at the moon.
The clouds hang low, the clouds tremble with thunder, and the mind dances joyfully like the peacock. ||3||
My Lord and Master has placed this yearning within me; I live by seeing and meeting my Lord.
Servant Nanak is addicted to the intoxication of the Lord; meeting with the Lord, he finds sublime bliss. ||4||2||
Nat, Fourth Mehl:
O my mind, chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, your only Friend.
