Jaitsree, Fourth Mehl, First House, Chau-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The Jewel of the Lord's Name abides within my heart; the Guru has placed His hand on my forehead.
The sins and pains of countless incarnations have been cast out. The Guru has blessed me with the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and my debt has been paid off. ||1||
O my mind, vibrate the Lord's Name, and all your affairs shall be resolved.
The Perfect Guru has implanted the Lord's Name within me; without the Name, life is useless. ||Pause||
Without the Guru, the self-willed manmukhs are foolish and ignorant; they are forever entangled in emotional attachment to Maya.
They never serve the feet of the Holy; their lives are totally useless. ||2||
Those who serve at the feet of the Holy, the feet of the Holy, their lives are made fruitful, and they belong to the Lord.
Make me the slave of the slave of the slaves of the Lord; bless me with Your Mercy, O Lord of the Universe. ||3||
I am blind, ignorant and totally without wisdom; how can I walk on the Path?
I am blind - O Guru, please let me grasp the hem of Your robe, so that servant Nanak may walk in harmony with You. ||4||1||
Jaitsree, Fourth Mehl:
A jewel or a diamond may be very valuable and heavy, but without a purchaser, it is worth only straw.
When the Holy Guru, the Purchaser, saw this jewel, He purchased it for hundreds of thousands of dollars. ||1||
The Lord has kept this jewel hidden within my mind.
The Lord, merciful to the meek, led me to meet the Holy Guru; meeting the Guru, I came to appreciate this jewel. ||Pause||
The rooms of the self-willed manmukhs are dark with ignorance; in their homes, the jewel is not visible.
Those fools die, wandering in the wilderness, eating the poison of the snake, Maya. ||2||
O Lord, Har, Har, let me meet the humble, holy beings; O Lord, keep me in the Sanctuary of the Holy.
O Lord, make me Your own; O God, Lord and Master, I have hurried to Your side. ||3||
What Glorious Virtues of Yours can I speak and describe? You are great and unfathomable, the Greatest Being.
The Lord has bestowed His Mercy on servant Nanak; He has saved the sinking stone. ||4||2||
