In various costumes, like actors, they appear.
As it pleases God, they dance.
Whatever pleases Him, comes to pass.
O Nanak, there is no other at all. ||7||
Sometimes, this being attains the Company of the Holy.
From that place, he does not have to come back again.
The light of spiritual wisdom dawns within.
That place does not perish.
The mind and body are imbued with the Love of the Naam, the Name of the One Lord.
He dwells forever with the Supreme Lord God.
As water comes to blend with water,
his light blends into the Light.
Reincarnation is ended, and eternal peace is found.
Nanak is forever a sacrifice to God. ||8||11||
Shalok:
The humble beings abide in peace; subduing egotism, they are meek.
The very proud and arrogant persons, O Nanak, are consumed by their own pride. ||1||
Ashtapadee:
One who has the pride of power within,
shall dwell in hell, and become a dog.
One who deems himself to have the beauty of youth,
shall become a maggot in manure.
One who claims to act virtuously,
shall live and die, wandering through countless reincarnations.
One who takes pride in wealth and lands
is a fool, blind and ignorant.
One whose heart is mercifully blessed with abiding humility,
O Nanak, is liberated here, and obtains peace hereafter. ||1||
One who becomes wealthy and takes pride in it -
not even a piece of straw shall go along with him.
He may place his hopes on a large army of men,
but he shall vanish in an instant.
One who deems himself to be the strongest of all,
in an instant, shall be reduced to ashes.
One who thinks of no one else except his own prideful self -
the Righteous Judge of Dharma shall expose his disgrace.
One who, by Guru's Grace, eliminates his ego,
O Nanak, becomes acceptable in the Court of the Lord. ||2||
If someone does millions of good deeds, while acting in ego,
he shall incur only trouble; all this is in vain.
If someone performs great penance, while acting in selfishness and conceit,
he shall be reincarnated into heaven and hell, over and over again.
He makes all sorts of efforts, but his soul is still not softened -
how can he go to the Court of the Lord?
One who calls himself good -
goodness shall not draw near him.
One whose mind is the dust of all -
says Nanak, his reputation is spotlessly pure. ||3||
As long as someone thinks that he is the one who acts,
he shall have no peace.
As long as this mortal thinks that he is the one who does things,
he shall wander in reincarnation through the womb.
As long as he considers one an enemy, and another a friend,
his mind shall not come to rest.
As long as he is intoxicated with attachment to Maya,
the Righteous Judge shall punish him.
By God's Grace, his bonds are shattered;
by Guru's Grace, O Nanak, his ego is eliminated. ||4||
Earning a thousand, he runs after a hundred thousand.
