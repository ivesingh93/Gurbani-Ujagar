The Primal Lord has ordained that mortals must practice righteousness. ||3||
Shalok, Second Mehl:
The month of Saawan has come, O my companions; think of your Husband Lord.
O Nanak, the discarded bride is in love with another; now she weeps and wails, and dies. ||1||
Second Mehl:
The month of Saawan has come, O my companions; the clouds have burst forth with rain.
O Nanak, the blessed soul-brides sleep in peace; they are in love with their Husband Lord. ||2||
Pauree:
He Himself has staged the tournament, and arranged the arena for the wrestlers.
They have entered the arena with pomp and ceremony; the Gurmukhs are joyful.
The false and foolish self-willed manmukhs are defeated and overcome.
The Lord Himself wrestles, and He Himself defeats them. He Himself staged this play.
The One God is the Lord and Master of all; this is known by the Gurmukhs.
He writes the inscription of His Hukam on the foreheads of all, without pen or ink.
In the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, Union with Him is obtained; there, the Glorious Praises of the Lord are chanted forever.
O Nanak, praising the True Word of His Shabad, one comes to realize the Truth. ||4||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Hanging low, low and thick in the sky, the clouds are changing color.
How do I know whether my love for my Husband Lord shall endure?
The love of those soul-brides endures, if their minds are filled with the Love and the Fear of God.
O Nanak, she who has no Love and Fear of God - her body shall never find peace. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Hanging low, low and thick in the sky, the clouds come, and pure water rains down.
O Nanak, that soul-bride suffers in pain, whose mind is torn away from her Husband Lord. ||2||
Pauree:
The One Lord created both sides and pervades the expanse.
The words of the Vedas became pervasive, with arguments and divisions.
Attachment and detachment are the two sides of it; Dharma, true religion, is the guide between the two.
The self-willed manmukhs are worthless and false. Without a doubt, they lose in the Court of the Lord.
Those who follow the Guru's Teachings are the true spiritual warriors; they have conquered sexual desire and anger.
They enter into the True Mansion of the Lord's Presence, embellished and exalted by the Word of the Shabad.
Those devotees are pleasing to Your Will, O Lord; they dearly love the True Name.
I am a sacrifice to those who serve their True Guru. ||5||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Hanging low, low and thick in the sky, the clouds come, and water rains down in torrents.
O Nanak, she walks in harmony with the Will of her Husband Lord; she enjoys peace and pleasure forever. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Why are you standing up, standing up to look? You poor wretch, this cloud has nothing in its hands.
The One who sent this cloud - cherish Him in your mind.
He alone enshrines the Lord in his mind, upon whom the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace.
O Nanak, all those who lack this Grace, cry and weep and wail. ||2||
Pauree:
Serve the Lord forever; He acts in no time at all.
He stretched the sky across the heavens; in an instant, He creates and destroys.
He Himself created the world; He contemplates His Creative Omnipotence.
The self-willed manmukh will be called to account hereafter; he will be severely punished.
