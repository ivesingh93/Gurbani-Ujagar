Meeting the True Guru, one is permeated forever with the Fear of God, who Himself comes to dwell within the mind. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, one who becomes Gurmukh and understands this is very rare.
To act without understanding is to lose the treasure of this human life. ||1||Pause||
Those who have tasted it, enjoy its flavor; without tasting it, they wander in doubt, lost and deceived.
The True Name is the Ambrosial Nectar; no one can describe it.
Drinking it in, one becomes honorable, absorbed in the Perfect Word of the Shabad. ||2||
He Himself gives, and then we receive. Nothing else can be done.
The Gift is in the Hands of the Great Giver. At the Guru's Door, in the Gurdwara, it is received.
Whatever He does, comes to pass. All act according to His Will. ||3||
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is abstinence, truthfulness, and self-restraint. Without the Name, no one becomes pure.
Through perfect good fortune, the Naam comes to abide within the mind. Through the Shabad, we merge into Him.
O Nanak, one who lives in intuitive peace and poise, imbued with the Lord's Love, obtains the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||4||17||50||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
You may torment your body with extremes of self-discipline, practice intensive meditation and hang upside-down, but your ego will not be eliminated from within.
You may perform religious rituals, and still never obtain the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, remain dead while yet alive, and the Name of the Lord shall come to dwell within the mind. ||1||
Listen, O my mind: hurry to the Protection of the Guru's Sanctuary.
By Guru's Grace you shall be saved. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, you shall cross over the terrifying world-ocean of poison. ||1||Pause||
Everything under the influence of the three qualities shall perish; the love of duality is corrupting.
The Pandits, the religious scholars, read the scriptures, but they are trapped in the bondage of emotional attachment. In love with evil, they do not understand.
Meeting the Guru, the bondage of the three qualities is cut away, and in the fourth state, the Door of Liberation is attained. ||2||
Through the Guru, the Path is found, and the darkness of emotional attachment is dispelled.
If one dies through the Shabad, then salvation is obtained, and one finds the Door of Liberation.
By Guru's Grace, one remains blended with the True Name of the Creator. ||3||
This mind is very powerful; we cannot escape it just by trying.
In the love of duality, people suffer in pain, condemned to terrible punishment.
O Nanak, those who are attached to the Naam are saved; through the Shabad, their ego is banished. ||4||18||51||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
By His Grace, the Guru is found, and the Name of the Lord is implanted within.
Without the Guru, no one has obtained it; they waste away their lives in vain.
The self-willed manmukhs create karma, and in the Court of the Lord, they receive their punishment. ||1||
O mind, give up the love of duality.
The Lord dwells within you; serving the Guru, you shall find peace. ||Pause||
When you love the Truth, your words are true; they reflect the True Word of the Shabad.
The Name of the Lord dwells within the mind; egotism and anger are wiped away.
Meditating on the Naam with a pure mind, the Door of Liberation is found. ||2||
Engrossed in egotism, the world perishes. It dies and is re-born; it continues coming and going in reincarnation.
The self-willed manmukhs do not recognize the Shabad; they forfeit their honor, and depart in disgrace.
Serving the Guru, the Name is obtained, and one remains absorbed in the True Lord. ||3||
