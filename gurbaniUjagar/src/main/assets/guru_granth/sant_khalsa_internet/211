The slaves of God are good.
O Nanak, their faces are radiant. ||4||3||141||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Hey, soul: your only Support is the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Whatever else you do or make happen, the fear of death still hangs over you. ||1||Pause||
He is not obtained by any other efforts.
By great good fortune, meditate on the Lord. ||1||
You may know hundreds of thousands of clever tricks,
but not even one will be of any use at all hereafter. ||2||
Good deeds done in the pride of ego,
are swept away, like the house of sand by water. ||3||
When God the Merciful shows His Mercy,
Nanak receives the Naam in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||4||4||142||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
I am a sacrifice, dedicated hundreds of thousands of times, to my Lord and Master.
His Name, and His Name alone, is the Support of the breath of life. ||1||Pause||
You alone are the Doer, the Cause of causes.
You are the Support of all beings and creatures. ||1||
O God, You are my power, authority and youth.
You are absolute, without attributes, and also related, with the most sublime attributes. ||2||
Here and hereafter, You are my Savior and Protector.
By Guru's Grace, some understand You. ||3||
God is All-knowing, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.
You are Nanak's strength and support. ||4||5||143||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Worship and adore the Lord, Har, Har, Har.
In the Society of the Saints, He dwells in the mind; doubt, emotional attachment and fear are vanquished. ||1||Pause||
The Vedas, the Puraanas and the Simritees are heard to proclaim
that the Lord's servant dwells as the highest of all. ||1||
All places are filled with fear - know this well.
Only the Lord's servants are free of fear. ||2||
People wander through 8.4 million incarnations.
God's people are not subject to birth and death. ||3||
Power, wisdom, cleverness and egotism are given up,
by Nanak as he has taken to the Sanctuary of the Lord's Holy Saints. ||4||6||144||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
O my mind, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord's Name.
Serve the Lord continually and continuously; with each and every breath, meditate on the Lord. ||1||Pause||
In the Society of the Saints, the Lord dwells in the mind,
and pain, suffering, darkness and doubt depart. ||1||
One who meditates on the Lord, by the Grace of the Saints,
that humble being is not afflicted with pain. ||2||
Those unto whom the Guru gives the Mantra of the Lord's Name,
are saved from the fire of Maya. ||3||
Be kind to Nanak, O God;
let the Lord's Name dwell within my mind and body. ||4||7||145||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
With your tongue, chant the Name of the One Lord.
In this world, it shall bring you peace, comfort and great joy; hereafter, it shall go with your soul, and shall be of use to you. ||1||Pause||
The disease of your ego shall be eradicated.
By Guru's Grace, practice Raja Yoga, the Yoga of meditation and success. ||1||
Those who taste the sublime essence of the Lord
have their thirst quenched. ||2||
Those who have found the Lord, the Treasure of peace,
shall not go anywhere else again. ||3||
Those, unto whom the Guru has given the Lord's Name, Har, Har -
O Nanak, their fears are removed. ||4||8||146||
