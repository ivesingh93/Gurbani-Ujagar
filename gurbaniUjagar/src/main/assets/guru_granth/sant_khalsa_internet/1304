Engrossed in unfulfilled sexual desire, unresolved anger and greed, you shall be consigned to reincarnation.
But I have entered the Sanctuary of the Purifier of sinners. O Nanak, I know that I shall be saved. ||2||12||31||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
I gaze on the Lotus-like Face of the Lord.
Searching and seeking, I have found the Jewel. I am totally rid of all anxiety. ||1||Pause||
Enshrining His Lotus Feet within my heart,
pain and wickedness have been dispelled. ||1||
The Lord of all the Universe is my kingdom, wealth and family.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, Nanak has earned the Profit; he shall never die again. ||2||13||32||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl, Fifth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Worship God, and adore His Name.
Grasp the Feet of the Guru, the True Guru.
The Unfathomable Lord shall come into your mind,
and by Guru's Grace, you shall be victorious in this world. ||1||Pause||
I have studied countless ways of worship in all sorts of ways, but that alone is worship, which is pleasing to the Lord's Will.
This body-puppet is made of clay - what can it do by itself?
O God, those humble beings meet You, whom You grasp by the arm, and place on the Path. ||1||
I do not know of any other support; O Lord, You are my only Hope and Support.
I am meek and poor - what prayer can I offer?
God abides in every heart.
My mind is thirsty for the Feet of God.
Servant Nanak, Your slave, speaks: I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, forever a sacrifice to You. ||2||1||33||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl, Sixth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Your Name, O my Beloved, is the Saving Grace of the world.
The Lord's Name is the wealth of the nine treasures.
One who is imbued with the Love of the Incomparably Beautiful Lord is joyful.
O mind, why do you cling to emotional attachments?
With your eyes, gaze upon the Blessed Vision, the Darshan of the Holy.
They alone find it, who have such destiny inscribed upon their foreheads. ||1||Pause||
I serve at the feet of the Holy Saints.
I long for the dust of their feet, which purifies and sanctifies.
Just like the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage, it washes away filth and pollution.
With each and every breath I meditate on Him, and never turn my face away.
Of your thousands and millions, nothing shall go along with you.
Only the Name of God will call to you in the end. ||1||
Let it be your wish to honor and obey the One Formless Lord.
Abandon the love of everything else.
What Glorious Praises of Yours can I utter, O my Beloved?
I cannot describe even one of Your Virtues.
My mind is so thirsty for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan.
Please come and meet Nanak, O Divine Guru of the World. ||2||1||34||
