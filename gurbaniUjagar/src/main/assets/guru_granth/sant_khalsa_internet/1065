I am a sacrifice to those who remember the Lord.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I unite in Union with the Lord.
I touch the dust of their feet to my face and forehead; sitting in the Society of the Saints, I sing His Glorious Praises. ||2||
I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, as I am pleasing to the Lord God.
With the Lord's Name deep within my inner being, I am adorned with the Word of the Shabad.
The Word of the Guru's Bani is heard throughout the four corners of the world; through it, we merge in the True Name. ||3||
That humble being is pure, who searches within himself,
through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, sees the Lord with his eyes.
Through the Guru's Shabad, he applies the ointment of spiritual wisdom to his eyes; the Gracious Lord, in His Grace, unites him with Himself. ||4||
By great good fortune, I obtained this body;
in this human life, I have focused my consciousness on the Word of the Shabad.
Without the Shabad, everything is enveloped in utter darkness; only the Gurmukh understands. ||5||
Some merely waste away their lives - why have they even come into the world?
The self-willed manmukhs are attached to the love of duality.
This opportunity shall not into their hands again; their foot slips, and they come to regret and repent. ||6||
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the body is sanctified.
The True Lord, the ocean of virtue, dwells within it.
One who sees the Truest of the True everywhere, hears the Truth, and enshrines it within his mind. ||7||
Egotism and mental calculations are relieved through the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Keep the Dear Lord close, and enshrine Him in your heart.
One who praises the Lord forever, through the Guru's Shabad, meets with the True Lord, and finds peace. ||8||
He alone remembers the Lord, whom the Lord inspires to remember.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, He comes to dwell in the mind.
He Himself sees, and He Himself understands; He merges all into Himself. ||9||
He alone knows, who has placed the object within his mind.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he comes to understand himself.
That humble being who understands himself is immaculate. He proclaims the Guru's Bani, and the Word of the Shabad. ||10||
This body is sanctified and purified;
through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, it contemplates the Lord, the ocean of virtue.
One who chants the Glorious Praises of the Lord night and day, and remains attuned to His Love, chants His Glorious Virtues, immersed in the Glorious Lord. ||11||
This body is the source of all Maya;
in love with duality, it is deluded by doubt.
It does not remember the Lord, and suffers in eternal pain. Without remembering the Lord, it suffers in pain. ||12||
One who serves the True Guru is approved and respected.
His body and soul-swan are immaculate and pure; in the Court of the Lord, he is known to be true.
He serves the Lord, and enshrines the Lord in his mind; he is exalted, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||13||
Without good destiny, no one can serve the True Guru.
The self-willed manmukhs are deluded, and dIE weeping and wailing.
Those who are blessed by the Guru's Glance of Grace - the Dear Lord unites them with Himself. ||14||
In the body fortress, are the solidly-constructed markets.
The Gurmukh purchases the object, and takes care of it.
Meditating on the Name of the Lord, day and night, he attains the sublime, exalted status. ||15||
The True Lord Himself is the Giver of peace.
Through the Shabad of the Perfect Guru, He is realized.
Nanak praises the Naam, the True Name of the Lord; through perfect destiny, He is found. ||16||7||21||
