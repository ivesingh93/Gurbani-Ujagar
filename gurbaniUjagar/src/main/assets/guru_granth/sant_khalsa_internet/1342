Prabhaatee, Ashtapadees, First Mehl, Bibhaas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The insanity of duality has driven the mind insane.
In false greed, life is wasting away.
Duality clings to the mind; it cannot be restrained.
The True Guru saves us, implanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord within. ||1||
Without subduing the mind, Maya cannot be subdued.
The One who created this, He alone understands. Contemplating the Word of the Shabad, one is carried across the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||Pause||
Gathering the wealth of Maya, kings become proud and arrogant.
But this Maya that they love so much shall not go along with them in the end.
There are so many colors and flavors of attachment to Maya.
Except for the Name, no one has any friend or companion. ||2||
According to one's own mind, one sees the minds of others.
According to one's desires, one's condition is determined.
According to one's actions, one is focused and tuned in.
Seeking the advice of the True Guru, one finds the home of peace and poise. ||3||
In music and song, the mind is caught by the love of duality.
Filled with deception deep within, one suffers in terrible pain.
Meeting with the True Guru, one is blessed with clear understanding,
and remains lovingly attuned to the True Name. ||4||
Through the True Word of the Shabad, one practices Truth.
He sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, through the True Word of His Bani.
He dwells in the home of his own heart deep within, and obtains the immortal status.
Then, he is blessed with honor in the Court of the True Lord. ||5||
Without serving the Guru, there is no devotional worship,
even though one may make all sorts of efforts.
If one eradicates egotism and selfishness through the Shabad,
the Immaculate Naam comes to abide in the mind. ||6||
In this world, the practice of the Shabad is the most excellent occupation.
Without the Shabad, everything else is the darkness of emotional attachment.
Through the Shabad, the Naam is enshrined within the heart.
Through the Shabad, one obtains clear understanding and the door of salvation. ||7||
There is no other Creator except the All-seeing Lord God.
The True Lord Himself is Infinite and Incomparably Beautiful.
Through the Lord's Name, one obtains the most sublime and exalted state.
O Nanak, how rare are those humble beings, who seek and find the Lord. ||8||1||
Prabhaatee, First Mehl:
Emotional attachment to Maya is spread out all over the world.
Seeing a beautiful woman, the man is overcome with sexual desire.
His love for his children and gold steadily increases.
He sees everything as his own, but he does not own the One Lord. ||1||
I meditate as I chant on such a mala,
that I rise above pleasure and pain; I attain the most wondrous devotional worship of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
O Treasure of Virtue, Your limits cannot be found.
Through the True Word of the Shabad, I am absorbed into You.
You Yourself created the comings and goings of reincarnation.
They alone are devotees, who focus their consciousness on You. ||2||
Spiritual wisdom and meditation on the Lord, the Lord of Nirvaanaa
- without meeting the True Guru, no one knows this.
The Lord's Light fills the sacred pools of all beings.
I am a sacrifice to the Embodiment of Bliss. ||3||
Through the Guru's Teachings, one achieves loving devotional worship.
The Shabad burns away egotism from within.
