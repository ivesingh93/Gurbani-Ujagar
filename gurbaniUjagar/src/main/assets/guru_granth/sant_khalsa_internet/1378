I am so accustomed to walking in the ways of the world. I have tied and picked up the bundle; where can I go to throw it away? ||2||
I know nothing; I understand nothing. The world is a smoldering fire.
My Lord did well to warn me about it; otherwise, I would have been burnt as well. ||3||
Fareed, if I had known that I had so few sesame seeds, I would have been more careful with them in my hands.
If I had known that my Husband Lord was so young and innocent, I would not have been so arrogant. ||4||
If I had known that my robe would come loose, I would have tied a tighter knot.
I have found none as great as You, Lord; I have looked and searched throughout the world. ||5||
Fareed, if you have a keen understanding, then do not write black marks against anyone else.
Look underneath your own collar instead. ||6||
Fareed, do not turn around and strike those who strike you with their fists.
Kiss their feet, and return to your own home. ||7||
Fareed, when there was time for you to earn good karma, you were in love with the world instead.
Now, death has a strong foothold; when the load is full, it is taken away. ||8||
See, Fareed, what has happened: your beard has become grey.
That which is coming is near, and the past is left far behind. ||9||
See, Fareed, what has happened: sugar has become poison.
Without my Lord, who can I tell of my sorrow? ||10||
Fareed, my eyes have become weak, and my ears have become hard of hearing.
The body's crop has become ripe and turned color. ||11||
Fareed, those who did not enjoy their Spouse when their hair was black - hardly any of them enjoy Him when their hair turns grey.
So be in love with the Lord, so that your color may ever be new. ||12||
Third Mehl:
Fareed, whether one's hair is black or grey, our Lord and Master is always here if one remembers Him.
This loving devotion to the Lord does not come by one's own efforts, even though all may long for it.
This cup of loving devotion belongs to our Lord and Master; He gives it to whomever He likes. ||13||
Fareed, those eyes which have enticed the world - I have seen those eyes.
Once, they could not endure even a bit of mascara; now, the birds hatch their young in them! ||14||
Fareed, they shouted and yelled, and constantly gave good advice.
But those whom the devil has spoiled - how can they turn their consciousness towards God? ||15||
Fareed, become the grass on the path,
if you long for the Lord of all.
One will cut you down, and another will trample you underfoot;
then, you shall enter the Court of the Lord. ||16||
Fareed, do not slander the dust; noting is as great as dust.
When we are alive, it is under our feet, and when we are dead, it is above us. ||17||
Fareed, when there is greed, what love can there be? When there is greed, love is false.
How long can one remain in a thatched hut which leaks when it rains? ||18||
Fareed, why do you wander from jungle to jungle, crashing through the thorny trees?
The Lord abides in the heart; why are you looking for Him in the jungle? ||19||
Fareed, with these small legs, I crossed deserts and mountains.
But today, Fareed, my water jug seems hundreds of miles away. ||20||
Fareed, the nights are long, and my sides are aching in pain.
