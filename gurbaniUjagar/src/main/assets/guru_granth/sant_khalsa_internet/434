He made all beings and creatures his chessmen, and He Himself threw the dice. ||26||
Bhabha: Those who search, find the fruits of their rewards; by Guru's Grace, they live in the Fear of God.

As long as the body is alive, he reads other things, and forgets the letter 'm', which stands for marnaa - death. ||28||
Yaya: He is never reincarnated again, if he recognizes the True Lord.

Meditate on the Lord's Name, be absorbed into the Lord's Name, and night and day, reap the Profit of the Lord's Name. ||34||
