One who has the Lord as his Master, O Siblings of Destiny -
countless liberations knock at his door. ||1||
If I say now that my trust is in You alone, Lord,
then what obligation do I have to anyone else? ||1||Pause||
He bears the burden of the three worlds;
why should He not cherish you also? ||2||
Says Kabeer, through contemplation, I have obtained this one understanding.
If the mother poisons her own child, what can anyone do? ||3||22||
Gauree, Kabeer Jee:
Without Truth, how can the woman be a true satee - a widow who burns herself on her husband's funeral pyre?
O Pandit, O religious scholar, see this and contemplate it within your heart. ||1||
Without love, how can one's affection increase?
As long as there is attachment to pleasure, there can be no spiritual love. ||1||Pause||
One who, in his own soul, believes the Queen Maya to be true,
does not meet the Lord, even in dreams. ||2||
One who surrenders her body, mind, wealth, home and self -
she is the true soul-bride, says Kabeer. ||3||23||
Gauree, Kabeer Jee:
The whole world is engrossed in corruption.
This corruption has drowned entire families. ||1||
O man, why have you wrecked your boat and sunk it?
You have broken with the Lord, and joined hands with corruption. ||1||Pause||
Angels and human beings alike are burning in the raging fire.
The water is near at hand, but the beast does not drink it in. ||2||
By constant contemplation and awareness, the water is brought forth.
That water is immaculate and pure, says Kabeer. ||3||24||
Gauree, Kabeer Jee:
That family, whose son has no spiritual wisdom or contemplation -
why didn't his mother just become a widow? ||1||
That man who has not practiced devotional worship of the Lord -
why didn't such a sinful man dIE at birth? ||1||Pause||
So many pregnancies end in miscarriage - why was this one spared?
He lives his life in this world like a deformed amputee. ||2||
Says Kabeer, beautiful and handsome people,
are just ugly hunch-backs without the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||3||25||
Gauree, Kabeer Jee:
To those humble beings who take the Name of their Lord and Master,
I am forever a sacrifice to them. ||1||
Those who sing the Glorious Praises of the Pure Lord are pure.
They are my Siblings of Destiny, so dear to my heart. ||1||Pause||
Whose hearts are filled with the All-pervading Lord,
I am the dust of the lotus feet of those. ||2||
I am a weaver by birth, and patient of mind.
Slowly, steadily, Kabeer chants the Glories of God. ||3||26||
Gauree, Kabeer Jee:
From the Sky of the Tenth Gate, the nectar trickles down, distilled from my furnace.
I have gathered in this most sublime essence, making my body into firewood. ||1||
He alone is called intoxicated with intuitive peace and poise,
who drinks in the juice of the Lord's essence, contemplating spiritual wisdom. ||1||Pause||
Intuitive poise is the bar-maid who comes to serve it.
I pass my nights and days in ecstasy. ||2||
Through conscious meditation, I linked my consciousness with the Immaculate Lord.
Says Kabeer, then I obtained the Fearless Lord. ||3||27||
Gauree, Kabeer Jee:
The natural tendency of the mind is to chase the mind.
Who has established himself as a Siddha, a being of miraculous spiritual powers, by killing his mind? ||1||
