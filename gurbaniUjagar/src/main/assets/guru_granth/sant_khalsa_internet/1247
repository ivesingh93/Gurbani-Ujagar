Pauree:
The fortress of the body has been decorated and adorned in so many ways.
The wealthy wear beautiful silk robes of various colors.
They hold elegant and beautiful courts, on red and white carpets.
But they eat in pain, and in pain they seek pleasure; they are very proud of their pride.
O Nanak, the mortal does not even think of the Name, which shall deliver him in the end. ||24||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
She sleeps in intuitive peace and poise, absorbed in the Word of the Shabad.
God hugs her close in His Embrace, and merges her into Himself.
Duality is eradicated with intuitive ease.
The Naam comes to abide in her mind.
He hugs close in His Embrace those who shatter and reform their beings.
O Nanak, those who are predestined to meet Him, come and meet Him now. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Those who forget the Naam, the Name of the Lord - so what if they chant other chants?
They are maggots in manure, plundered by the thief of worldly entanglements.
O Nanak, never forget the Naam; greed for anything else is false. ||2||
Pauree:
Those who praise the Naam, and believe in the Naam, are eternally stable in this world.
Within their hearts, they dwell on the Lord, and nothing else at all.
With each and every hair, they chant the Lord's Name, each and every instant, the Lord.
The birth of the Gurmukh is fruitful and certified; pure and unstained, his filth is washed away.
O Nanak, meditating on the Lord of eternal life, the status of immortality is obtained. ||25||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Those who forget the Naam and do other things,
O Nanak, will be bound and gagged and beaten in the City of Death, like the thief caught red-handed. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
The earth is beauteous, and the sky is lovely, chanting the Name of the Lord.
O Nanak, those who lack the Naam - their carcasses are eaten by the crows. ||2||
Pauree:
Those who lovingly praise the Naam, and dwell in the mansion of the self deep within,
do not enter into reincarnation ever again; they shall never be destroyed.
They remain immersed and absorbed in the love of the Lord, with every breath and morsel of food.
The color of the Lord's Love never fades away; the Gurmukhs are enlightened.
Granting His Grace, He unites them with Himself; O Nanak, the Lord keeps them by His side. ||26||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
As long as his mind is disturbed by waves, he is caught in ego and egotistical pride.
He does not find the taste of the Shabad, and he does not embrace love for the Name.
His service is not accepted; worrying and worrying, he wastes away in misery.
O Nanak, he alone is called a selfless servant, who cuts off his head, and offers it to the Lord.
He accepts the Will of the True Guru, and enshrines the Shabad within his heart. ||1||
Third Mehl:
That is chanting and meditation, work and selfless service, which is pleasing to our Lord and Master.
The Lord Himself forgives, and takes away self-conceit, and unites the mortals with Himself.
United with the Lord, the mortal is never separated again; his light merges into the Light.
O Nanak, by Guru's Grace, the mortal understands, when the Lord allows him to understand. ||2||
Pauree:
All are held accountable, even the egotistical self-willed manmukhs.
They never even think of the Name of the Lord; the Messenger of Death shall hit them on their heads.
