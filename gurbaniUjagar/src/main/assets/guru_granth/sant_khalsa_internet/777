My mind and body long to behold the Guru's face. O Sovereign Lord, I have spread out my bed of loving faith.
O servant Nanak, when the bride pleases her Lord God, her Sovereign Lord meets her with natural ease. ||3||
My Lord God, my Sovereign Lord, is on the one bed. The Guru has shown me how to meet my Lord.
My mind and body are filled with love and affection for my Sovereign Lord. In His Mercy, the Guru has united me with Him.
I am a sacrifice to my Guru, O my Sovereign Lord; I surrender my soul to the True Guru.
When the Guru is totally pleased, O servant Nanak, he unites the soul with the Lord, the Sovereign Lord. ||4||2||6||5||7||6||18||
Raag Soohee, Chhant, Fifth Mehl, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Listen, madman: gazing upon the world, why have you gone crazy?
Listen, madman: you have been trapped by false love, which is transitory, like the fading color of the safflower.
Gazing upon the false world, you are fooled. It is not worth even half a shell. Only the Name of the Lord of the Universe is permanent.
You shall take on the deep and lasting red color of the poppy, contemplating the sweet Word of the Guru's Shabad.
You remain intoxicated with false emotional attachment; you are attached to falsehood.
Nanak, meek and humble, seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord, the treasure of mercy. He preserves the honor of His devotees. ||1||
Listen, madman: serve your Lord, the Master of the breath of life.
Listen, madman: whoever comes, shall go.
Listen, O wandering stranger: that which you believe to be permanent, shall all pass away; so remain in the Saints' Congregation.
Listen, renunciate: by your good destiny, obtain the Lord, and remain attached to God's Feet.
Dedicate and surrender this mind to the Lord, and have no doubts; as Gurmukh, renounce your great pride.
O Nanak, the Lord carries the meek and humble devotees across the terrifying world-ocean. What Glorious Virtues of Your should I chant and recite? ||2||
Listen, madman: why do you harbor false pride?
Listen, madman: all your egotism and pride shall be overcome.
What you think is permanent, shall all pass away. Pride is false, so become the slave of God's Saints.
Remain dead while still alive, and you shall cross over the terrifying world-ocean, if it is your pre-ordained destiny.
One whom the Lord causes to meditate intuitively, serves the Guru, and drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar.
Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord's Door; I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, forever a sacrifice to Him. ||3||
Listen, madman: do not think that you have found God.
Listen, madman: be the dust under the feet of those who meditate on God.
Those who meditate on God find peace. By great good fortune, the Blessed Vision of their Darshan is obtained.
Be humble, and be forever a sacrifice, and your self-conceit shall be totally eradicated.
One who has found God is pure, with blessed destiny. I would sell myself to him.
Nanak, the meek and humble, seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord, the ocean of peace. Make him Your own, and preserve his honor. ||4||1||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
The True Guru was satisfied with me, and blessed me with the Support of the Lord's Lotus Feet. I am a sacrifice to the Lord.
