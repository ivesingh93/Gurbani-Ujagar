One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Vaar Of Siree Raag, Fourth Mehl, With Shaloks:
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Among the ragas, Siree Raag is the best, if it inspires you to enshrine love for the True Lord.
The True Lord comes to abide forever in the mind, and your understanding becomes steady and unequalled.
The priceless jewel is obtained, by contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
The tongue becomes true, the mind becomes true, and the body becomes true as well.
O Nanak, forever true are the dealings of those who serve the True Guru. ||1||
Third Mehl:
All other loves are transitory, as long as people do not love their Lord and Master.
This mind is enticed by Maya-it cannot see or hear.
Without seeing her Husband Lord, love does not well up; what can the blind person do?
O Nanak, the True One who takes away the eyes of spiritual wisdom-He alone can restore them. ||2||
Pauree:
The Lord alone is the One Creator; there is only the One Court of the Lord.
The One Lord's Command is the One and Only-enshrine the One Lord in your consciousness.
Without that Lord, there is no other at all. Remove your fear, doubt and dread.
Praise that Lord who protects you, inside your home, and outside as well.
When that Lord becomes merciful, and one comes to chant the Lord's Name, one swims across the ocean of fear. ||1||
Shalok, First Mehl:
The gifts belong to our Lord and Master; how can we compete with Him?
Some remain awake and aware, and do not receive these gifts, while others are awakened from their sleep to be blessed. ||1||
First Mehl:
Faith, contentment and tolerance are the food and provisions of the angels.
They obtain the Perfect Vision of the Lord, while those who gossip find no place of rest. ||2||
Pauree:
You Yourself created all; You Yourself delegate the tasks.
You Yourself are pleased, beholding Your Own Glorious Greatness.
O Lord, there is nothing at all beyond You. You are the True Lord.
You Yourself are contained in all places.
Meditate on that Lord, O Saints; He shall rescue and save you. ||2||
Shalok, First Mehl:
Pride in social status is empty; pride in personal glory is useless.
The One Lord gives shade to all beings.
You may call yourself good;
O Nanak, this will only be known when your honor is approved in God's Account. ||1||
Second Mehl:
Die before the one whom you love;
to live after he dies is to live a worthless life in this world. ||2||
Pauree:
You Yourself created the earth, and the two lamps of the sun and the moon.
You created the fourteen world-shops, in which Your Business is transacted.
The Lord bestows His Profits on those who become Gurmukh.
The Messenger of Death does not touch those who drink in the True Ambrosial Nectar.
They themselves are saved, along with their family, and all those who follow them are saved as well. ||3||
Shalok, First Mehl:
He created the Creative Power of the Universe, within which He dwells.
