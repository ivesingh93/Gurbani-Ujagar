In this world, you shall not find any shelter; in the world hereafter, being false, you shall suffer. ||1||Pause||
The True Lord Himself knows all; He makes no mistakes. He is the Great Farmer of the Universe.
First, He prepares the ground, and then He plants the Seed of the True Name.
The nine treasures are produced from Name of the One Lord. By His Grace, we obtain His Banner and Insignia. ||2||
Some are very knowledgeable, but if they do not know the Guru, then what is the use of their lives?
The blind have forgotten the Naam, the Name of the Lord. The self-willed manmukhs are in utter darkness.
Their comings and goings in reincarnation do not end; through death and rebirth, they are wasting away. ||3||
The bride may buy sandalwood oil and perfumes, and apply them in great quantities to her hair;
she may sweeten her breath with betel leaf and camphor,
but if this bride is not pleasing to her Husband Lord, then all these trappings are false. ||4||
Her enjoyment of all pleasures is futile, and all her decorations are corrupt.
Until she has been pierced through with the Shabad, how can she look beautiful at Guru's Gate?
O Nanak, blessed is that fortunate bride, who is in love with her Husband Lord. ||5||13||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
The empty body is dreadful, when the soul goes out from within.
The burning fire of life is extinguished, and the smoke of the breath no longer emerges.
The five relatives (the senses) weep and wail painfully, and waste away through the love of duality. ||1||
You fool: chant the Name of the Lord, and preserve your virtue.
Egotism and possessiveness are very enticing; egotistical pride has plundered everyone. ||1||Pause||
Those who have forgotten the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are attached to affairs of duality.
Attached to duality, they putrefy and die; they are filled with the fire of desire within.
Those who are protected by the Guru are saved; all others are cheated and plundered by deceitful worldly affairs. ||2||
Love dies, and affection vanishes. Hatred and alienation die.
Entanglements end, and egotism dies, along with attachment to Maya, possessiveness and anger.
Those who receive His Mercy obtain the True One. The Gurmukhs dwell forever in balanced restraint. ||3||
By true actions, the True Lord is met, and the Guru's Teachings are found.
Then, they are not subject to birth and death; they do not come and go in reincarnation.
O Nanak, they are respected at the Lord's Gate; they are robed in honor in the Court of the Lord. ||4||14||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
The body is burnt to ashes; by its love of Maya, the mind is rusted through.
Demerits become one's enemies, and falsehood blows the bugle of attack.
Without the Word of the Shabad, people wander lost in reincarnation. Through the love of duality, multitudes have been drowned. ||1||
O mind, swim across, by focusing your consciousness on the Shabad.
Those who do not become Gurmukh do not understand the Naam; they die, and continue coming and going in reincarnation. ||1||Pause||
That body is said to be pure, in which the True Name abides.
One whose body is imbued with the Fear of the True One, and whose tongue savors Truthfulness,
is brought to ecstasy by the True Lord's Glance of Grace. That person does not have to go through the fire of the womb again. ||2||
From the True Lord came the air, and from the air came water.
From water, He created the three worlds; in each and every heart He has infused His Light.
The Immaculate Lord does not become polluted. Attuned to the Shabad, honor is obtained. ||3||
One whose mind is contented with Truthfulness, is blessed with the Lord's Glance of Grace.
