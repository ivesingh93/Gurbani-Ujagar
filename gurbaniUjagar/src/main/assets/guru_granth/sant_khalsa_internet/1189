That humble being who is imbued with the sublime essence of the Lord is certified and approved. ||7||
I see Him here and there; I dwell on Him intuitively.
I do not love any other than You, O Lord and Master.
O Nanak, my ego has been burnt away by the Word of the Shabad.
The True Guru has shown me the Blessed Vision of the True Lord. ||8||3||
Basant, First Mehl:
The fickle consciousness cannot find the Lord's limits.
It is caught in non-stop coming and going.
I am suffering and dying, O my Creator.
No one cares for me, except my Beloved. ||1||
All are high and exalted; how can I call anyone low?
Devotional worship of the Lord and the True Name has satisfied me. ||1||Pause||
I have taken all sorts of medicines; I am so tired of them.
How can this disease be cured, without my Guru?
Without devotional worship of the Lord, the pain is so great.
My Lord and Master is the Giver of pain and pleasure. ||2||
The disease is so deadly; how can I find the courage?
He knows my disease, and only He can take away the pain.
My mind and body are filled with faults and demerits.
I searched and searched, and found the Guru, O my brother! ||3||
The Word of the Guru's Shabad, and the Lord's Name are the cures.
As You keep me, so do I remain.
The world is sick; where should I look?
The Lord is Pure and Immaculate; Immaculate is His Name. ||4||
The Guru sees and reveals the Lord's home, deep within the home of the self;
He ushers the soul-bride into the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.
When the mind remains in the mind, and the consciousness in the consciousness,
such people of the Lord remain unattached. ||5||
They remain free of any desire for happiness or sorrow;
tasting the Amrit, the Ambrosial Nectar, they abide in the Lord's Name.
They recognize their own selves, and remain lovingly attuned to the Lord.
They are victorious on the battlefield of life, following the Guru's Teachings, and their pains run away. ||6||
The Guru has given me the True Ambrosial Nectar; I drink it in.
Of course, I have died, and now I am alive to live.
Please, protect me as Your Own, if it pleases You.
One who is Yours, merges into You. ||7||
Painful diseases afflict those who are sexually promiscuous.
God appears permeating and pervading in each and every heart.
One who remains unattached, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad-
O Nanak, his heart and consciousness dwell upon and savor the Lord. ||8||4||
Basant, First Mehl, Ik-Tukee:
Do not make such a show of rubbing ashes on your body.
O naked Yogi, this is not the way of Yoga! ||1||
You fool! How can you have forgotten the Lord's Name?
At the very last moment, it and it alone shall be of any use to you. ||1||Pause||
Consult the Guru, reflect and think it over.
Wherever I look, I see the Lord of the World. ||2||
What can I say? I am nothing.
All my status and honor are in Your Name. ||3||
Why do you take such pride in gazing upon your property and wealth?
When you must leave, nothing shall go along with you. ||4||
So subdue the five thieves, and hold your consciousness in its place.
This is the basis of the way of Yoga. ||5||
Your mind is tied with the rope of egotism.
You do not even think of the Lord - you fool! He alone shall liberate you. ||6||
If you forget the Lord, you will fall into the clutches of the Messenger of Death.
At that very last moment, you fool, you shall be beaten. ||7||
