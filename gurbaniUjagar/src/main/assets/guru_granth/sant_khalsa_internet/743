Grasping the Lord's Feet, O Nanak, we enter His Sanctuary. ||4||22||28||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
One who withdraws from God's Path, and attaches himself to the world,
is known as a sinner in both worlds. ||1||
He alone is approved, who pleases the Lord.
Only He Himself knows His creative omnipotence. ||1||Pause||
One who practices truth, righteous living, charity and good deeds,
has the supplies for God's Path. Worldly success shall not fail him. ||2||
Within and among all, the One Lord is awake.
As He attaches us, so are we attached. ||3||
You are inaccessible and unfathomable, O my True Lord and Master.
Nanak speaks as You inspire him to speak. ||4||23||29||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
In the early hours of the morning, I chant the Lord's Name.
I have fashioned a shelter for myself, hear and hereafter. ||1||
Forever and ever, I chant the Lord's Name,
and the desires of my mind are fulfilled. ||1||Pause||
Sing the Praises of the Eternal, Imperishable Lord God, night and day.
In life, and in death, you shall find your eternal, unchanging home. ||2||
So serve the Sovereign Lord, and you shall never lack anything.
While eating and consuming, you shall pass your life in peace. ||3||
O Life of the World, O Primal Being, I have found the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
By Guru's Grace, O Nanak, I meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||24||30||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
When the Perfect Guru becomes merciful,
my pains are taken away, and my works are perfectly completed. ||1||
Gazing upon, beholding the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, I live;
I am a sacrifice to Your Lotus Feet.
Without You, O my Lord and Master, who belongs to me? ||1||Pause||
I have fallen in love with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy,
by the karma of my past actions and my pre-ordained destiny. ||2||
Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; how wondrous is His glory!
The three types of illness cannot consume it. ||3||
May I never forget, even for an instant, the Lord's Feet.
Nanak begs for this gift, O my Beloved. ||4||25||31||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
May there be such an auspicious time, O my Beloved,
when, with my tongue, I may chant the Lord's Name||1||
Hear my prayer, O God, O Merciful to the meek.
The Holy Saints ever sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, the Source of Nectar. ||1||Pause||
Your meditation and remembrance is life-giving, God.
You dwell near those upon whom You show mercy. ||2||
Your Name is the food to satisfy the hunger of Your humble servants.
You are the Great Giver, O Lord God. ||3||
The Saints take pleasure in repeating the Lord's Name.
O Nanak, the Lord, the Great Giver, is All-knowing. ||4||26||32||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
Your life is slipping away, but you never even notice.
You are constantly entangled in false attachments and conflicts. ||1||
Meditate, vibrate constantly, day and night, on the Lord.
You shall be victorious in this priceless human life, in the Protection of the Lord's Sanctuary. ||1||Pause||
You eagerly commit sins and practice corruption,
but you do not enshrine the jewel of the Lord's Name within your heart, even for an instant. ||2||
Feeding and pampering your body, your life is passing away,
