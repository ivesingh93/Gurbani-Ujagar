Blessed, blessed are the humble servants of the Lord, who know the Lord God.
I go and ask those humble servants about the Mysteries of the Lord.
I wash and massage their feet; joining with the humble servants of the Lord, I drink in the Sublime Essence of the Lord. ||2||
The True Guru, the Giver, has implanted the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within me.
By great good fortune, I have obtained the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan.
The True Essence is Ambrosial Nectar; through the Ambrosial Words of the Perfect Guru, this Amrit is obtained. ||3||
O Lord, lead me to the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, and the true beings.
Joining the Sat Sangat, I meditate on the Lord's Name.
O Nanak, I listen and chant the Lord's Sermon; through the Guru's Teachings, I am fulfilled by the Name of the Lord. ||4||6||
Maajh, Fourth Mehl:
Come, dear sisters-let us join together.
I am a sacrifice to the one who tells me of my Beloved.
Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, I have found the Lord, my Best Friend. I am a sacrifice to the True Guru. ||1||
Wherever I look, there I see my Lord and Master.
You are permeating each and every heart, O Lord, Inner-knower, Searcher of Hearts.
The Perfect Guru has shown me that the Lord is always with me. I am forever a sacrifice to the True Guru. ||2||
There is only one breath; all are made of the same clay; the light within all is the same.
The One Light pervades all the many and various beings. This Light intermingles with them, but it is not diluted or obscured.
By Guru's Grace, I have come to see the One. I am a sacrifice to the True Guru. ||3||
Servant Nanak speaks the Ambrosial Bani of the Word.
It is dear and pleasing to the minds of the GurSikhs.
The Guru, the Perfect True Guru, shares the Teachings. The Guru, the True Guru, is Generous to all. ||4||7||
Seven Chau-Padas Of The Fourth Mehl. ||
Maajh, Fifth Mehl, Chau-Padas, First House:
My mind longs for the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan.
It cries out like the thirsty song-bird.
My thirst is not quenched, and I can find no peace, without the Blessed Vision of the Beloved Saint. ||1||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to the Blessed Vision of the Beloved Saint Guru. ||1||Pause||
Your Face is so Beautiful, and the Sound of Your Words imparts intuitive wisdom.
It is so long since this rain-bird has had even a glimpse of water.
Blessed is that land where You dwell, O my Friend and Intimate Divine Guru. ||2||
I am a sacrifice, I am forever a sacrifice, to my Friend and Intimate Divine Guru. ||1||Pause||
When I could not be with You for just one moment, the Dark Age of Kali Yuga dawned for me.
When will I meet You, O my Beloved Lord?
