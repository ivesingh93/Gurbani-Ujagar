Your body shall not suffer from any disease, and you shall obtain everything. ||78||
Fareed, the bird is a guest in this beautiful world-garden.
The morning drums are beating - get ready to leave! ||79||
Fareed, musk is released at night. Those who are sleeping do not receive their share.
Those whose eyes are heavy with sleep - how can they receive it? ||80||
Fareed, I thought that I was in trouble; the whole world is in trouble!
When I climbed the hill and looked around, I saw this fire in each and every home. ||81||
Fifth Mehl:
Fareed, in the midst of this beautiful earth, there is a garden of thorns.
Those humble beings who are blessed by their spiritual teacher, do not suffer even a scratch. ||82||
Fifth Mehl:
Fareed, life is blessed and beautiful, along with the beautiful body.
Only a rare few are found, who love their Beloved Lord. ||83||
O river, do not destroy your banks; you too will be asked to give your account.
The river flows in whatever direction the Lord orders. ||84||
Fareed, the day passes painfully; the night is spent in anguish.
The boatman stands up and shouts, "The boat is caught in the whirlpool!" ||85||
The river flows on and on; it loves to eat into its banks.
What can the whirlpool do to the boat, if the boatman remains alert? ||86||
Fareed, there are dozens who say they are friends; I search, but I cannot find even one.
I yearn for my beloved like a smoldering fire. ||87||
Fareed, this body is always barking. Who can stand this constant suffering?
I have put plugs in my ears; I don't care how much the wind is blowing. ||88||
Fareed, God's dates have ripened, and rivers of honey flow.
With each passing day, your life is being stolen away. ||89||
Fareed, my withered body has become a skeleton; the crows are pecking at my palms.
Even now, God has not come to help me; behold, this is the fate of all mortal beings. ||90||
The crows have searched my skeleton, and eaten all my flesh.
But please do not touch these eyes; I hope to see my Lord. ||91||
O crow, do not peck at my skeleton; if you have landed on it, fly away.
Do not eat the flesh from that skeleton, within which my Husband Lord abides. ||92||
Fareed, the poor grave calls out, "O homeless one, come back to your home.
You shall surely have to come to me; do not be afraid of death". ||93||
These eyes have seen a great many leave.
Fareed, the people have their fate, and I have mine. ||94||
God says, "If you reform yourself, you shall meet me, and meeting me, you shall be at peace.
O Fareed, if you will be mine, the whole world will be yours". ||95||
How long can the tree remain implanted on the river-bank?
Fareed, how long can water be kept in a soft clay pot? ||96||
Fareed, the mansions are vacant; those who lived in them have gone to live underground.
