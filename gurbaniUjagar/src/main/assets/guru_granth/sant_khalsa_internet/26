All the world continues coming and going in reincarnation. ||3||
In the midst of this world, do seva,
and you shall be given a place of honor in the Court of the Lord.
Says Nanak, swing your arms in joy! ||4||33||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
I serve my True Guru with single-minded devotion, and lovingly focus my consciousness on Him.
The True Guru is the mind's desire and the sacred shrine of pilgrimage, for those unto whom He has given this understanding.
The blessings of the wishes of the mind are obtained, and the fruits of one's desires.
Meditate on the Name, worship the Name, and through the Name, you shall be absorbed in intuitive peace and poise. ||1||
O my mind, drink in the Sublime Essence of the Lord, and your thirst shall be quenched.
Those Gurmukhs who have tasted it remain intuitively absorbed in the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Those who serve the True Guru obtain the Treasure of the Naam.
Deep within, they are drenched with the Essence of the Lord, and the egotistical pride of the mind is subdued.
The heart-lotus blossoms forth, and they intuitively center themselves in meditation.
Their minds become pure, and they remain immersed in the Lord; they are honored in His Court. ||2||
Those who serve the True Guru in this world are very rare.
Those who keep the Lord enshrined in their hearts subdue egotism and possessiveness.
I am a sacrifice to those who are in love with the Naam.
Those who attain the Inexhaustible Name of the Infinite Lord remain happy throughout the four ages. ||3||
Meeting with the Guru, the Naam is obtained, and the thirst of emotional attachment departs.
When the mind is permeated with the Lord, one remains detached within the home of the heart.
I am a sacrifice to those who enjoy the Sublime Taste of the Lord.
O Nanak, by His Glance of Grace, the True Name, the Treasure of Excellence, is obtained. ||4||1||34||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
People wear all sorts of costumes and wander all around, but in their hearts and minds, they practice deception.
They do not attain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, and after death, they sink into manure. ||1||
O mind, remain detached in the midst of your household.
Practicing truth, self-discipline and good deeds, the Gurmukh is enlightened. ||1||Pause||
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the mind is conquered, and one attains the State of Liberation in one's own home.
So meditate on the Name of the Lord; join and merge with the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. ||2||
You may enjoy the pleasures of hundreds of thousands of women, and rule the nine continents of the world.
But without the True Guru, you will not find peace; you will be reincarnated over and over again. ||3||
Those who wear the Necklace of the Lord around their necks, and focus their consciousness on the Guru's Feet -
wealth and supernatural spiritual powers follow them, but they do not care for such things at all. ||4||
Whatever pleases God's Will comes to pass. Nothing else can be done.
Servant Nanak lives by chanting the Naam. O Lord, please give it to me, in Your Natural Way. ||5||2||35||
