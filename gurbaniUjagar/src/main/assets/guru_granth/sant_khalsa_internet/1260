This mind plays, subject to the Lord's Will; in an instant, it wanders out in the ten directions and returns home again.
When the True Lord God Himself bestows His Glance of Grace, then this mind is instantly brought under control by the Gurmukh. ||3||
The mortal comes to know the ways and means of the mind, realizing and contemplating the Shabad.
O Nanak, meditate forever on the Naam, and cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||4||6||
Malaar, Third Mehl:
Soul, body and breath of life are all His; He is permeating and pervading each and every heart.
Except the One Lord, I do not know any other at all. The True Guru has revealed this to me. ||1||
O my mind, remain lovingly attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I meditate on the Lord, the Unseen, Unfathomable and Infinite Creator. ||1||Pause||
Mind and body are pleased, lovingly attuned to the One Lord, intuitively absorbed in peace and poise.
By Guru's Grace, doubt and fear are dispelled, being lovingly attuned to the One Name. ||2||
When the mortal follows the Guru's Teachings, and lives the Truth, then he attains the state of emancipation.
Among millions, how rare is that one who understands, and is lovingly attuned to the Name of the Lord. ||3||
Wherever I look, there I see the One. This understanding has come through the Guru's Teachings.
I place my mind, body and breath of life in offering before Him; O Nanak, self-conceit is gone. ||4||7||
Malaar, Third Mehl:
My True Lord God, the Eradicator of suffering, is found through the Word of the Shabad.

My God is totally Inaccessible and Unfathomable; through the Guru's Teachings, He is understood.
True self-discipline rests in singing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises, lovingly attuned to the Lord. ||2||
He Himself is the Shabad, and He Himself is the True Teachings; He merges our light into the Light.

He Himself fashions, and He Himself links us to our tasks; the True Lord is pervading everywhere.
O Nanak, without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, no one is anything. Through the Naam, we are blessed with glory. ||4||8||
Malaar, Third Mehl:
The mortal is enticed by the poison of corruption, burdened with such a heavy load.
The Lord has placed the magic spell of the Shabad into his mouth, and destroyed the poison of ego. ||1||
O mortal, egotism and attachment are such heavy loads of pain.
This terrifying world-ocean cannot be crossed; through the Lord's Name, the Gurmukh crosses over to the other side. ||1||Pause||
Attachment to the three-phased show of Maya pervades all the created forms.
In the Sat Sangat, the Society of the Saints, the state of supreme awareness is attained. The Merciful Lord carries us across. ||2||
The smell of sandalwood is so sublime; its fragrance spreads out far and wide.
