As You cause me to speak, so do I speak, O Lord Master. What other power do I have?
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O Nanak, sing His Praises; they are so very dear to God. ||8||1||8||
Goojaree, Fifth Mehl, Fourth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O Lord, Man-lion Incarnate, Companion to the poor, Divine Purifier of sinners;
O Destroyer of fear and dread, Merciful Lord Master, Treasure of Excellence, fruitful is Your service. ||1||
O Lord, Cherisher of the World, Guru-Lord of the Universe.
I seek the Sanctuary of Your Feet, O Merciful Lord. Carry me across the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||Pause||
O Dispeller of sexual desire and anger, Eliminator of intoxication and attachment, Destroyer of ego, Honey of the mind;
set me free from birth and death, O Sustainer of the earth, and preserve my honor, O Embodiment of supreme bliss. ||2||
The many waves of desire for Maya are burnt away, when the Guru's spiritual wisdom is enshrined in the heart, through the Guru's Mantra.
Destroy my egotism, O Merciful Lord; dispel my anxiety, O Infinite Primal Lord. ||3||
Remember in meditation the Almighty Lord, every moment and every instant; meditate on God in the celestial peace of Samaadhi.
O Merciful to the meek, perfectly blissful Lord, I beg for the dust of the feet of the Holy. ||4||
Emotional attachment is false, desire is filthy, and longing is corrupt.
Please, preserve my faith, dispel these doubts from my mind, and save me, O Formless Lord. ||5||
They have become wealthy, loaded with the treasures of the Lord's riches; they were lacking even clothes.
The idiotic, foolish and senseless people have become virtuous and patient, receiving the Gracious Glance of the Lord of wealth. ||6||
Become Jivan-Mukta, liberated while yet alive, by meditating on the Lord of the Universe, O mind, and maintaining faith in Him in your heart.
Show kindness and mercy to all beings, and realize that the Lord is pervading everywhere; this is the way of life of the enlightened soul, the supreme swan. ||7||
He grants the Blessed Vision of His Darshan to those who listen to His Praises, and who, with their tongues, chant His Name.
They are part and parcel, life and limb with the Lord God; O Nanak, they feel the Touch of God, the Savior of sinners. ||8||1||2||5||1||1||2||57||
Goojaree Ki Vaar, Third Mehl, Sung In The Tune Of The Vaar Of Sikandar & Biraahim:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Shalok, Third Mehl:
This world perishing in attachment and possessiveness; no one knows the way of life.
One who walks in harmony with the Guru's Will, obtains the supreme status of life.
Those humble beings who focus their consciousness on the Lord's Feet, live forever and ever.
O Nanak, by His Grace, the Lord abides in the minds of the Gurmukhs, who merge in celestial bliss. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Within the self is the pain of doubt; engrossed in worldly affairs, they are killing themselves.
Asleep in the love of duality, they never wake up; they are in love with, and attached to Maya.
They do not think of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and they do not contemplate the Word of the Shabad. This is the conduct of the self-willed manmukhs.
