Malaar, Fifth Mehl:
O Lord of the Universe, O Lord of the World, O Dear Merciful Beloved. ||1||Pause||
You are the Master of the breath of life, the Companion of the lost and forsaken, the Destroyer of the pains of the poor. ||1||
O All-powerful, Inaccessible, Perfect Lord, please shower me with Your Mercy. ||2||
Please, carry Nanak across the terrible, deep dark pit of the world to the other side. ||3||8||30||
Malaar, First Mehl, Ashtapadees, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The chakvi bird does not long for sleepy eyes; without her beloved, she does not sleep.
When the sun rises, she sees her beloved with her eyes; she bows and touches his feet. ||1||
The Love of my Beloved is pleasing; it is my Companion and Support.
Without Him, I cannot live in this world even for an instant; such is my hunger and thirst. ||1||Pause||
The lotus in the pool blossoms forth intuitively and naturally, with the rays of the sun in the sky.
Such is the love for my Beloved which imbues me; my light has merged into the Light. ||2||
Without water, the rainbird cries out, "Pri-o! Pri-o! - Beloved! Beloved!" It cries and wails and laments.
The thundering clouds rain down in the ten directions; its thirst is not quenched until it catches the rain-drop in its mouth. ||3||
The fish lives in water, from which it was born. It finds peace and pleasure according to its past actions.
It cannot survive without water for a moment, even for an instant. Life and death depend on it. ||4||
The soul-bride is separated from her Husband Lord, who lives in His Own Country. He sends the Shabad, His Word, through the True Guru.
She gathers virtues, and enshrines God within her heart. Imbued with devotion, she is happy. ||5||
Everyone cries out, "Beloved! Beloved!" But she alone finds her Beloved, who is pleasing to the Guru.
Our Beloved is always with us; through the Truth, He blesses us with His Grace, and unites us in His Union. ||6||
He is the life of the soul in each and every soul; He permeates and pervades each and every heart.
By Guru's Grace, He is revealed within the home of my heart; I am intuitively, naturally, absorbed into Him. ||7||
He Himself shall resolve all your affairs, when you meet with the Giver of peace, the Lord of the World.
By Guru's Grace, you shall find your Husband Lord within your own home; then, O Nanak, the fire within you shall be quenched. ||8||1||
Malaar, First Mehl:
Remain awake and aware, serving the Guru; except for the Lord, no one is mine.
Even by making all sorts of efforts, you shall not remain here; it shall melt like glass in the fire. ||1||
Tell me - why are you so proud of your body and wealth?
They shall vanish in an instant; O madman, this is how the world is wasting away, in egotism and pride. ||1||Pause||
Hail to the Lord of the Universe, God, our Saving Grace; He judges and saves the mortal beings.
All that is, belongs to You. No one else is equal to You. ||2||
Creating all beings and creatures, their ways and means are under Your control; You bless the Gurmukhs with the ointment of spiritual wisdom.
My Eternal, Unmastered Lord is over the heads of all. He is the Destroyer of death and rebirth, doubt and fear. ||3||
