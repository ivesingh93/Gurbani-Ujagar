One who praises You obtains everything; You bestow Your Mercy upon him, O Immaculate Lord.
He alone is a true banker and trader, who loads the merchandise of the wealth of the Your Name, O Lord.
O Saints, let everyone praise the Lord, who has destroyed the pile of the love of duality. ||16||
Shalok:
Kabeer, the world is dying - dying to death, but no one knows how to truly die.
Whoever dies, let him die such a death, that he does not have to die again. ||1||
Third Mehl:
What do I know? How will I die? What sort of death will it be?
If I do not forget the Lord Master from my mind, then my death will be easy.
The world is terrified of death; everyone longs to live.
By Guru's Grace, one who dies while yet alive, understands the Lord's Will.
O Nanak, one who dies such a death, lives forever. ||2||
Pauree:
When the Lord Master Himself becomes merciful, the Lord Himself causes His Name to be chanted.
He Himself causes us to meet the True Guru, and blesses us with peace. His servant is pleasing to the Lord.
He Himself preserves the honor of His servants; He causes others to fall at the feet of His devotees.
The Righteous Judge of Dharma is a creation of the Lord; he does not approach the humble servant of the Lord.
One who is dear to the Lord, is dear to all; so many others come and go in vain. ||17||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
The entire world roams around, chanting, "Raam, Raam, Lord, Lord", but the Lord cannot be obtained like this.
He is inaccessible, unfathomable and so very great; He is unweighable, and cannot be weighed.
No one can evaluate Him; He cannot be purchased at any price.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, His mystery is known; in this way, He comes to dwell in the mind.
O Nanak, He Himself is infinite; by Guru's Grace, He is known to be permeating and pervading everywhere.
He Himself comes to blend, and having blended, remains blended. ||1||
Third Mehl:
O my soul, this is the wealth of the Naam; through it, comes peace, forever and ever.
It never brings any loss; through it, one earns profits forever.
Eating and spending it, it never decreases; He continues to give, forever and ever.
One who has no skepticism at all never suffers humiliation.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh obtains the Name of the Lord, when the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace. ||2||
Pauree:
He Himself is deep within all hearts, and He Himself is outside them.
He Himself is prevailing unmanifest, and He Himself is manifest.
For thirty-six ages, He created the darkness, abiding in the void.
There were no Vedas, Puraanas or Shaastras there; only the Lord Himself existed.
He Himself sat in the absolute trance, withdrawn from everything.
Only He Himself knows His state; He Himself is the unfathomable ocean. ||18||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
In egotism, the world is dead; it dies and dies, again and again.
