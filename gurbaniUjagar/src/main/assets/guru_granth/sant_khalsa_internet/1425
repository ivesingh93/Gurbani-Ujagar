Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
They alone are imbued with the Lord, who do not turn their faces away from Him - they realize Him.
The false, immature lovers do not know the way of love, and so they fall. ||1||
Without my Master, I will burn my silk and satin clothes in the fire.
Even rolling in the dust, I look beautiful, O Nanak, if my Husband Lord is with me. ||2||
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I worship and adore the Naam, with love and balanced detachment.
When the five enemies are overcome, O Nanak, this musical measure of Raga Maaroo becomes fruitful. ||3||
When I have the One Lord, I have tens of thousands. Otherwise, people like me beg from door to door.
O Brahmin, your life has passed away uselessly; you have forgotten the One who created you. ||4||
In Raga Sorat'h, drink in this sublime essence, which never loses its taste.
O Nanak, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord's Name, one's reputation is immaculate in the Court of the Lord. ||5||
No one can kill those whom God Himself protects.
The treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is within them. They cherish His Glorious Virtues forever.
They take the Support of the One, the Inaccessible Lord; they enshrine God in their mind and body.
They are imbued with the Love of the Infinite Lord, and no one can wipe it away.
The Gurmukhs sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord; they obtain the most excellent celestial peace and poise.
O Nanak, they enshrine the treasure of the Naam in their hearts. ||6||
Whatever God does, accept that as good; leave behind all other judgments.
He shall cast His Glance of Grace, and attach you to Himself.
Instruct yourself with the Teachings, and doubt will depart from within.
Everyone does that which is pre-ordained by destiny.
Everything is under His control; there is no other place at all.
Nanak is in peace and bliss, accepting the Will of God. ||7||
Those who meditate in remembrance on the Perfect Guru, are exalted and uplifted.
O Nanak, dwelling on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, all affairs are resolved. ||8||
The sinners act, and generate bad karma, and then they weep and wail.
O Nanak, just as the churning stick churns the butter, so does the Righteous Judge of Dharma churn them. ||9||
Meditating on the Naam, O friend, the treasure of life is won.
O Nanak, speaking in Righteousness, one's world becomes sanctified. ||10||
I am stuck in an evil place, trusting the sweet words of an evil advisor.
O Nanak, they alone are saved, who have such good destiny inscribed upon their foreheads. ||11||
They alone sleep and dream in peace, who are imbued with the Love of their Husband Lord.
Those who have been separated from the Love of their Master, scream and cry twenty-four hours a day. ||12||
Millions are asleep, in the false illusion of Maya.
O Nanak, they alone are awake and aware, who chant the Naam with their tongues. ||13||
Seeing the mirage, the optical illusion, the people are confused and deluded.
Those who worship and adore the True Lord, O Nanak, their minds and bodies are beautiful. ||14||
The All-powerful Supreme Lord God, the Infinite Primal Being, is the Saving Grace of sinners.
