Those who eat and drink the Fear of God, find the most excellent peace.
Associating with the humble servants of the Lord, they are carried across.
They speak the Truth, and lovingly inspire others to speak it as well.
The Word of the Guru's Shabad is the most excellent occupation. ||7||
Those who take the Lord's Praises as their karma and Dharma, their honor and worship service
NAME?
They taste the sublime essence of the Lord, and their minds are drenched with it.
Prays Nanak, there is no other at all. ||8||5||
Prabhaatee, First Mehl:
Chant the Lord's Name, and worship Him deep within your being.
Contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and no other. ||1||
The One is pervading all places.
I do not see any other; unto whom should I offer worship? ||1||Pause||
I place my mind and body in offering before You; I dedicate my soul to You.
As it pleases You, You save me, Lord; this is my prayer. ||2||
True is that tongue which is delighted by the sublime essence of the Lord.
Following the Guru's Teachings, one is saved in the Sanctuary of God. ||3||
My God created religious rituals.
He placed the glory of the Naam above these rituals. ||4||
The four great blessings are under the control of the True Guru.
When the first three are put aside, one is blessed with the fourth. ||5||
Those whom the True Guru blesses with liberation and meditation
realize the Lord's State, and become sublime. ||6||
Their minds and bodies are cooled and soothed; the Guru imparts this understanding.
Who can estimate the value of those whom God has exalted? ||7||
Says Nanak, the Guru has imparted this understanding;
without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, no one is emancipated. ||8||6||
Prabhaatee, First Mehl:
Some are forgiven by the Primal Lord God; the Perfect Guru makes the true making.
Those who are attuned to the Love of the Lord are imbued with Truth forever; their pains are dispelled, and they obtain honor. ||1||
False are the clever tricks of the evil-minded.
They shall disappear in no time at all. ||1||Pause||
Pain and suffering afflict the self-willed manmukh. The pains of the self-willed manmukh shall never depart.
The Gurmukh recognizes the Giver of pleasure and pain. He merges in His Sanctuary. ||2||
The self-willed manmukhs do not know loving devotional worship; they are insane, rotting away in their egotism.
This mind flies in an instant from the heavens to the underworld, as long as it does not know the Word of the Shabad. ||3||
The world has become hungry and thirsty; without the True Guru, it is not satisfied.
Merging intuitively in the Celestial Lord, peace is obtained, and one goes to the Lord's Court wearing robes of honor. ||4||
The Lord in His Court is Himself the Knower and Seer; the Word of the Guru's Bani is Immaculate.
He Himself is the Awareness of Truth; He Himself understands the state of nirvaanaa. ||5||
He made the waves of water, the fire and the air, and then joined the three together to form the world.
He blessed these elements with such power, that they remain subject to His Command. ||6||
How rare are those humble beings in this world, whom the Lord tests and places in His Treasury.
They rise above social status and color, and rid themselves of possessiveness and greed. ||7||
Attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Lord, they are like immaculate sacred shrines; they are rid of the pain and pollution of egotism.
Nanak washes the feet of those who, as Gurmukh, love the True Lord. ||8||7||
