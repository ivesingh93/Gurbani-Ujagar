Says Nanak, joining the Society of the Saints, I am enraptured, lovingly attuned to my Lord. ||2||25||48||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Sing of your Lord and Master, your Best Friend.
Do not place your hopes in anyone else; meditate on God, the Giver of peace. ||1||Pause||
Peace, joy and salvation are in His Home. Seek the Protection of His Sanctuary.
But if you forsake Him, and serve mortal beings, your honor will dissolve like salt in water. ||1||
I have grasped the Anchor and Support of my Lord and Master; meeting with the Guru, I have found wisdom and understanding.
Nanak has met God, the Treasure of Excellence; all dependence on others is gone. ||2||26||49||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
I have the Almighty Support of my Dear Lord God.
I do not look up to anyone else. My honor and glory are Yours, O God. ||1||Pause||
God has taken my side; He has lifted me up and pulled me out of the whirlpool of corruption.
He has poured the medicine of the Naam, the Ambrosial Name of the Lord, into my mouth; I have fallen at the Guru's Feet. ||1||
How can I praise You with only one mouth? You are generous, even to the unworthy.
You cut away the noose, and now You own me; Nanak is blessed with myriad joys. ||2||27||50||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Remembering God in meditation, pains are dispelled.
When the Giver of peace to the soul becomes merciful, the mortal is totally redeemed. ||1||Pause||
I know of none other than God; tell me, who else should I approach?
As You know me, so do You keep me, O my Lord and Master. I have surrendered everything to You. ||1||
God gave me His Hand and saved me; He has blessed me with eternal life.
Says Nanak, my mind is in ecstasy; the noose of death has been cut away from my neck. ||2||28||51||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
My mind contemplates You, O Lord, all the time.
I am Your meek and helpless child; You are God my Father. As You know me, You save me. ||1||Pause||
When I am hungry, I ask for food; when I am full, I am totally at peace.
When I dwell with You, I am free of disease; if I become separated from You, I turn to dust. ||1||
What power does the slave of Your slave have, O Establisher and Disestablisher?
If I do not forget the Naam, the Name of the Lord, then I die. Nanak offers this prayer. ||2||29||52||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
I have shaken off fear and dread from my mind.
With intuitive ease, peace and poise, I sing the Glorious Praises of my Kind, Sweet, Darling Beloved. ||1||Pause||
Practicing the Guru's Word, by His Grace, I do not wander anywhere anymore.
The illusion has been dispelled; I am in Samaadhi, Sukh-aasan, the position of peace. I have found the Lord, the Lover of His devotees, within the home of my own heart. ||1||
| The Sound-current of the Naad, playful joys and pleasures - I am intuitively, easily absorbed into the Celestial Lord.
He Himself is the Creator, the Cause of causes. Says Nanak, He Himself is All-in-all. ||2||30||53||
