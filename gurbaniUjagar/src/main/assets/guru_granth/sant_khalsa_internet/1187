What makes you think that it is real? ||1||
Wealth, spouse, property and household-
none of them shall go along with you; you must know that this is true! ||2||
Only devotion to the Lord shall go with you.
Says Nanak, vibrate and meditate on the Lord with single-minded love. ||3||4||
Basant, Ninth Mehl:
Why do you wander lost, O mortal, attached to falsehood and greed?
Nothing has been lost yet - there is still time to wake up! ||1||Pause||
You must realize that this world is nothing more than a dream.
In an instant, it shall perish; know this as true. ||1||
The Lord constantly abides with you.
Night and day, vibrate and meditate on Him, O my friend. ||2||
At the very last instant, He shall be your Help and Support.
Says Nanak, sing His Praises. ||3||5||
Basant, First Mehl, Ashtapadees, First House, Du-Tukees:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The world is a crow; it does not remember the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Forgetting the Naam, it sees the bait, and pecks at it.
The mind wavers unsteadily, in guilt and deceit.
I have shattered my attachment to the false world. ||1||
The burden of sexual desire, anger and corruption is unbearable.
Without the Naam, how can the mortal maintain a virtuous lifestyle? ||1||Pause||
The world is like a house of sand, built on a whirlpool;
it is like a bubble formed by drops of rain.
It is formed from a mere drop, when the Lord's wheel turns round.
The lights of all souls are the servants of the Lord's Name. ||2||
My Supreme Guru has created everything.
I perform devotional worship service to You, and fall at Your Feet, O Lord.
Imbued with Your Name, I long to be Yours.
Those who do not let the Naam become manifest within themselves, depart like thieves in the end. ||3||
The mortal loses his honor, gathering sin and corruption.
But imbued with the Lord's Name, you shall go to your true home with honor.
God does whatever He wills.
One who abides in the Fear of God, becomes fearless, O my mother. ||4||
The woman desires beauty and pleasure.
But betel leaves, garlands of flowers and sweet tastes lead only to disease.
The more she plays and enjoys, the more she suffers in sorrow.
But when she enters into the Sanctuary of God, whatever she wishes comes to pass. ||5||
She wears beautiful clothes with all sorts of decorations.
But the flowers turn to dust, and her beauty leads her into evil.
Hope and desire have blocked the doorway.
Without the Naam, one's hearth and home are deserted. ||6||
O princess, my daughter, run away from this place!
Chant the True Name, and embellish your days.
Serve your Beloved Lord God, and lean on the Support of His Love.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, abandon your thirst for corruption and poison. ||7||
My Fascinating Lord has fascinated my mind.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I have realized You, Lord.
Nanak stands longingly at God's Door.
I am content and satisfied with Your Name; please shower me with Your Mercy. ||8||1||
Basant, First Mehl:
The mind is deluded by doubt; it comes and goes in reincarnation.
It is lured by the poisonous lure of Maya.
It does not remain stable in the Love of the One Lord.
Like the fish, its neck is pierced by the hook. ||1||
The deluded mind is instructed by the True Name.
It contemplates the Word of the Guru's Shabad, with intuitive ease. ||1||Pause||
