Says Nanak, I have found the Lord with intuitive ease, within the home of my own heart. Devotional worship of the Lord is a treasure over-flowing. ||2||10||33||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
O my Enticing Lord, all beings are Yours - You save them.
Even a tiny bit of Your Mercy ends all cruelty and tyranny. You save and redeem millions of universes. ||1||Pause||
I offer countless prayers; I remember You each and every instant.
Please be merciful to me, O Destroyer of the pains of the poor; please give me Your hand and save me. ||1||
And what about these poor kings? Tell me, who can they kill?
Save me, save me, save me, O Giver of peace; O Nanak, all the world is Yours. ||2||11||34||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Now I have obtained the wealth of the Lord's Name.
I have become carefree, and all my thirsty desires are satisfied. Such is the destiny written on my forehead. ||1||Pause||
Searching and searching, I became depressed; I wandered all around, and finally came back to my body-village.
The Merciful Guru made this deal, and I have obtained the priceless jewel. ||1||
The other deals and trades which I did, brought only sorrow and suffering.
Fearless are those traders who deal in meditation on the Lord of the Universe. O Nanak, the Lord's Name is their capital. ||2||12||35||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
The Speech of my Beloved seems so sweet to my mind.
The Guru has taken hold of my arm, and linked me to God's service. My Beloved Lord is forever merciful to me. ||1||Pause||
O God, You are my Lord and Master; You are the Cherisher of all. My wife and I are totally Your slaves.
You are all my honor and power - You are. Your Name is my only Support. ||1||
If You seat me on the throne, then I am Your slave. If You make me a grass-cutter, then what can I say?
Servant Nanak's God is the Primal Lord, the Architect of Destiny, Unfathomable and Immeasurable. ||2||13||36||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
The tongue becomes beautiful, uttering the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
In an instant, He creates and destroys. Gazing upon His Wondrous Plays, my mind is fascinated. ||1||Pause||
Listening to His Praises, my mind is in utter ecstasy, and my heart is rid of pride and pain.
I have found peace, and my pains have been taken away, since I became one with God. ||1||
Sinful resides have been wiped away, and my mind is immaculate. The Guru has lifted me up and pulled me out of the deception of Maya.
Says Nanak, I have found God, the All-powerful Creator, the Cause of causes. ||2||14||37||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
With my eyes, I have seen the marvelous wonders of the Lord.
He is far from all, and yet near to all. He is Inaccessible and Unfathomable, and yet He dwells in the heart. ||1||Pause||
The Infallible Lord never makes a mistake. He does not have to write His Orders, and He does not have to consult with anyone.
In an instant, He creates, embellishes and destroys. He is the Lover of His devotees, the Treasure of Excellence. ||1||
Lighting the lamp in the deep dark pit, the Guru illumines and enlightens the heart.
