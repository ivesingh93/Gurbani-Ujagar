O Nanak, the Gurmukh is blessed with the Naam. ||4||4||56||
Aasaa, Fourth Mehl:
I sing His Glorious Praises, and through the Word of His Bani, I speak His Glorious Praises.
As Gurmukh, I chant and recite the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||
Chanting and meditating on the Naam, my mind becomes blissful.
The True Guru has implanted the True Name of the True Lord within me; I sing His Glorious Praises, and taste the supreme ecstasy. ||1||Pause||
The humble servants of the Lord sing the Lord's Glorious Praises.
By great good fortune, the detached, absolute Lord is obtained. ||2||
Those without virtue are stained by Maya's filth.
Lacking virtue, the egotistical die, and suffer reincarnation. ||3||
The ocean of the body yields pearls of virtue.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh churns this ocean, and discovers this essence. ||4||5||57||
Aasaa, Fourth Mehl:
I listen to the Naam, the Name of the Lord; the Naam is pleasing to my mind.
By great good fortune, the Gurmukh obtains the Lord. ||1||
Chant the Naam, as Gurmukh, and be exalted.
Without the Naam, I have no other support; the Naam is woven into all my breaths and morsels of food. ||1||Pause||
The Naam illuminates my mind; listening to it, my mind is pleased.
One who speaks the Naam - he alone is my friend and companion. ||2||
Without the Naam, the fools depart naked.
They burn away to death, chasing the poison of Maya, like the moth chasing the flame. ||3||
He Himself establishes, and, having established, disestablishes.
O Nanak, the Lord Himself bestows the Naam. ||4||6||58||
Aasaa, Fourth Mehl:
The vine of the Lord's Name, Har, Har, has taken root in the Gurmukh.
It bears the fruit of the Lord; its taste is so tasty! ||1||
Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, in endless waves of joy.
Chant and repeat the Naam; through the Guru's Teachings praise the Lord, and slay the horrible serpent of the Messenger of Death. ||1||Pause||
The Lord has implanted His devotional worship in the Guru.
When the Guru is pleased, He bestows it upon His Sikh, O my siblings of Destiny. ||2||
One who acts in ego, knows nothing about the Way.
He acts like an elephant, who takes a bath, and then throws dust on his head. ||3||
If one's destiny is great and exalted,
O Nanak, one chants the Naam, the Name of the Immaculate, True Lord. ||4||7||59||
Aasaa, Fourth Mehl:
My mind suffers hunger for the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
Hearing the Naam, my mind is satisfied, O my Siblings of Destiny. ||1||
Chant the Naam, O my friends, O GurSikhs.
Chant the Naam, and through the Naam, obtain peace; through the Guru's Teachings, enshrine the Naam in your heart and mind. ||1||Pause||
Hearing the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the mind is in bliss.
Reaping the profit of the Naam, through the Guru's Teachings, my soul has blossomed forth. ||2||
Without the Naam, the mortal is a leper, blinded by emotional attachment.
All his actions are fruitless; they lead only to painful entanglements. ||3||
The very fortunate ones chant the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har, Har.
O Nanak, through the Guru's Teachings, one embraces love for the Naam. ||4||8||60||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
