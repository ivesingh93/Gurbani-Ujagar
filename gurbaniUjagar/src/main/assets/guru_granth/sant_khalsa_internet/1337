Prabhaatee, Fourth Mehl:
The Guru, the True Guru, has implanted the Naam, the Name of the Lord within me. I was dead, but chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, I have been brought back to life.
Blessed, blessed is the Guru, the Guru, the Perfect True Guru; He reached out to me with His Arm, and pulled me up and out of the ocean of poison. ||1||
O mind, meditate and worship the Lord's Name.
God is never found, even by making all sorts of new efforts. The Lord God is obtained only through the Perfect Guru. ||1||Pause||
The Sublime Essence of the Lord's Name is the source of nectar and bliss; drinking in this Sublime Essence, following the Guru's Teachings, I have become happy.
Even iron slag is transformed into gold, joining the Lord's Congregation. Through the Guru, the Lord's Light is enshrined within the heart. ||2||
Those who are continually lured by greed, egotism and corruption, who are lured away by emotional attachment to their children and spouse
- they never serve at the feet of the Saints; those self-willed manmukhs are filled with ashes. ||3||
O God, You alone know Your Glorious Virtues; I have grown weary - I seek Your Sanctuary.
As You know best, You preserve and protect me, O my Lord and Master; servant Nanak is Your slave. ||4||6|| One Chhakaa||
Prabhaatee, Bibhaas, Partaal, Fourth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O mind, meditate on the Treasure of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
You shall be honored in the Court of the Lord.
Those who chant and meditate shall be carried across to the other shore. ||1||Pause||
Listen, O mind: meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
Listen, O mind: the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises is equal to bathing at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage.
Listen, O mind: as Gurmukh, you shall be blessed with honor. ||1||
O mind, chant and meditate on the Supreme Transcendent Lord God.
Millions of sins shall be destroyed in an instant.
O Nanak, you shall meet with the Lord God. ||2||1||7||
Prabhaatee, Fifth Mehl, Bibhaas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The Lord created the mind, and fashioned the entire body.
From the five elements, He formed it, and infused His Light within it.
He made the earth its bed, and water for it to use.
Do not forget Him for an instant; serve the Lord of the World. ||1||
O mind, serve the True Guru, and obtain the supreme status.
If you remain unattached and unaffected by sorrow and joy, then you shall find the Lord of Life. ||1||Pause||
He makes all the various pleasures, clothes and foods for you to enjoy.
He made your mother, father and all relatives.
He provides sustenance to all, in the water and on the land, O friend.
So serve the Lord, forever and ever. ||2||
He shall be your Helper and Support there, where no one else can help you.
He washes away millions of sins in an instant.
He bestows His Gifts, and never regrets them.
He forgives, once and for all, and never asks for one's account again. ||3||
