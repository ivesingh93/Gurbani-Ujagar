He is like the crop planted in the salty soil, or the tree growing on the river bank, or the white clothes sprinkled with dirt.
This world is the house of desire; whoever enters it, is burnt down by egotistical pride. ||6||
Where are all the kings and their subjects? Those who are immersed in duality are destroyed.
Says Nanak, these are the steps of the ladder, of the Teachings of the True Guru; only the Unseen Lord shall remain. ||7||3||11||
Maaroo, Third Mehl, Fifth House, Ashtapadees:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
One whose mind is filled with the Lord's Love,
is intuitively exalted by the True Word of the Shabad.
He alone knows the pain of this love; what does anyone else know about its cure? ||1||
He Himself unites in His Union.
He Himself inspires us with His Love.
He alone appreciates the value of Your Love, upon whom You shower Your Grace, O Lord. ||1||Pause||
One whose spiritual vision is awakened - his doubt is driven out.
By Guru's Grace, he obtains the supreme status.
He alone is a Yogi, who understands this way, and contemplates the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||2||
By good destiny, the soul-bride is united with her Husband Lord.
Following the Guru's Teachings, she eradicates her evil-mindedness from within.
With love, she continually enjoys pleasure with Him; she becomes the beloved of her Husband Lord. ||3||
Other than the True Guru, there is no physician.
He Himself is the Immaculate Lord.
Meeting with the True Guru, evil is conquered, and spiritual wisdom is contemplated. ||4||
One who is committed to this most sublime Shabad
becomes Gurmukh, and is rid of thirst and hunger.
By one's own efforts, nothing can be accomplished; the Lord, in His Mercy, bestows power. ||5||
The True Guru has revealed the essence of the Shaastras and the Vedas.
In His Mercy, He has come into the home of my self.
In the midst of Maya, the Immaculate Lord is known, by those upon whom You bestow Your Grace. ||6||
One who becomes Gurmukh, obtains the essence of reality;
he eradicates his self-conceit from within.
Without the True Guru, all are entangled in worldly affairs; consider this in your mind, and see. ||7||
Some are deluded by doubt; they strut around egotistically.
Some, as Gurmukh, subdue their egotism.
Attuned to the True Word of the Shabad, they remain detached from the world. The other ignorant fools wander, confused and deluded by doubt. ||8||
Those who have not become Gurmukh, and who have not found the Naam, the Name of the Lord -
those self-willed Manmukhs waste their lives uselessly.
In the world hereafter, nothing except the Name will be of any assistance; this is understood by contemplating the Guru. ||9||
The Ambrosial Naam is the Giver of peace forever.
Throughout the four ages, it is known through the Perfect Guru.
He alone receives it, unto whom You bestow it; this is the essence of reality which Nanak has realized. ||10||1||
