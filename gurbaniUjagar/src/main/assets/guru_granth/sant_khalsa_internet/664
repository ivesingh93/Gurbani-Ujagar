O Nanak, obtains the Naam; his mind is pleased and appeased. ||4||1||
Dhanaasaree, Third Mehl:
The wealth of the Lord's Name is immaculate, and absolutely infinite.
The Word of the Guru's Shabad is over-flowing with treasure.
Know that, except for the wealth of the Name, all other wealth is poison.
The egotistical people are burning in their attachment to Maya. ||1||
How rare is that Gurmukh who tastes the sublime essence of the Lord.
He is always in bliss, day and night; through perfect good destiny, he obtains the Name. ||Pause||
The Word of the Shabad is a lamp, illuminating the three worlds.
One who tastes it, becomes immaculate.
The immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord, washes off the filth of ego.
True devotional worship brings lasting peace. ||2||
One who tastes the sublime essence of the Lord is the Lord's humble servant.
He is forever happy; he is never sad.
He himself is liberated, and he liberates others as well.
He chants the Lord's Name, and through the Lord, he finds peace. ||3||
Without the True Guru, everyone dies, crying out in pain.
Night and day, they burn, and find no peace.
But meeting the True Guru, all thirst is quenched.
O Nanak, through the Naam, one finds peace and tranquility. ||4||2||
Dhanaasaree, Third Mehl:
Gather in and cherish forever the wealth of the Lord's Name, deep within;
He cherishes and nurtures all beings and creatures.
They alone obtain the treasure of Liberation,
who are lovingly imbued with, and focused on the Lord's Name. ||1||
Serving the Guru, one obtains the wealth of the Lord's Name.
He is illumined and enlightened within, and he meditates on the Lord's Name. ||Pause||
This love for the Lord is like the love of the bride for her husband.
God ravishes and enjoys the soul-bride who is adorned with peace and tranquility.
No one finds God through egotism.
Wandering away from the Primal Lord, the root of all, one wastes his life in vain. ||2||
Tranquility, celestial peace, pleasure and the Word of His Bani come from the Guru.
True is that service, which leads one to merge in the Naam.
Blessed with the Word of the Shabad, he meditates forever on the Lord, the Beloved.
Through the True Name, glorious greatness is obtained. ||3||
The Creator Himself abides throughout the ages.
If He casts His Glance of Grace, then we meet Him.
Through the Word of Gurbani, the Lord comes to dwell in the mind.
O Nanak, God unites with Himself those who are imbued with Truth. ||4||3||
Dhanaasaree, Third Mehl:
The world is polluted, and those in the world become polluted as well.
In attachment to duality, it comes and goes.
This love of duality has ruined the entire world.
The self-willed manmukh suffers punishment, and forfeits his honor. ||1||
Serving the Guru, one becomes immaculate.
He enshrines the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within, and his state becomes exalted. ||Pause||
The Gurmukhs are saved, taking to the Lord's Sanctuary.
Attuned to the Lord's Name, they commit themselves to devotional worship.
The Lord's humble servant performs devotional worship, and is blessed with greatness.
Attuned to Truth, he is absorbed in celestial peace. ||2||
Know that one who purchases the True Name is very rare.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he comes to understand himself.
True is his capital, and true is his trade.
Blessed is that person, who loves the Naam. ||3||
God, the True Lord, has attached some to His True Name.
They listen to the most sublime Word of His Bani, and the Word of His Shabad.
