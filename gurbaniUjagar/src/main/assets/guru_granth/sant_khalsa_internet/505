One whose heart is filled with the Hymns of the True Guru, obtains the Pure Lord. He is not under the power of the Messenger of Death, nor does he owe Death anything. ||1||Pause||
He chants the Glorious Praises of the Lord with his tongue, and abides with God; he does whatever pleases the Lord.
Without the Lord's Name, life passes in vain in the world, and every moment is useless. ||2||
The false have no place of rest, either inside or outside; the slanderer does not find salvation.
Even if one is resentful, God does not withhold His blessings; day by day, they increase. ||3||
No one can take away the Guru's gifts; my Lord and Master Himself has given them.
The black-faced slanderers, with slander in their mouths, do not appreciate the Guru's gifts. ||4||
God forgives and blends with Himself those who take to His Sanctuary; He does not delay for an instant.
He is the source of bliss, the Greatest Lord; through the True Guru, we are united in His Union. ||5||
Through His Kindness, the Kind Lord pervades us; through Guru's Teachings, our wanderings cease.
Touching the philosopher's stone, metal is transformed into gold. Such is the glorious greatness of the Society of the Saints. ||6||
The Lord is the immaculate water; the mind is the bather, and the True Guru is the bath attendant, O Siblings of Destiny.
That humble being who joins the Sat Sangat shall not be consigned to reincarnation again; his light merges into the Light. ||7||
You are the Great Primal Lord, the infinite tree of life; I am a bird perched on Your branches.
Grant to Nanak the Immaculate Naam; throughout the ages, he sings the Praises of the Shabad. ||8||4||
Goojaree, First Mehl, Fourth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The devotees worship the Lord in loving adoration. They thirst for the True Lord, with infinite affection.
They tearfully beg and implore the Lord; in love and affection, their consciousness is at peace. ||1||
Chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, O my mind, and take to His Sanctuary.
The Lord's Name is the boat to cross over the world-ocean. Practice such a way of life. ||1||Pause||
O mind, even death wishes you well, when you remember the Lord through the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
The intellect receives the treasure, the knowledge of reality and supreme bliss, by repeating the Lord's Name in the mind. ||2||
The fickle consciousness wanders around chasing after wealth; it is intoxicated with worldly love and emotional attachment.
Devotion to the Naam is permanently implanted within the mind, when it is attuned to the Guru's Teachings and His Shabad. ||3||
Wandering around, doubt is not dispelled; afflicted by reincarnation, the world is being ruined.
The Lord's eternal throne is free of this affliction; he is truly wise, who takes the Naam as his deep meditation. ||4||
This world is engrossed in attachment and transitory love; it suffers the terrible pains of birth and death.
RÃ¼n to the Sanctuary of the True Guru, chant the Lord's Name in your heart, and you shall swim across. ||5||
Following the Guru's Teaching, the mind becomes stable; the mind accepts it, and reflects upon it in peaceful poise.
That mind is pure, which enshrines Truth within, and the most excellent jewel of spiritual wisdom. ||6||
By the Fear of God, and Love of God, and by devotion, man crosses over the terrifying world-ocean, focusing his consciousness on the Lord's Lotus Feet.
