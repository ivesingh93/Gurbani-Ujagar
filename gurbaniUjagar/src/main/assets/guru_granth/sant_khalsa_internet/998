The Ambrosial Name of the Lord is the ocean of peace.
The beggar begs for it; O Lord, please bless him, in Your kindness.
True, True is the Lord; the Lord is forever True; the True Lord is pleasing to my mind. ||2||
The nine holes pour out filth.
Chanting the Lord's Name, they are all purified and sanctified.
When my Lord and Master is totally pleased, He leads the mortal to meditate in remembrance on the Lord, and then his filth is taken away. ||3||
Attachment to Maya is terribly treacherous.
How can one cross over the difficult world-ocean?
The True Lord bestows the boat of the True Guru; meditating on the Lord, Har, Har, one is carried across. ||4||
You are everywhere; all are Yours.
Whatever You do, God, that alone comes to pass.
Poor servant Nanak sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord; as it pleases the Lord, He bestows His approval. ||5||1||7||
Maaroo, Fourth Mehl:
Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my mind.
The Lord shall eradicate all your sins.
Treasure the Lord's wealth, and gather in the Lord's wealth; when you depart in the end, the Lord shall go along with you as your only friend and companion. ||1||
He alone meditates on the Lord, unto whom He grants His Grace.
He continually chants the Lord's Chant; meditating on the Lord, one finds peace.
By Guru's Grace, the sublime essence of the Lord is obtained. Meditating on the Lord, Har, Har, one is carried across. ||1||Pause||
The fearless, formless Lord - the Name is Truth.
To chant it is the most sublime and exalted activity in this world.
Doing so, the Messenger of Death, the evil enemy, is killed. Death does not even approach the Lord's servant. ||2||
One whose mind is satisfied with the Lord -
that servant is known throughout the four ages, in all four directions.
If some sinner speaks evil of him, the Messenger of Death chews him up. ||3||
The One Pure Creator Lord is in all.
He stages all His wondrous plays, and watches them.
Who can kill that person, whom the Lord has saved? The Creator Lord Himself delivers him. ||4||
I chant the Name of the Creator Lord, night and day.
He saves all His servants and devotees.
Consult the eighteen Puraanas and the four Vedas; O servant Nanak, only the Naam, the Name of the Lord, will deliver you. ||5||2||8||
Maaroo, Fifth Mehl, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The earth, the Akaashic ethers and the stars abide in the Fear of God. The almighty Order of the Lord is over the heads of all.
Wind, water and fire abide in the Fear of God; poor Indra abides in the Fear of God as well. ||1||
I have heard one thing, that the One Lord alone is fearless.
He alone is at peace, and he alone is embellished forever, who meets with the Guru, and sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
The embodied and the divine beings abide in the Fear of God. The Siddhas and seekers dIE in the Fear of God.
The 8.4 millions species of beings die, and dIE again, and are born over and over again. They are consigned to reincarnation. ||2||
