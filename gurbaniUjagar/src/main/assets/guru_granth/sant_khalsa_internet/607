The Beloved Himself puts the chains around their necks; as God pulls them, must they go.
Whoever harbors pride shall be destroyed, O Beloved; meditating on the Lord, Nanak is absorbed in devotional worship. ||4||6||
Sorat'h, Fourth Mehl, Du-Tukas:
Separated from the Lord for countless lifetimes, the self-willed manmukh suffers in pain, engaged in acts of egotism.
Beholding the Holy Saint, I found God; O Lord of the Universe, I seek Your Sanctuary. ||1||
The Love of God is very dear to me.
When I joined the Sat Sangat, the Company of the Holy People, the Lord, the embodiment of peace, came into my heart. ||Pause||
You dwell, hidden, within my heart day and night, Lord; but the poor fools do not understand Your Love.
Meeting with the Almighty True Guru, God was revealed to me; I sing His Glorious Praises, and reflect upon His Glories. ||2||
As Gurmukh, I have become enlightened; peace has come, and evil-mindedness has been dispelled from my mind.
Understanding the relationship of the individual soul with God, I have found peace, in Your Sat Sangat, Your True Congregation, O Lord. ||3||
Those who are blessed by Your Kind Mercy, meet the Almighty Lord, and find the Guru.
Nanak has found the immeasurable, celestial peace; night and day, he remains awake to the Lord, the Master of the Forest of the Universe. ||4||7||
Sorat'h, Fourth Mehl:
The inner depths of my mind are pierced by love for the Lord; I cannot live without the Lord.
Just as the fish dies without water, I die without the Lord's Name. ||1||
O my God, please bless me with the water of Your Name.
I beg for Your Name, deep within myself, day and night; through the Name, I find peace. ||Pause||
The song-bird cries out for lack of water - without water, its thirst cannot be quenched.
The Gurmukh obtains the water of celestial bliss, and is rejuvenated, blossoming forth through the blessed Love of the Lord. ||2||
The self-willed manmukhs are hungry, wandering around in the ten directions; without the Name, they suffer in pain.
They are born, only to die, and enter into reincarnation again; in the Court of the Lord, they are punished. ||3||
But if the Lord shows His Mercy, then one comes to sing His Glorious Praises; deep within the nucleus of his own self, he finds the sublime essence of the Lord's elixir.
The Lord has become Merciful to meek Nanak, and through the Word of the Shabad, his desires are quenched. ||4||8||
Sorat'h, Fourth Mehl, Panch-Padas:
If one controls the difficult mind, then he becomes a Siddha, a being of perfect spirituality; through this perfection, he obtains wisdom.
When the arrow of the Lord's Love pierces his body, then his doubt is eradicated. ||1||
O my Lord of the Universe, please bless Your humble servant with glory.
Under Guru's Instructions, enlighten me with the Lord's Name, that I may dwell forever in Your Sanctuary. ||Pause||
This whole world is engrossed in coming and going; O my foolish and ignorant mind, be mindful of the Lord.
O Dear Lord, please, take pity upon me, and unite me with the Guru, that I may merge in the Lord's Name. ||2||
Only one who has it knows God; he alone has it, to whom God has given it-
the so very beautiful, unapproachable and unfathomable. Through the Perfect Guru, the unknowable is known. ||3||
Only one who tastes it knows it, like the mute, who tastes the sweet candy, but cannot speak of it.
