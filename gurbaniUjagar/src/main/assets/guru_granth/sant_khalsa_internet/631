I am a sacrifice to my Guru.
God, the Great Giver, the Perfect One, has become merciful to me, and now, all are kind to me. ||Pause||
Servant Nanak has entered His Sanctuary.
He has perfectly preserved his honor.
All suffering has been dispelled.
So enjoy peace, O my Siblings of Destiny! ||2||28||92||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
Hear my prayer, O my Lord and Master; all beings and creatures were created by You.
You preserve the honor of Your Name, O Lord, Cause of causes. ||1||
O Dear God, Beloved, please, make me Your own.
Whether good or bad, I am Yours. ||Pause||
The Almighty Lord and Master heard my prayer; cutting away my bonds, He has adorned me.
He dressed me in robes of honor, and blended His servant with Himself; Nanak is revealed in glory throughout the world. ||2||29||93||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
All beings and creatures are subservient to all those who serve in the Lord's Court.
Their God made them His own, and carried them across the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||
He resolves all the affairs of His Saints.
He is merciful to the meek, kind and compassionate, the ocean of kindness, my Perfect Lord and Master. ||Pause||
I am asked to come and be seated, everywhere I go, and I lack nothing.
The Lord blesses His humble devotee with robes of honor; O Nanak, the Glory of God is manifest. ||2||30||94||
Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O mind, love the Lord.
With your ears, hear the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe, and with your tongue, sing His song. ||1||Pause||
Join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and meditate in remembrance on the Lord; even a sinner like yourself will become pure.
Death is on the prowl, with its mouth wide open, friend. ||1||
Today or tomorrow, eventually it will seize you; understand this in your consciousness.
Says Nanak, meditate, and vibrate upon the Lord; this opportunity is slipping away! ||2||1||
Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:
The mind remains in the mind.
He does not meditate on the Lord, nor does he perform service at sacred shrines, and so death seizes him by the hair. ||1||Pause||
Wife, friends, children, carriages, property, total wealth, the entire world -
know that all of these things are false. The Lord's meditation alone is true. ||1||
Wandering, wandering around for so many ages, he has grown weary, and finally, he obtained this human body.
Says Nanak, this is the opportunity to meet the Lord; why don't you remember Him in meditation? ||2||2||
Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:
O mind, what evil-mindedness have you developed?
You are engrossed in the pleasures of other men's wives, and slander; you have not worshipped the Lord at all. ||1||Pause||
You do not know the way to liberation, but you run all around chasing wealth.
