Please bless me with the dust of the feet of Your slaves; Nanak is a sacrifice. ||4||3||33||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Keep me under Your Protection, God; shower me with Your Mercy.
I do not know how to serve You; I am just a low-life fool. ||1||
I take pride in You, O my Darling Beloved.
I am a sinner, continuously making mistakes; You are the Forgiving Lord. ||1||Pause||
I make mistakes each and every day. You are the Great Giver;
I am worthless. I associate with Maya, your hand-maiden, and I renounce You, God; such are my actions. ||2||
You bless me with everything, showering me with Mercy; And I am such an ungrateful wretch!
I am attached to Your gifts, but I do not even think of You, O my Lord and Master. ||3||
There is none other than You, O Lord, Destroyer of fear.
Says Nanak, I have come to Your Sanctuary, O Merciful Guru; I am so foolish - please, save me! ||4||4||34||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Don't blame anyone else; meditate on your God.
Serving Him, great peace is obtained; O mind, sing His Praises. ||1||
O Beloved, other than You, who else should I ask?
You are my Merciful Lord and Master; I am filled with all faults. ||1||Pause||
As You keep me, I remain; there is no other way.
You are the Support of the unsupported; You Name is my only Support. ||2||
One who accepts whatever You do as good - that mind is liberated.
The entire creation is Yours; all are subject to Your Ways. ||3||
I wash Your Feet and serve You, if it pleases You, O Lord and Master.
Be Merciful, O God of Compassion, that Nanak may sing Your Glorious Praises. ||4||5||35||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Death hovers over his head, laughing, but the beast does not understand.
Entangled in conflict, pleasure and egotism, he does not even think of death. ||1||
So serve your True Guru; why wander around miserable and unfortunate?
You gaze upon the transitory, beautiful safflower, but why do you get attached to it? ||1||Pause||
You commit sins again and again, to gather wealth to spend.
But your dust shall mix with dust; you shall arise and depart naked. ||2||
Those for whom you work, will become your spiteful enemies.
In the end, they will run away from you; why do you burn for them in anger? ||3||
He alone becomes the dust of the Lord's slaves, who has such good karma upon his forehead.
Says Nanak, he is released from bondage, in the Sanctuary of the True Guru. ||4||6||36||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
The cripple crosses over the mountain, the fool becomes a wise man,
and the blind man sees the three worlds, by meeting with the True Guru and being purified. ||1||
This is the Glory of the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; listen, O my friends.
Filth is washed away, millions of sins are dispelled, and the consciousness becomes immaculate and pure. ||1||Pause||
Such is devotional worship of the Lord of the Universe, that the ant can overpower the elephant.
Whoever the Lord makes His own, is blessed with the gift of fearlessness. ||2||
The lion becomes a cat, and the mountain looks like a blade of grass.
