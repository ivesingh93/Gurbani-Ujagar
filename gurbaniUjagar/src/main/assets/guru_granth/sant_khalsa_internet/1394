They do not suffer pain or hunger, and they cannot be called poor.
They do not grieve, and their limits cannot be found.
They do not serve anyone else, but they give gifts to hundreds and thousands.
They sit on beautiful carpets; they establish and disestablish at will.
They find peace in this world, and live fearlessly amidst their enemies.
They are fruitful and prosperous, says Jaalap. Guru Amar Daas is pleased with them. ||2||11||
You read about the One Lord, and enshrine Him in Your mind; You realize the One and Only Lord.
With Your eyes and the words You speak, You dwell upon the One Lord; You do not know any other place of rest.
You know the One Lord while dreaming, and the One Lord while awake. You are absorbed in the One.
At the age of seventy-one, You began to march towards the Indestructible Lord.
The One Lord, who takes hundreds of thousands of forms, cannot be seen. He can only be described as One.
So speaks Jaalap: O Guru Amar Daas, You long for the One Lord, and believe in the One Lord alone. ||3||12||
The understanding which Jai Dayv grasped, the understanding which permeated Naam Dayv,
the understanding which was in the consciousness of Trilochan and known by the devotee Kabeer,
by which RÃ¼kmaangad constantly meditated on the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny,
which brought Ambreek and Prahlaad to seek the Sanctuary of the Lord of the Universe, and which brought them to salvation -
says JALL that sublime understanding has brought You to renounce greed, anger and desire, and to know the way.
Guru Amar Daas is the Lord's own devotee; gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, one is liberated. ||4||13||
