Realizing the One Lord, love of duality ceases, and one comes to accept the Sublime Mantra of the Guru.
So speaks Jaalap: countless treasures are obtained, by the sight of Guru Amar Daas. ||5||14||
Guru Nanak gathered up the True Name of the Creator Lord, and implanted it within.
Through Him, Lehnaa became manifest in the form of Guru Angad, who remained lovingly attuned to His Feet.
Guru Amar Daas of that dynasty is the home of hope. How can I express His Glorious Virtues?
His Virtues are unknowable and unfathomable. I do not know the limits of His Virtues.
The Creator, the Architect of Destiny, has made Him a boat to carry all His generations across, along with the Sangat, the Holy Congregation.
So speaks Keerat: O Guru Amar Daas, please protect me and save me; I seek the Sanctuary of Your Feet. ||1||15||
The Lord Himself wielded His Power and entered the world.
The Formless Lord took form, and with His Light He illuminated the realms of the world.
He is All-pervading everywhere; the Lamp of the Shabad, the Word, has been lit.
Whoever gathers in the essence of the teachings shall be absorbed in the Feet of the Lord.
Lehnaa, who became Guru Angad, and Guru Amar Daas, have been reincarnated into the pure house of Guru Nanak.
Guru Amar Daas is our Saving Grace, who carries us across; in lifetime after lifetime, I seek the Sanctuary of Your Feet. ||2||16||
Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, the GurSikh is blessed with chanting and deep meditation, truth and contentment.
Whoever seeks His Sanctuary is saved; his account is cleared in the City of Death.
His heart is totally filled with loving devotion; he chants to the Creator Lord.
The Guru is the river of pearls; in an instant, he carries the drowning ones across.
He was reincarnated into the House of Guru Nanak; He chants the Glorious Praises of the Creator Lord.
Those who serve Guru Amar Daas - their pains and poverty are taken away, far away. ||3||17||
I consciously pray within my consciousness, but I cannot express it in words.
I place all my worries and anxieties before You; I look to the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, for help.
By the Hukam of Your Command, I am blessed with Your Insignia; I serve my Lord and Master.
When You, O Guru, gaze at me with Your Glance of Grace, the fruit of the Naam, the Name of the Creator, is placed within my mouth.
The Unfathomable and Unseen Primal Lord God, the Cause of causes - as He orders, so do I speak.
O Guru Amar Daas, Doer of deeds, Cause of causes, as You keep me, I remain; as You protect me, I survive. ||4||18||
Of Bhikhaa:
In deep meditation, and the spiritual wisdom of the Guru, one's essence merges with the essence of reality.
In truth, the True Lord is recognized and realized, when one is lovingly attuned to Him, with one-pointed consciousness.
Lust and anger are brought under control, when the breath does not fly around, wandering restlessly.
Dwelling in the land of the Formless Lord, realizing the Hukam of His Command, His contemplative wisdom is attained.
In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Guru is the Form of the Creator, the Primal Lord God; he alone knows, who has tried it.
So speaks Bhikhaa: I have met the Guru. With love and intuitive affection, He has bestowed the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. ||1||19||
I have been searching for the Saints; I have seen so many Holy and spiritual people.
The hermits, Sannyaasees, ascetics, penitents, fanatics and Pandits all speak sweetly.
I wandered around lost for a year, but no one touched my soul.
