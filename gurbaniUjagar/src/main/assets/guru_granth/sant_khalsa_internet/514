O Nanak, through the mind, the mind is satisfied, and then, nothing comes or goes. ||2||
Pauree:
The body is the fortress of the Infinite Lord; it is obtained only by destiny.
The Lord Himself dwells within the body; He Himself is the Enjoyer of pleasures.
He Himself remains detached and unaffected; while unattached, He is still attached.
He does whatever He pleases, and whatever He does, comes to pass.
The Gurmukh meditates on the Lord's Name, and separation from the Lord is ended. ||13||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Waaho! Waaho! The Lord Himself causes us to praise Him, through the True Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Waaho! Waaho! is His Eulogy and Praise; how rare are the Gurmukhs who understand this.
Waaho! Waaho! is the True Word of His Bani, by which we meet our True Lord.
O Nanak, chanting Waaho! Waaho! God is attained; by His Grace, He is obtained. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Chanting Waaho! Waaho! the tongue is adorned with the Word of the Shabad.
Through the Perfect Shabad, one comes to meet God.
How very fortunate are those, who with their mouths, chant Waaho! Waaho!
How beautiful are those persons who chant Waaho! Waaho!; people come to venerate them.
Waaho! Waaho! is obtained by His Grace; O Nanak, honor is obtained at the Gate of the True Lord. ||2||
Pauree:
Within the fortress of body, are the hard and rigid doors of falsehood, deception and pride.
Deluded by doubt, the blind and ignorant self-willed manmukhs cannot see them.
They cannot be found by any efforts; wearing their religious robes, the wearers have grown weary of trying.
The doors are opened only by the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and then, one chants the Name of the Lord.
The Dear Lord is the Tree of Ambrosial Nectar; those who drink in this Nectar are satisfied. ||14||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Chanting Waaho! Waaho! the night of one's life passes in peace.
Chanting Waaho! Waaho! I am in eternal bliss, O my mother!
Chanting Waaho! Waaho!, I have fallen in love with the Lord.
Waaho! Waaho! Through the karma of good deeds, I chant it, and inspire others to chant it as well.
Chanting Waaho! Waaho!, one obtains honor.
O Nanak, Waaho! Waaho! is the Will of the True Lord. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Waaho! Waaho! is the Bani of the True Word. Searching, the Gurmukhs have found it.
Waaho! Waaho! They chant the Word of the Shabad. Waaho! Waaho! They enshrine it in their hearts.
Chanting Waaho! Waaho! the Gurmukhs easily obtain the Lord, after searching.
O Nanak, very fortunate are those who reflect upon the Lord, Har, Har, within their hearts. ||2||
Pauree:
O my utterly greedy mind, you are constantly engrossed in greed.
In your desire for the enticing Maya, you wander in the ten directions.
Your name and social status shall not go with you hereafter; the self-willed manmukh is consumed by pain.
Your tongue does not taste the sublime essence of the Lord; it utters only insipid words.
Those Gurmukhs who drink in the Ambrosial Nectar are satisfied. ||15||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Chant Waaho! Waaho! to the Lord, who is True, profound and unfathomable.
Chant Waaho! Waaho! to the Lord, who is the Giver of virtue, intelligence and patience.
