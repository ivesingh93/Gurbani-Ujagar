When You brought me to the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, then I heard the Bani of Your Word.
Nanak is in ecstasy, beholding the Glory of the Primal Lord of Nirvaanaa. ||4||7||18||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
I am the dust of the feet of the Beloved Saints; I seek the Protection of their Sanctuary.
The Saints are my all-powerful Support; the Saints are my ornament and decoration. ||1||
I am hand and glove with the Saints.
I have realized my pre-ordained destiny.
This mind is yours, O Siblings of Destiny. ||Pause||
My dealings are with the Saints, and my business is with the Saints.
I have earned the profit with the Saints, and the treasure filled to over-flowing with devotion to the Lord. ||2||
The Saints entrusted to me the capital, and my mind's delusion was dispelled.
What can the Righteous Judge of Dharma do now? All my accounts have been torn up. ||3||
I have found the greatest bliss, and I am at peace, by the Grace of the Saints.
Says Nanak, my mind is reconciled with the Lord; it is imbued with the wondrous Love of the Lord. ||4||8||19||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
All the things that you see, O man, you shall have to leave behind.
Let your dealings be with the Lord's Name, and you shall attain the state of Nirvaanaa. ||1||
O my Beloved, You are the Giver of peace.
The Perfect Guru has given me these Teachings, and I am attuned to You. ||Pause||
In sexual desire, anger, greed, emotional attachment and self-conceit, peace is not to be found.
So be the dust of the feet of all, O my mind, and then you shall find bliss, joy and peace. ||2||
He knows the condition of your inner self, and He will not let your work go in vain - serve Him, O mind.
Worship Him, and dedicate this mind unto Him, the Image of the Undying Lord, the Divine Guru. ||3||
He is the Lord of the Universe, the Compassionate Lord, the Supreme Lord God, the Formless Lord.
The Naam is my merchandise, the Naam is my nourishment; the Naam, O Nanak, is the Support of my breath of life. ||4||9||20||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
He infuses the breath into the dead bodies, and he reunited the separated ones.
Even beasts, demons and fools become attentive listeners, when He sings the Praises of the Lord's Name. ||1||
Behold the glorious greatness of the Perfect Guru.
His worth cannot be described. ||Pause||
He has demolished the abode of sorrow and disease, and brought bliss, joy and happiness.
He effortlessly awards the fruits of the mind's desire, and all works are brought to perfection. ||2||
He finds peace in this world, and his face is radiant in the world hereafter; his comings and goings are finished.
He becomes fearless, and his heart is filled with the Naam, the Name of the Lord; his mind is pleasing to the True Guru. ||3||
Standing up and sitting down, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord; his pain, sorrow and doubt are dispelled.
Says Nanak, his karma is perfect; his mind is attached to the Guru's feet. ||4||10||21||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
Forsaking the jewel, he is attached to the shell; nothing will come of it.
