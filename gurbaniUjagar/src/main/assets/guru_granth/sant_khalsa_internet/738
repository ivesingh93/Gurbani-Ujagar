I cannot survive, even for an instant, without the feet of my Beloved.
When God becomes Merciful, I become fortunate, and then I meet Him. ||3||
Becoming Merciful, He has united me with the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation.
The fire has been quenched, and I have found my Husband Lord within my own home.
I am now adorned with all sorts of decorations.
Says Nanak, the Guru has dispelled my doubt. ||4||
Wherever I look, I see my Husband Lord there, O Siblings of Destiny.
When the door is opened, then the mind is restrained. ||1||Second Pause||5||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
What virtues and excellences of Yours should I cherish and contemplate? I am worthless, while You are the Great Giver.
I am Your slave - what clever tricks could I ever try? This soul and body are totally Yours||1||
O my Darling, Blissful Beloved, who fascinates my mind - I am a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. ||1||Pause||
O God, You are the Great Giver, and I am just a poor beggar; You are forever and ever benevolent.
I cannot accomplish anything by myself, O my Unapproachable and Infinite Lord and Master. ||2||
What service can I perform? What should I say to please You? How can I gain the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan?
Your extent cannot be found - Your limits cannot be found. My mind longs for Your Feet. ||3||
I beg with persistence to receive this gift, that the dust of the Saints might touch my face.
The Guru has showered His Mercy upon servant Nanak; reaching out with His Hand, God has delivered him. ||4||6||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl, Third House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
His service is insignificant, but his demands are very great.
He does not obtain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, but he says that he has arrived there||1||
He competes with those who have been accepted by the Beloved Lord.
This is how stubborn the false fool is! ||1||Pause||
He wears religious robes, but he does not practice Truth.
He says that he has found the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, but he cannot even get near it. ||2||
He says that he is unattached, but he is intoxicated with Maya.
There is no love in his mind, and yet he says that he is imbued with the Lord. ||3||
Says Nanak, hear my prayer, God:
I am silly, stubborn and filled with sexual desire - please, liberate me! ||4||
I gaze upon the glorious greatness of the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.
You are the Giver of Peace, the Loving Primal Being. ||1||Second Pause||1||7||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
He gets up early, to do his evil deeds,
but when it is time to meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, then he sleeps. ||1||
The ignorant person does not take advantage of the opportunity.
He is attached to Maya, and engrossed in worldly delights. ||1||Pause||
He rides the waves of greed, puffed up with joy.
He does not see the Blessed Vision of the Darshan of the Holy. ||2||
The ignorant clown will never understand.
Again and again, he becomes engrossed in entanglements. ||1||Pause||
He listens to the sounds of sin and the music of corruption, and he is pleased.
His mind is too lazy to listen to the Praises of the Lord. ||3||
You do not see with your eyes - you are so blind!
You shall have to leave all these false affairs. ||1||Pause||
Says Nanak, please forgive me, God.
