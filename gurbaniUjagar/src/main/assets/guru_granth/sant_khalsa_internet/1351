He Himself is the Commander; all are under His Command. The Fearless Lord looks on all alike. ||3||
That humble being who knows, and meditates on the Supreme Primal Being - his word becomes eternal.
Says Naam Dayv, I have found the Invisible, Wondrous Lord, the Life of the World, within my heart. ||4||1||
Prabhaatee:
He existed in the beginning, in the primeval age, and all throughout the ages; His limits cannot be known.
The Lord is pervading and permeating amongst all; this is how His Form can be described. ||1||
The Lord of the Universe appears when the Word of His Shabad is chanted.
My Lord is the Embodiment of Bliss. ||1||Pause||
The beautiful fragrance of sandalwood emanates from the sandalwood tree, and attaches to the other trees of the forest.
God, the Primal Source of everything, is like the sandalwood tree; He transforms us woody trees into fragrant sandalwood. ||2||
You, O Lord, are the Philosopher's Stone, and I am iron; associating with You, I am transformed into gold.
You are Merciful; You are the gem and the jewel. Naam Dayv is absorbed in the Truth. ||3||2||
Prabhaatee:
The Primal Being has no ancestry; He has staged this play.
God is hidden deep within each and every heart. ||1||
No one knows the Light of the soul.
Whatever I do, is known to You, Lord. ||1||Pause||
Just as the pitcher is made from clay,
everything is made from the Beloved Divine Creator Himself. ||2||
The mortal's actions hold the soul in the bondage of karma.
Whatever he does, he does on his own. ||3||
Prays Naam Dayv, whatever this soul wants, it obtains.
Whoever abides in the Lord, becomes immortal. ||4||3||
Prabhaatee, The Word Of Devotee Baynee Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
You rub your body with sandalwood oil, and place basil leaves on your forehead.
But you hold a knife in the hand of your heart.
You look like a thug; pretending to meditate, you pose like a crane.
You try to look like a Vaishnaav, but the breath of life escapes through your mouth. ||1||
You pray for hours to God the Beautiful.
But your gaze is evil, and your nights are wasted in conflict. ||1||Pause||
You perform daily cleansing rituals,
wear two loin-cloths, perform religious rituals and put only milk in your mouth.
But in your heart, you have drawn out the sword.
You routinely steal the property of others. ||2||
You worship the stone idol, and paint ceremonial marks of Ganesha.
You remain awake throughout the night, pretending to worship God.
You dance, but your consciousness is filled with evil.
You are lewd and depraved - this is such an unrighteous dance! ||3||
You sit on a deer-skin, and chant on your mala.
You put the sacred mark, the tilak, on your forehead.
You wear the rosary beads of Shiva around your neck, but your heart is filled with falsehood.
You are lewd and depraved - you do not chant God's Name. ||4||
Whoever does not realize the essence of the soul -
all his religious actions are hollow and false.
Says Baynee, as Gurmukh, meditate.
Without the True Guru, you shall not find the Way. ||5||1||
