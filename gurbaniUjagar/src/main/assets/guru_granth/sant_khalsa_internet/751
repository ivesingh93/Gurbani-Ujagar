Soohee, First Mehl, Ninth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The color of safflower is transitory; it lasts for only a few days.
Without the Name, the false woman is deluded by doubt and plundered by thieves.
But those who are attuned to the True Lord, are not reincarnated again. ||1||
How can one who is already dyed in the color of the Lord's Love, be colored any other color?
So serve God the Dyer, and focus your consciousness on the True Lord. ||1||Pause||
You wander around in the four directions, but without the good fortune of destiny, you shall never obtain wealth.
If you are plundered by corruption and vice, you shall wander around, but like a fugitive, you shall find no place of rest.
Only those who are protected by the Guru are saved; their minds are attuned to the Word of the Shabad. ||2||
Those who wear white clothes, but have filthy and stone-hearted minds,
may chant the Lord's Name with their mouths, but they are engrossed in duality; they are thieves.
They do not understand their own roots; they are beasts. They are just animals! ||3||
Constantly, continually, the mortal seeks pleasures. Constantly, continually, he begs for peace.
But he does not think of the Creator Lord, and so he is overtaken by pain, again and again.
But one, within whose mind the Giver of pleasure and pain dwells - how can his body feel any need? ||4||
One who has a karmic debt to pay off is summoned, and the Messenger of Death smashes his head.
When his account is called for, it has to be given. After it is reviewed, payment is demanded.
Only love for the True One will save you; the Forgiver forgives. ||5||
If you make any friend other than God, you shall dIE and mingle with the dust.
Gazing upon the many games of love, you are beguiled and bewildered; you come and go in reincarnation.
Only by God's Grace can you be saved. By His Grace, He unites in His Union. ||6||
O careless one, you are totally lacking any wisdom; do not seek wisdom without the Guru.
By indecision and inner conflict, you shall come to ruin. Good and bad both pull at you.
Without being attuned to the Word of the Shabad and the Fear of God, all come under the gaze of the Messenger of Death. ||7||
He who created the creation and sustains it, gives sustenance to all.
How can you forget Him from your mind? He is the Great Giver, forever and ever.
Nanak shall never forget the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the Support of the unsupported. ||8||1||2||

One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
This human birth is so difficult to obtain; the Gurmukh obtains it.
The mind and body are dyed in the deep red color of devotional love, if it pleases the True Guru. ||1||
He departs with his life embellished and successful, taking the merchandise of the True Name.
He is honored in the Darbaar, the Royal Court, of the Lord, through the Shabad, the Word of the True Guru, and the Fear of God. ||1||Pause||
One who praises the True Lord with his mind and body, pleases the Mind of the True Lord.
