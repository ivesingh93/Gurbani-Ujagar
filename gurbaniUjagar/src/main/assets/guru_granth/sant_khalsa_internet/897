I humbly pray to invoke the Universal Lord God, the Lord of the World.
The Creator Lord is all-pervading, everywhere. ||1||Pause||
He is the Lord of the Universe, the Life of the World.
Within your heart, worship and adore the Destroyer of fear.
The Master Rishi of the senses, Lord of the World, Lord of the Universe.
He is perfect, ever-present everywhere, the Liberator. ||2||
You are the One and only merciful Master,
spiritual teacher, prophet, religious teacher.
Master of hearts, Dispenser of justice,
more sacred than the Koran and the Bible. ||3||
The Lord is powerful and merciful.
The all-pervading Lord is the support of each and every heart.
The luminous Lord dwells everywhere.
His play cannot be known. ||4||
Be kind and compassionate to me, O Creator Lord.
Bless me with devotion and meditation, O Lord Creator.
Says Nanak, the Guru has rid me of doubt.
The Muslim God Allah and the Hindu God Paarbrahm are one and the same. ||5||34||45||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
The sins of millions of incarnations are eradicated.
Meditating on the Lord, Har, Har, pain will not afflict you.
When the Lord's lotus feet are enshrined in the mind,
all terrible evils are taken away from the body. ||1||
Sing the Praise of the Lord of the World, O mortal being.
The Unspoken Speech of the True Lord God is perfect. Dwelling upon it, one's light merges into the Light. ||1||Pause||
Hunger and thirst are totally quenched;
by the Grace of the Saints, meditate on the immortal Lord.
Night and day, serve God.
This is the sign that one has met with the Lord. ||2||
Worldly entanglements are ended, when God becomes merciful.
Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan, I am enraptured.
My perfect pre-destined karma has been activated.
With my tongue, I continually sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||3||
The Saints of the Lord are accepted and approved forever.
The foreheads of the Saintly people are marked with the Lord's insignia.
One who is blessed with the dust of the feet of the Lord's slave,
O Nanak, obtains the supreme status. ||4||35||46||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
Let yourself be a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan.
Focus your heart's meditation on the Lord's lotus feet.
Apply the dust of the feet of the Saints to your forehead,
and the filthy evil-mindedness of countless incarnations will be washed off. ||1||
Meeting Him, egotistical pride is eradicated,
and you will come to see the Supreme Lord God in all. The Perfect Lord God has showered His Mercy. ||1||Pause||
This is the Guru's Praise, to chant the Name of the Lord.
This is devotion to the Guru, to sing forever the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
This is contemplation upon the Guru, to know that the Lord is close at hand.
Accept the Word of the Guru's Shabad as Truth. ||2||
Through the Word of the Guru's Teachings, look upon pleasure and pain as one and the same.
Hunger and thirst shall never afflict you.
The mind becomes content and satisfied through the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Meditate on the Lord of the Universe, and He will cover all your faults. ||3||
The Guru is the Supreme Lord God; the Guru is the Lord of the Universe.
The Guru is the Great Giver, merciful and forgiving.
One whose mind is attached to the Guru's feet,
O slave Nanak, is blessed with perfect destiny. ||4||36||47||
