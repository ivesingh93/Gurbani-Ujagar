Fifth Mehl:
The miserable endure so much suffering and pain; You alone know their pain, Lord.
I may know hundreds of thousands of remedies, but I shall live only if I see my Husband Lord. ||2||
Fifth Mehl:
I have seen the river-bank washed away by the raging waters of the river.
They alone remain intact, who meet with the True Guru. ||3||
Pauree:
No pain afflicts that humble being who hungers for You, Lord.
That humble Gurmukh who understands, is celebrated in the four directions.
Sins run away from that man, who seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord.
The filth of countless incarnations is washed away, bathing in the dust of the Guru's feet.
Whoever submits to the Lord's Will does not suffer in sorrow.
O Dear Lord, You are the friend of all; all believe that You are theirs.
The glory of the Lord's humble servant is as great as the Glorious Radiance of the Lord.
Among all, His humble servant is pre-eminent; through His humble servant, the Lord is known. ||8||
Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:
Those whom I followed, now follow me.
Those in whom I placed my hopes, now place their hopes in me. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
The fly flies around, and comes to the wet lump of molasses.
Whoever sits on it, is caught; they alone are saved, who have good destiny on their foreheads. ||2||
Fifth Mehl:
I see Him within all. No one is without Him.
Good destiny is inscribed on the forehead of that companion, who enjoys the Lord, my Friend. ||3||
Pauree:
I am a minstrel at His Door, singing His Glorious Praises, to please to my Lord God.
My God is permanent and stable; others continue coming and going.
I beg for that gift from the Lord of the World, which will satisfy my hunger.
O Dear Lord God, please bless Your minstrel with the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, that I might be satisfied and fulfilled.
God, the Great Giver, hears the prayer, and summons the minstrel to the Mansion of His Presence.
Gazing upon God, the minstrel is rid of pain and hunger; he does not think to ask for anything else.
All desires are fulfilled, touching the feet of God.
I am His humble, unworthy minstrel; the Primal Lord God has forgiven me. ||9||
Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:
When the soul leaves, you shall become dust, O vacant body; why do you not realize your Husband Lord?
You are in love with evil people; by what virtues will you enjoy the Lord's Love? ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
O Nanak, without Him, you cannot survive, even for an instant; you cannot afford to forget Him, even for a moment.
Why are you alienated from Him, O my mind? He takes care of you. ||2||
Fifth Mehl:
Those who are imbued with the Love of the Supreme Lord God, their minds and bodies are colored deep crimson.
O Nanak, without the Name, other thoughts are polluted and corrupt. ||3||
Pauree:
O Dear Lord, when You are my friend, what sorrow can afflict me?
You have beaten off and destroyed the cheats that cheat the world.
The Guru has carried me across the terrifying world-ocean, and I have won the battle.
Through the Guru's Teachings, I enjoy all the pleasures in the great world-arena.
The True Lord has brought all my senses and organs under my control.
