Grabbing them by the hair on their heads, the Lord throws them down, and leaves them on the path of Death.
They cry out in pain, in the darkest of hells.
But hugging His slaves close to His Heart, O Nanak, the True Lord saves them. ||20||
Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
Meditate on the Lord, O fortunate ones; He is pervading the waters and the earth.
O Nanak, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and no misfortune shall strike you. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
Millions of misfortunes block the way of one who forgets the Name of the Lord.
O Nanak, like a crow in a deserted house, he cries out, night and day. ||2||
Pauree:
Meditating, meditating in remembrance of the Great Giver, one's heart's desires are fulfilled.
The hopes and desires of the mind are realized, and sorrows are forgotten.
The treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is obtained; I have searched for it for so long.
My light is merged into the Light, and my labors are over.
I abide in that house of peace, poise and bliss.
My comings and goings have ended - there is no birth or death there.
The Master and the servant have become one, with no sense of separation.
By Guru's Grace, Nanak is absorbed in the True Lord. ||21||1||2||Sudh||
Raag Goojaree, The Words Of The Devotees:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Chau-Padas Of Kabeer Jee, Second House:
With four feet, two horns and a mute mouth, how could you sing the Praises of the Lord?
Standing up and sitting down, the stick shall still fall on you, so where will you hide your head? ||1||
Without the Lord, you are like a stray ox;
with your nose torn, and your shoulders injured, you shall have only the straw of coarse grain to eat. ||1||Pause||
All day long, you shall wander in the forest, and even then, your belly will not be full.
You did not follow the advice of the humble devotees, and so you shall obtain the fruits of your actions. ||2||
Enduring pleasure and pain, drowned in the great ocean of doubt, you shall wander in numerous reincarnations.
You have lost the jewel of human birth by forgetting God; when will you have such an opportunity again? ||3||
You turn on the wheel of reincarnation, like an ox at the oil-press; the night of your life passes away without salvation.
Says Kabeer, without the Name of the Lord, you shall pound your head, and regret and repent. ||4||1||
Goojaree, Third House:
Kabeer's mother sobs, cries and bewails -
O Lord, how will my grandchildren live? ||1||
Kabeer has given up all his spinning and weaving,
and written the Name of the Lord on his body. ||1||Pause||
As long as I pass the thread through the bobbin,
I forget the Lord, my Beloved. ||2||
My intellect is lowly - I am a weaver by birth,
but I have earned the profit of the Name of the Lord. ||3||
Says Kabeer, listen, O my mother -
the Lord alone is the Provider, for me and my children. ||4||2||
