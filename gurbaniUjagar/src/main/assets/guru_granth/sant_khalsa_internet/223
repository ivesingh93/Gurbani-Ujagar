I have consulted the Guru, and I have seen that there is no other door than His.
Pain and pleasure reside in the Pleasure of His Will and His Command.
Nanak, the lowly, says embrace love for the Lord. ||8||4||
Gauree, First Mehl:
The duality of Maya dwells in the consciousness of the people of the world.
They are destroyed by sexual desire, anger and egotism. ||1||
Whom should I call the second, when there is only the One?
The One Immaculate Lord is pervading among all. ||1||Pause||
The dual-minded evil intellect speaks of a second.
One who harbors duality comes and goes and dies. ||2||
In the earth and in the sky, I do not see any second.
Among all the women and the men, His Light is shining. ||3||
In the lamps of the sun and the moon, I see His Light.
Dwelling among all is my ever-youthful Beloved. ||4||
In His Mercy, He attuned my consciousness to the Lord.
The True Guru has led me to understand the One Lord. ||5||
The Gurmukh knows the One Immaculate Lord.
Subduing duality, one comes to realize the Word of the Shabad. ||6||
The Command of the One Lord prevails throughout all the worlds.
From the One, all have arisen. ||7||
There are two routes, but remember that their Lord and Master is only One.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, recognize the Hukam of the Lord's Command. ||8||
He is contained in all forms, colors and minds.
Says Nanak, praise the One Lord. ||9||5||
Gauree, First Mehl:
Those who live a spiritual lifestyle - they alone are true.
What can the false know about the secrets of liberation? ||1||
Those who contemplate the Way are Yogis.
They conquer the five thieves, and enshrine the True Lord in the heart. ||1||Pause||
Those who enshrine the True Lord deep within,
realize the value of the Way of Yoga. ||2||
The sun and the moon are one and the same for them, as are household and wilderness.
The karma of their daily practice is to praise the Lord. ||3||
They beg for the alms of the one and only Shabad.
They remain awake and aware in spiritual wisdom and meditation, and the true way of life. ||4||
They remain absorbed in the fear of God; they never leave it.
Who can estimate their value? They remain lovingly absorbed in the Lord. ||5||
The Lord unites them with Himself, dispelling their doubts.
By Guru's Grace, the supreme status is obtained. ||6||
In the Guru's service is reflection upon the Shabad.
Subduing ego, practice pure actions. ||7||
Chanting, meditation, austere self-discipline and the reading of the Puraanas,
says Nanak, are contained in surrender to the Unlimited Lord. ||8||6||
Gauree, First Mehl:
To practice forgiveness is the true fast, good conduct and contentment.
Disease does not afflict me, nor does the pain of death.
I am liberated, and absorbed into God, who has no form or feature. ||1||
What fear does the Yogi have?
The Lord is among the trees and the plants, within the household and outside as well. ||1||Pause||
The Yogis meditate on the Fearless, Immaculate Lord.
Night and day, they remain awake and aware, embracing love for the True Lord.
Those Yogis are pleasing to my mind. ||2||
The trap of death is burnt by the Fire of God.
Old age, death and pride are conquered.
They swim across, and save their ancestors as well. ||3||
Those who serve the True Guru are the Yogis.
Those who remain immersed in the Fear of God become fearless.
They become just like the One they serve. ||4||
