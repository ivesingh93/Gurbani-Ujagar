If you hear the Naam, the Name of the Lord, you feel like you have been stung by a scorpion. ||2||
You continually yearn for Maya,
and you never chant the Lord's Praises with your mouth.
The Lord is fearless and formless; He is the Great Giver.
But you do not love Him, you fool! ||3||
God, the True King, is above the heads of all kings.
He is the independent, perfect Lord King.
People are intoxicated by emotional attachment, entangled in doubt and family life.
Nanak: they are saved only by Your Mercy, Lord. ||4||21||32||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
Night and day, I chant the Lord's Name.
Hereafter, I shall obtain a seat in the Court of the Lord.
I am in bliss forever; I have no sorrow.
The disease of ego never afflicts me. ||1||
O Saints of the Lord, seek out those who know God.
You shall be wonderstruck with wonder at the wonderful Lord; meditate in remembrance on the Lord, O mortal, and obtain the supreme status. ||1||Pause||
Calculating, measuring, and thinking in every way,
see that without the Naam, no one can be carried across.
Of all your efforts, none will go along with you.
You can cross over the terrifying world-ocean only through the love of God. ||2||
By merely washing the body, one's filth is not removed.
Afflicted by egotism, duality only increases.
That humble being who takes the medicine of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har -
all his diseases are eradicated. ||3||
Take pity on me, O merciful, Supreme Lord God;
let me never forget the Lord of the World from my mind.
Let me be the dust of the feet of Your slaves;
O God, please fulfill Nanak's hope. ||4||22||33||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
You are my Protection, O perfect Divine Guru.
There is no other than You.
You are all-powerful, O perfect Supreme Lord God.
He alone meditates on You, whose karma is perfect. ||1||
You Name, God, is the boat to carry us across.
My mind has grasped Your protection alone. Other than You, I have no place of rest at all. ||1||Pause||
Chanting, meditating on Your Name, I live,
and hereafter, I will obtain a seat in the Court of the Lord.
Pain and darkness are gone from my mind;
my evil-mindedness is dispelled, and I am absorbed in the Lord's Name. ||2||
I have enshrined love for the Lord's lotus feet.
The lifestyle of the Perfect Guru is immaculate and pure.
My fear has run away, and the fearless Lord dwells within my mind.
My tongue continually chants the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||3||
The nooses of millions of incarnations are cut away.
I have obtained the profit of the true wealth.
This treasure is inexhaustible; it will never run out.
O Nanak, the devotees look beautiful in the Court of the Lord. ||4||23||34||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is a jewel, a ruby.
It brings Truth, contentment and spiritual wisdom.
The Lord entrusts the treasures of peace,
intuition and kindness to His devotees. ||1||
This is the treasure of my Lord.
Consuming and expending it, it is never used up. The Lord has no end or limitation. ||1||Pause||
The Kirtan of the Lord's Praise is a priceless diamond.
It is the ocean of bliss and virtue.
In the Word of the Guru's Bani is the wealth of the unstruck sound current.
The Saints hold the key to it in their hands. ||2||
