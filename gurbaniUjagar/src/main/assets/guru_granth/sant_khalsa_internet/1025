Wandering from the Name, he endures beatings.
Even great cleverness does not dispel doubt.
The unconscious fool does not remain conscious of the Lord; he putrefies and rots away to death, carrying his heavy load of sin. ||8||
No one is free of conflict and strife.
Show me anyone who is, and I will praise him.
Dedicating mind and body to God, one meets the Lord, the Life of the World, and becomes just like Him. ||9||
No one knows the state and extent of God.
Whoever calls himself great, will be eaten by his greatness.
There is no lack of gifts of our True Lord and Master. He created all. ||10||
Great is the glorious greatness of the independent Lord.
He Himself created, and gives sustenance to all.
The Merciful Lord is not far away; the Great Giver spontaneously unites with Himself, by His Will. ||11||
Some are sad, and some are afflicted with disease.
Whatever God does, He does by Himself.
Through loving devotion, and the Perfect Teachings of the Guru, the unstruck sound current of the Shabad is realized. ||12||
Some wander and roam around, hungry and naked.
Some act in stubbornness and die, but do not know the value of God.
They do not know the difference between good and bad; this is understood only through the practice of the Word of the Shabad. ||13||
Some bathe at sacred shrines and refuse to eat.
Some torment their bodies in burning fire.
Without the Lord's Name, liberation is not obtained; how can anyone cross over? ||14||
Abandoning the Guru's Teachings, some wander in the wilderness.
The self-willed manmukhs are destitute; they do not meditate on the Lord.
They are ruined, destroyed and drowned from practicing falsehood; death is the enemy of the false. ||15||
By the Hukam of the Lord's Command, they come, and by the Hukam of His Command, they go.
One who realizes His Hukam, merges in the True Lord.
O Nanak, he merges in the True Lord, and his mind is pleased with the Lord. The Gurmukhs do His work. ||16||5||
Maaroo, First Mehl:
He Himself is the Creator Lord, the Architect of Destiny.
He evaluates those whom He Himself has created.
He Himself is the True Guru, and He Himself is the servant; He Himself created the Universe. ||1||
He is near at hand, not far away.
The Gurmukhs understand Him; perfect are those humble beings.
Associating with them night and day is profitable. This is the glorious greatness of associating with the Guru. ||2||
Throughout the ages, Your Saints are holy and sublime, O God.
They sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, savoring it with their tongues.
They chant His Praises, and their pain and poverty are taken away; they are not afraid of anyone else. ||3||
They remain awake and aware, and do not appear to sleep.
They serve up Truth, and so save their companions and relatives.
They are not stained with the filth of sins; they are immaculate and pure, and remain absorbed in loving devotional worship. ||4||
O humble servants of the Lord, understand the Word of the Guru's Bani.
This youth, breath and body shall pass away.
O mortal, you shall die today or tomorrow; chant, and meditate on the Lord within your heart. ||5||
O mortal, abandon falsehood and your worthless ways.
Death viciously kills the false beings.
The faithless cynic is ruined through falsehood and his egotistical mind. On the path of duality, he rots away and decomposes. ||6||
