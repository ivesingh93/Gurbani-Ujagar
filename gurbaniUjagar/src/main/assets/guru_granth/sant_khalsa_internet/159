The fools perform devotional worship by showing off;
they dance and dance and jump all around, but they only suffer in terrible pain.
By dancing and jumping, devotional worship is not performed.
But one who dies in the Word of the Shabad, obtains devotional worship. ||3||
The Lord is the Lover of His devotees; He inspires them to perform devotional worship.
True devotional worship consists of eliminating selfishness and conceit from within.
My True God knows all ways and means.
O Nanak, He forgives those who recognize the Naam. ||4||4||24||
Gauree Gwaarayree, Third Mehl:
When someone kills and subdues his own mind, his wandering nature is also subdued.
Without such a death, how can one find the Lord?
Only a few know the medicine to kill the mind.
One whose mind dies in the Word of the Shabad, understands Him. ||1||
He grants greatness to those whom He forgives.
By Guru's Grace, the Lord comes to dwell within the mind. ||1||Pause||
The Gurmukh practices doing good deeds;
thus he comes to understand this mind.
The mind is like an elephant, drunk with wine.
The Guru is the rod which controls it, and shows it the way. ||2||
The mind is uncontrollable; how rare are those who subdue it.
Those who control the difficult mind become pure.
The Gurmukhs embellish and beautify this mind.
They eradicate egotism and corruption from within. ||3||
Those who, by pre-ordained destiny, are united in the Lord's Union,
are never separated from Him again; they are absorbed in the Shabad.
He Himself knows His Own Almighty Power.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh realizes the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||5||25||
Gauree Gwaarayree, Third Mehl:
The entire world has gone insane in egotism.
In the love of duality, it wanders deluded by doubt.
The mind is distracted by great anxiety; no one recognizes one's own self.
Occupied with their own affairs, their nights and days are passing away. ||1||
Meditate on the Lord in your hearts, O my Siblings of Destiny.
The Gurmukh's tongue savors the sublime essence of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
The Gurmukhs recognize the Lord in their own hearts;
they serve the Lord, the Life of the World. They are famous throughout the four ages.
They subdue egotism, and realize the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
God, the Architect of Destiny, showers His Mercy upon them. ||2||
True are those who merge into the Word of the Guru's Shabad;
they restrain their wandering mind and keep it steady.
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the nine treasures. It is obtained from the Guru.
By the Lord's Grace, the Lord comes to dwell in the mind. ||3||
Chanting the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam, the body becomes peaceful and tranquil.
He dwells deep within - the pain of death does not touch Him.
He Himself is our Lord and Master; He is His Own Advisor.
O Nanak, serve the Lord forever; He is the treasure of glorious virtue. ||4||6||26||
Gauree Gwaarayree, Third Mehl:
Why forget Him, unto whom the soul and the breath of life belong?
Why forget Him, who is all-pervading?
Serving Him, one is honored and accepted in the Court of the Lord. ||1||
I am a sacrifice to the Name of the Lord.
If I were to forget You, at that very instant, I would die. ||1||Pause||
Those whom You Yourself have led astray, forget You.
