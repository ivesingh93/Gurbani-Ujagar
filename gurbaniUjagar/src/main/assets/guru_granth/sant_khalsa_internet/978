Meeting with the Lord, you be enraptured. ||1||Pause||
The Guru, the Saint, has shown me the Lord's Path. The Guru has shown me the way to walk on the Lord's Path.
Cast out deception from within yourself, O my GurSikhs, and without deception, serve the Lord. You shall be enraptured, enraptured, enraptured. ||1||
Those Sikhs of the Guru, who realize that my Lord God is with them, are pleasing to my Lord God.
The Lord God has blessed servant Nanak with understanding; seeing his Lord hear at hand, his is enraptured, enraptured, enraptured, enraptured. ||2||3||9||
Raag Nat Naaraayan, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O Lord, how can I know what pleases You?
Within my mind is such a great thirst for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. ||1||Pause||
He alone is a spiritual teacher, and he alone is Your humble servant, to whom You have given Your approval.
He alone meditates on You forever and ever, O Primal Lord, O Architect of Destiny, unto whom You grant Your Grace. ||1||
What sort of Yoga, what spiritual wisdom and meditation, and what virtues please You?
He alone is a humble servant, and he alone is God's own devotee, with whom You are in love. ||2||
That alone is intelligence, that alone is wisdom and cleverness, which inspires one to never forget God, even for an instant.
Joining the Society of the Saints, I have found this peace, singing forever the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||3||
I have seen the Wondrous Lord, the embodiment of supreme bliss, and now, I see nothing else at all.
Says Nanak, the Guru has rubbed sway the rust; now how could I ever enter the womb of reincarnation again? ||4||1||
Raag Nat Naaraayan, Fifth Mehl, Du-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
I don't blame anyone else.
Whatever You do is sweet to my mind. ||1||Pause||
Understanding and obeying Your Order, I have found peace; hearing, listening to Your Name, I live.
Here and hereafter, O Lord, You, only You. The Guru has implanted this Mantra within me. ||1||
Since I came to realize this, I have been blessed with total peace and pleasure.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, this has been revealed to Nanak, and now, there is no other for him at all. ||2||1||2||
Nat, Fifth Mehl:
Whoever has You for support,
has the fear of death removed; peace is found, and the disease of egotism is taken away. ||1||Pause||
The fire within is quenched, and one is satisfied through the Ambrosial Word of the Guru's Bani, as the baby is satisfied by milk.
The Saints are my mother, father and friends. The Saints are my help and support, and my brothers. ||1||
