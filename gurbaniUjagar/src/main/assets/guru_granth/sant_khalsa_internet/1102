He has blessed me with the capital, the wealth of spiritual wisdom; He has made me worthy of this merchandise.
He has made me a partner with the Guru; I have obtained all peace and comforts.
He is with me, and shall never separate from me; the Lord, my father, is potent to do everything. ||21||
Shalok, Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:
O Nanak, break away from the false, and seek out the Saints, your true friends.
The false shall leave you, even while you are still alive; but the Saints shall not forsake you, even when you are dead. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
O Nanak, the lightning flashes, and thunder echoes in the dark black clouds.
The downpour from the clouds is heavy; O Nanak, the soul-brides are exalted and embellished with their Beloved. ||2||
Fifth Mehl:
The ponds and the lands are overflowing with water, and the cold wind is blowing.
Her bed is adorned with gold, diamonds and rubies;
she is blessed with beautiful gowns and delicacies, O Nanak, but without her Beloved, she burns in agony. ||3||
Pauree:
He does the deeds which the Creator causes him to do.
Even if you run in hundreds of directions, O mortal, you shall still receive what you are pre-destined to receive.
Without good karma, you shall obtain nothing, even if you wander across the whole world.
Meeting with the Guru, you shall know the Fear of God, and other fears shall be taken away.
Through the Fear of God, the attitude of detachment wells up, and one sets out in search of the Lord.
Searching and searching, intuitive wisdom wells up, and then, one is not born to dIE again.
Practicing meditation within my heart, I have found the Sanctuary of the Holy.
Whoever the Lord places on the boat of Guru Nanak, is carried across the terrifying world-ocean. ||22||
Shalok, Dakhanay Fifth Mehl:
First, accept death, and give up any hope of life.
Become the dust of the feet of all, and then, you may come to me. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
See, that only one who has died, truly lives; one who is alive, consider him dead.
Those who are in love with the One Lord, are the supreme people. ||2||
Fifth Mehl:
Pain does not even approach that person, within whose mind God abides.
Hunger and thirst do not affect him, and the Messenger of Death does not approach him. ||3||
Pauree:
Your worth cannot be estimated, O True, Unmoving Lord God.
The Siddhas, seekers, spiritual teachers and meditators - who among them can measure You?
You are all-powerful, to form and break; You create and destroy all.
You are all-powerful to act, and inspire all to act; You speak through each and every heart.
You give sustenance to all; why should mankind waver?
You are deep, profound and unfathomable; Your virtuous spiritual wisdom is priceless.
They do the deeds which they are pre-ordained to do.
Without You, there is nothing at all; Nanak chants Your Glorious Praises. ||23||1||2||
Raag Maaroo, The Word Of Kabeer Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O Pandit, O religious scholar, in what foul thoughts are you engaged?
You shall be drowned, along with your family, if you do not meditate on the Lord, you unfortunate person. ||1||Pause||
What is the use of reading the Vedas and the Puraanas? It is like loading a donkey with sandalwood.
