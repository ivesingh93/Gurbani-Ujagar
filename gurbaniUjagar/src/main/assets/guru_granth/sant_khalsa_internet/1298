Your humble servants focus their consciousness and meditate on You with one-pointed mind; those Holy beings find peace, chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, the Treasure of Bliss.
They sing Your Praises, God, meeting with the Holy, the Holy people, and the Guru, the True Guru, O Lord God. ||1||
They alone obtain the fruit of peace, within whose hearts You, O my Lord and Master, abide. They cross over the terrifying world-ocean - they are known as the Lord's devotees.
Please enjoin me to their service, Lord, please enjoin me to their service. O Lord God, You, You, You, You, You are the Lord of servant Nanak. ||2||6||12||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the World, the Treasure of Mercy.
The True Guru is the Destroyer of pain, the Giver of peace; meeting Him, one is totally fulfilled. ||1||Pause||
Meditate in remembrance on the Naam, the Support of the mind.
Millions of sinners are carried across in an instant. ||1||
Whoever remembers his Guru,
shall not suffer sorrow, even in dreams. ||2||
Whoever keeps his Guru enshrined within
- that humble being tastes the sublime essence of the Lord with his tongue. ||3||
Says Nanak, the Guru has been Kind to me;
here and hereafter, my face is radiant. ||4||1||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
I worship and adore You, my Lord and Master.
Standing up and sitting down, while sleeping and awake, with each and every breath, I meditate on the Lord. ||1||Pause||
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides within the hearts of those,
whose Lord and Master blesses them with this gift. ||1||
Peace and tranquility come into the hearts of those
who meet their Lord and Master, through the Word of the Guru. ||2||
Those are wise and blessed with all powers,
whom the Guru blesses with the Mantra of the Naam. ||3||
Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to those
who are blessed with the Name in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga. ||4||2||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
Sing the Praises of God, O my tongue.
Humbly bow to the Saints, over and over again; through them, the Feet of the Lord of the Universe shall come to abide within you. ||1||Pause||
The Door to the Lord cannot be found by any other means.
When He becomes Merciful, we come to meditate on the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||
The body is not purified by millions of rituals.
The mind is awakened and enlightened only in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||2||
Thirst and desire are not quenched by enjoying the many pleasures of Maya.
Chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, total peace is found. ||3||
When the Supreme Lord God becomes Merciful,
says Nanak, then one is rid of worldly entanglements. ||4||3||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
Beg for such blessings from the Lord of the Universe:
to work for the Saints, and the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. Chanting the Name of the Lord, the supreme status is obtained. ||1||Pause||
Worship the Feet of Your Lord and Master, and seek His Sanctuary.
Take joy in whatever God does. ||1||
This precious human body becomes fruitful,
