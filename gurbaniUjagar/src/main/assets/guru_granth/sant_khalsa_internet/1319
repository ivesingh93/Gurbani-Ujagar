Raag Kalyaan, Fourth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:
The Lord, the Beauteous Lord - no one has found His limits.
I am a child - You cherish and sustain me. You are the Great Primal Being, my Mother and Father. ||1||Pause||
The Names of the Lord are Countless and Unfathomable. My Sovereign Lord is Unfathomable and Incomprehensible.
The virtuous and the spiritual teachers have given it great thought, but they have not found even an iota of His Value. ||1||
They sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, the Lord of the Universe forever. They sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe, but they do not find His limits.
You are Immeasurable, Unweighable, and Infinite, O Lord and Master; no matter how much one may meditate on You, Your Depth cannot be fathomed. ||2||
Lord, Your humble servants praise You, singing Your Glorious Praises, O Sovereign Lord.
You are the ocean of water, and I am Your fish. No one has ever found Your limits. ||3||
Please be Kind to Your humble servant, Lord; please bless me with the meditation of Your Name.
I am a blind fool; Your Name is my only Support. Servant Nanak, as Gurmukh, has found it. ||4||1||
Kalyaan, Fourth Mehl:
The humble servant of the Lord sings the Lord's Praise, and blossoms forth.
My intellect is embellished with devotion to the Lord, Har, Har, through the Guru's Teachings. This is the destiny which God has recorded on my forehead. ||1||Pause||
I meditate in remembrance on the Guru's Feet, day and night. The Lord, Har, Har, Har, comes to dwell in my mind.
The Praise of the Lord, Har, Har, Har, is Excellent and Sublime in this world. His Praise is the sandalwood paste which I rub. ||1||
The humble servant of the Lord is lovingly attuned to the Lord, Har, Har, Har; all the faithless cynics pursue him.
The slanderous person acts in accordance with the record of his past deeds; his foot trips over the snake, and he is stung by its bite. ||2||
O my Lord and Master, You are the Saving Grace, the Protector of Your humble servants. You protect them, age after age.
What does it matter, if a demon speaks evil? By doing so, he only gets frustrated. ||3||
All the beings and creatures created by God are caught in the mouth of Death.
The humble servants of the Lord are protected by the Lord God, Har, Har, Har; servant Nanak seeks His Sanctuary. ||4||2||
