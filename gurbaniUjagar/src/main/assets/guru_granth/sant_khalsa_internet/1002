One who is blessed with the medicine of the GurMantra, the Name of the Lord, O servant Nanak, does not suffer the agonies of reincarnation. ||5||2||
O man, in this way, you shall cross over to the other side.
Meditate on your Dear Lord, and be dead to the world; renounce your love of duality. ||Second Pause||2||11||
Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:
I have quit searching outside; the Guru has shown me that God is within the home of my own heart.
I have seen God, fearless, of wondrous beauty; my mind shall never leave Him to go anywhere else. ||1||
I have found the jewel; I have found the Perfect Lord.
The invaluable value cannot be obtained; in His Mercy, the Guru bestows it. ||1||Pause||
The Supreme Lord God is imperceptible and unfathomable; meeting the Holy Saint, I speak the Unspoken Speech.
The unstruck sound current of the Shabad vibrates and resounds in the Tenth Gate; the Ambrosial Naam trickles down there. ||2||
I lack nothing; the thirsty desires of my mind are satisfied. The inexhaustible treasure has entered into my being.
I serve the feet, the feet, the feet of the Guru, and manage the unmanageable. I have found the juice, the sublime essence. ||3||
Intuitively I come, and intuitively I go; my mind intuitively plays.
Says Nanak, when the Guru drives out doubt, then the soul-bride enters the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. ||4||3||12||
Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:
You feel no love for the One who created and embellished you.
The seed, planted out season, does not germinate; it does not produce flower or fruit. ||1||
O mind, this is the time to plant the seed of the Name.
Focus your mind, and cultivate this crop; at the proper time, make this your purpose. ||1||Pause||
Eradicate the stubbornness and doubt of your mind, and go to the Sanctuary of the True Guru.
He alone does such deeds, who has such pre-ordained karma. ||2||
He falls in love with the Lord of the Universe, and his efforts are approved.
My crop has germinated, and it shall never be used up. ||3||
I have obtained the priceless wealth, which shall never leave me or go anywhere else.
Says Nanak, I have found peace; I am satisfied and fulfilled. ||4||4||13||
Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:
The egg of doubt has burst; my mind has been enlightened.
The Guru has shattered the shackles on my feet, and has set me free. ||1||
My coming and going in reincarnation is ended.
The boiling cauldron has cooled down; the Guru has blessed me with the cooling, soothing Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Since I joined the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, those who were eyeing me have left.
The one who tied me up, has released me; what can the Watchman of Death do to me now? ||2||
The load of my karma has been removed, and I am now free of karma.
I have crossed the world-ocean, and reached the other shore; the Guru has blessed me with this Dharma. ||3||
True is my place, and True is my seat; I have made Truth my life's purpose.
True is my capital, and True is the merchandise, which Nanak has placed into the home of the heart. ||4||5||14||
