The Perfect Lord is the Lover of His devotees; He fulfills the desires of the mind.
He lifts us up out of the deep, dark pit; enshrine His Name within your mind.
The gods, the Siddhas, the angels, the heavenly singers, the silent sages and the devotees sing Your countless Glorious Praises.
Prays Nanak, please be merciful to me, O Supreme Lord God, my King. ||2||
O my mind, be conscious of the Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent Lord, who wields all power.
He is All-powerful, the Embodiment of compassion. He is the Master of each and every heart;
He is the Support of the breath of life. He is the Giver of the breath of life, of mind, body and soul. He is Infinite, Inaccessible and Unfathomable.
The All-powerful Lord is our Sanctuary; He is the Enticer of the mind, who banishes all sorrows.
All illnesses, sufferings and pains are dispelled, by chanting the Name of the Lord.
Prays Nanak, please be merciful to me, All-powerful Lord; You are the Wielder of all power. ||3||
O my mind, sing the Glorious Praises of the Imperishable, Eternal, Merciful Master, the Highest of all.
The One Lord is the Sustainer of the Universe, the Great Giver; He is the Cherisher of all.
The Cherisher Lord is so very merciful and wise; He is compassionate to all.
The pains of death, greed and emotional attachment simply vanish, when God comes to dwell in the soul.
When the Lord is thoroughly pleased, then one's service becomes perfectly fruitful.
Prays Nanak, my desires are fulfilled by meditating on the Lord, Merciful to the meek. ||4||3||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
Listen, O my companions: let's join together and make the effort, to surrender to our Husband Lord.
Renouncing our pride, let's charm Him with the potion of devotional worship, and the mantra of the Holy Saints.
O my companions, when He comes under our power, He shall never leave us again. This is the good nature of the Lord God.
O Nanak, God dispels the fear of old age, death and hell; He purifies His beings. ||1||
Listen, O my companions, to my sincere prayer: let's make this firm resolve.
In the peaceful poise of intuitive bliss, violence will be gone, as we sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe.
Our pains and troubles shall be eradicated, and our doubts shall be dispelled; we will receive the fruits of our minds' desires.
O Nanak, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Supreme Lord God, the Perfect, Transcendent Lord. ||2||
O my companions, I yearn for Him continually; I invoke His Blessings, and pray that God may fulfill my hopes.
I thirst for His Feet, and I long for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan; I look for Him everywhere.
I search for traces of the Lord in the Society of the Saints; they will unite me with the All-powerful Primal Lord God.
O Nanak, those humble, noble beings who meet the Lord, the Giver of peace, are very blessed, O my mother. ||3||
O my companions, now I dwell with my Beloved Husband; my mind and body are attuned to the Lord.
Listen, O my companions: now I sleep well, since I found my Husband Lord.
My doubts have been dispelled, and I have found intuitive peace and tranquility through my Lord and Master. I have been enlightened, and my heart-lotus has blossomed forth.
I have obtained God, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, as my Husband; O Nanak, my marriage shall last forever. ||4||4||2||5||11||
