Come, and join together, O my companions; let's sing the Glorious Praises of my God, and follow the comforting advice of the True Guru.. ||3||
Please fulfill the hopes of servant Nanak, O Lord; his body finds peace and tranquility in the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan. ||4||6|| Chhakaa 1.||
Raag Gond, Fifth Mehl, Chau-Padas, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
He is the Creator of all, He is the Enjoyer of all. ||1||Pause||
The Creator listens, and the Creator sees.
The Creator is unseen, and the Creator is seen.
The Creator forms, and the Creator destroys.
The Creator touches, and the Creator is detached. ||1||
The Creator is the One who speaks, and the Creator is the One who understands.
The Creator comes, and the Creator also goes.
The Creator is absolute and without qualities; the Creator is related, with the most excellent qualities.
By Guru's Grace, Nanak looks upon all the same. ||2||1||
Gond, Fifth Mehl:
You are caught, like the fish and the monkey; you are entangled in the transitory world.
Your foot-steps and your breaths are numbered; only by singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord will you be saved. ||1||
O mind, reform yourself, and forsake your aimless wandering.
You have found no place of rest for yourself; so why do you try to teach others? ||1||Pause||
Like the elephant, driven by sexual desire, you are attached to your family.
People are like birds that come together, and fly apart again; you shall become stable and steady, only when you meditate on the Lord, Har, Har, in the Company of the Holy. ||2||
Like the fish, which perishes because of its desire to taste, the fool is ruined by his greed.
You have fallen under the power of the five thieves; escape is only possible in the Sanctuary of the Lord. ||3||
Be Merciful to me, O Destroyer of the pains of the meek; all beings and creatures belong to You.
May I obtain the gift of always seeing the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan; meeting with You, Nanak is the slave of Your slaves. ||4||2||
Raag Gond, Fifth Mehl, Chau-Padas, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
He fashioned the soul and the breath of life,
and infused His Light into the dust;
He exalted you and gave you everything to use, and food to eat and enjoy -
how can you forsake that God, you fool! Where else will you go? ||1||
Commit yourself to the service of the Transcendent Lord.
Through the Guru, one understands the Immaculate, Divine Lord. ||1||Pause||
He created plays and dramas of all sorts;
He creates and destroys in an instant;
His state and condition cannot be described.
Meditate forever on that God, O my mind. ||2||
The unchanging Lord does not come or go.
His Glorious Virtues are infinite; how many of them can I count?
