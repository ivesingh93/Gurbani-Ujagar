Raag Kaanraa, Chau-Padas, Fourth Mehl, First House:
One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:
Meeting with the Holy people, my mind blossoms forth.
I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice to those Holy beings; joining the Sangat, the Congregation, I am carried across to the other side. ||1||Pause||
O Lord, Har, Har, please bless me with Your Mercy, God, that I may fall at the feet of the Holy.
Blessed, blessed are the Holy, who know the Lord God. Meeting with the Holy, even sinners are saved. ||1||
The mind roams and rambles all around in all directions. Meeting with the Holy, it is overpowered and brought under control,
just as when the fisherman spreads his net over the water, he catches and overpowers the fish. ||2||
The Saints, the Saints of the Lord, are noble and good. Meeting with the humble Saints, filth is washed away.
All the sins and egotism are washed away, like soap washing dirty clothes. ||3||
According to that pre-ordained destiny inscribed on my forehead by my Lord and Master, I have enshrined the Feet of the Guru, the True Guru, within my heart.
I have found God, the Destroyer of all poverty and pain; servant Nanak is saved through the Naam. ||4||1||
Kaanraa, Fourth Mehl:
My mind is the dust of the feet of the Saints.
Joining the Sangat, the Congregation, I listen to the sermon of the Lord, Har, Har. My crude and uncultured mind is drenched with the Love of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
I am thoughtless and unconscious; I do not know God's state and extent. The Guru has made me thoughtful and conscious.
God is Merciful to the meek; He has made me His Own. My mind chants and meditates on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||
Meeting with the Lord's Saints, the Beloveds of the mind, I would cut out my heart, and offer it to them.
Meeting with the Lord's Saints, I meet with the Lord; this sinner has been sanctified. ||2||
The humble servants of the Lord are said to be exalted in this world; meeting with them, even stones are softened.
