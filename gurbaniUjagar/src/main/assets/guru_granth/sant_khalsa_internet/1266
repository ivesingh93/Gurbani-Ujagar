I sing of the Lord, and I speak of the Lord; I have discarded all other loves. ||1||
My Beloved is the Enticer of the mind; The Detached Lord God is the Embodiment of Supreme bliss.
Nanak lives by gazing upon the Lord; may I see Him for a moment, for even just an instant. ||2||2||9||9||13||9||31||
Raag Malaar, Fifth Mehl, Chau-Padas, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
What are you so worried about? What are you thinking? What have you tried?
Tell me - the Lord of the Universe - who controls Him? ||1||
The rain showers down from the clouds, O companion. The Guest has come into my home.
I am meek; my Lord and Master is the Ocean of Mercy. I am absorbed in the nine treasures of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
I have prepared all sorts of foods in various ways, and all sorts of sweet deserts.
I have made my kitchen pure and sacred. Now, O my Sovereign Lord King, please sample my food. ||2||
The villains have been destroyed, and my friends are delighted. This is Your Own Mansion and Temple, O Lord.
When my Playful Beloved came into my household, then I found total peace. ||3||
In the Society of the Saints, I have the Support and Protection of the Perfect Guru; this is the pre-ordained destiny inscribed upon my forehead.
Servant Nanak has found his Playful Husband Lord. He shall never suffer in sorrow again. ||4||1||
Malaar, Fifth Mehl:
When the baby's only food is milk, it cannot survive without its milk.
The mother takes care of it, and pours milk into its mouth; then, it is satisfied and fulfilled. ||1||
I am just a baby; God, the Great Giver, is my Father.
The child is so foolish; it makes so many mistakes. But it has nowhere else to go. ||1||Pause||
The mind of the poor child is fickle; he touches even snakes and fire.
His mother and father hug him close in their embrace, and so he plays in joy and bliss. ||2||
What hunger can the child ever have, O my Lord and Master, when You are his Father?
The treasure of the Naam and the nine treasures are in Your celestial household. You fulfill the desires of the mind. ||3||
My Merciful Father has issued this Command: whatever the child asks for, is put into his mouth.
Nanak, the child, longs for the Blessed Vision of God's Darshan. May His Feet always dwell within my heart. ||4||2||
Malaar, Fifth Mehl:
I tried everything, and gathered all devices together; I have discarded all my anxieties.
I have begun to set all my household affairs right; I have placed my faith in my Lord and Master. ||1||
I listen to the celestial vibrations resonating and resounding.
Sunrise has come, and I gaze upon the Face of my Beloved. My household is filled with peace and pleasure. ||1||Pause||
I focus my mind, and embellish and adorn the place within; then I go out to speak with the Saints.
Seeking and searching, I have found my Husband Lord; I bow at His Feet and worship Him with devotion. ||2||
