Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
By their own efforts, the slanderers have destroyed all remnants of themselves.
The Support of the Saints, O Nanak, is manifest, pervading everywhere. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
Those who went astray from the Primal Being in the very beginning - where can they find refuge?
O Nanak, they are struck down by the All-powerful, the Cause of causes. ||2||
Pauree, Fifth Mehl:
They take the noose in their hands, and go out at night to strangle others, but God knows everything, O mortal.
They spy on other men's women, concealed in their hiding places.
They break into well-protected places, and revel in sweet wine.
But they shall come to regret their actions - they create their own karma.
Azraa-eel, the Angel of Death, shall crush them like sesame seeds in the oil-press. ||27||
Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
The servants of the True King are acceptable and approved.
Those ignorant ones who serve duality, O Nanak, rot, waste away and die. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
That destiny which was pre-ordained by God from the very beginning cannot be erased.
The wealth of the Lord's Name is Nanak's capital; he meditates on it forever. ||2||
Pauree, Fifth Mehl:
One who has received a kick from the Lord God - where can he place his foot?
He commits countless sins, and continually eats poison.
Slandering others, he wastes away and dies; within his body, he burns.
One who has been struck down by the True Lord and Master - who can save him now?
Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of the Unseen Lord, the Primal Being. ||28||
Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
In the most horrible hell, there is terrible pain and suffering. It is the place of the ungrateful.
They are struck down by God, O Nanak, and they dIE a most miserable death. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
All kinds of medicines may be prepared, but there is no cure for the slanderer.
Those whom the Lord Himself misleads, O Nanak, putrefy and rot in reincarnation. ||2||
Pauree, Fifth Mehl:
By His Pleasure, the True Guru has blessed me with the inexhaustible wealth of the Name of the True Lord.
All my anxiety is ended; I am rid of the fear of death.
Sexual desire, anger and other evils have been subdued in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
Those who serve another, instead of the True Lord, dIE unfulfilled in the end.
The Guru has blessed Nanak with forgiveness; he is united with the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||29||
Shalok, Fourth Mehl:
He is not a penitent, who is greedy within his heart, and who constantly chases after Maya like a leper.
When this penitent was first invited, he refused our charity; but later he repented and sent his son, who was seated in the congregation.
The village elders all laughed, saying that the waves of greed have destroyed this penitent.
If he sees only a little wealth, he does not bother to go there; but when he sees a lot of wealth, the penitent forsakes his vows.
O Siblings of Destiny, he is not a penitent - he is only a stork. Sitting together, the Holy Congregation has so decided.
The penitent slanders the True Primal Being, and sings the praises of the material world. For this sin, he is cursed by the Lord.
Behold the fruit the penitent gathers, for slandering the Great Primal Being; all his labors have gone in vain.
When he sits outside among the elders, he is called a penitent;
but when he sits within the congregation, the penitent commits sin.
