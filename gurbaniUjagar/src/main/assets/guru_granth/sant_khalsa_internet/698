The Righteous Judge of Dharma, in the Court of the Lord, has torn up my papers; servant Nanak's account has been settled. ||4||5||
Jaitsree, Fourth Mehl:
In the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, I found the Holy, by great good fortune; my restless mind has been quieted.
The unstruck melody ever vibrates and resounds; I have taken in the sublime essence of the Lord's Ambrosial Nectar, showering down. ||1||
O my mind, chant the Name of the Lord, the beauteous Lord.
The True Guru has drenched my mind and body with the Love of the Lord, who has met me and lovingly embraced me. ||Pause||
The faithless cynics are bound and gagged in the chains of Maya; they are actively engaged, gathering in the poisonous wealth.
They cannot spend this in harmony with the Lord, and so they must endure the pain which the Messenger of Death inflicts upon their heads. ||2||
The Holy Guru has dedicated His Being to the Lord's service; with great devotion, apply the dust of His feet to your face.
In this world and the next, you shall receive the Lord's honor, and your mind shall be imbued with the permanent color of the Lord's Love. ||3||
O Lord, Har, Har, please unite me with the Holy; compared to these Holy people, I am just a worm.
Servant Nanak has enshrined love for the feet of the Holy Guru; meeting with this Holy One, my foolish, stone-like mind has blossomed forth in lush profusion. ||4||6||
