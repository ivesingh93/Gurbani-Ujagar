The Name of the Lord is known as True, through the Love of the Beloved Guru.
True Glorious Greatness is obtained from the Guru, through the Beloved True Name.
The One True Lord is permeating and pervading among all; how rare is the one who contemplates this.
The Lord Himself unites us in Union, and forgives us; He embellishes us with true devotional worship. ||7||
All is Truth; Truth, and Truth alone is pervading; how rare is the Gurmukh who knows this.
Birth and death occur by the Hukam of His Command; the Gurmukh understands his own self.
He meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and so pleases the True Guru. He receives whatever rewards he desires.
O Nanak, one who eradicates self-conceit from within, has everything. ||8||1||
Soohee, Third Mehl:
The body-bride is very beautiful; she dwells with her Husband Lord.
She becomes the happy soul-bride of her True Husband Lord, contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
The Lord's devotee is forever attuned to the Lord's Love; her ego is burnt away from within. ||1||
Waaho! Waaho! Blessed, blessed is the Word of the Perfect Guru's Bani.
It wells up and springs forth from the Perfect Guru, and merges into Truth. ||1||Pause||
Everything is within the Lord - the continents, worlds and nether regions.
The Life of the World, the Great Giver, dwells within the body; He is the Cherisher of all.
The body-bride is eternally beautiful; the Gurmukh contemplates the Naam. ||2||
The Lord Himself dwells within the body; He is invisible and cannot be seen.
The foolish self-willed manmukh does not understand; he goes out searching for the Lord externally.
One who serves the True Guru is always at peace; the True Guru has shown me the Invisible Lord. ||3||
Within the body there are jewels and precious treasures, the over-flowing treasure of devotion.
Within this body are the nine continents of the earth, its markets, cities and streets.
Within this body are the nine treasures of the Naam; contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad, it is obtained. ||4||
Within the body, the Lord estimates the weight; He Himself is the weigher.
This mind is the jewel, the gem, the diamond; it is absolutely priceless.
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, cannot be purchased at any price; the Naam is obtained by contemplating the Guru. ||5||
One who becomes Gurmukh searches this body; all others just wander around in confusion.
That humble being alone obtains it, unto whom the Lord bestows it. What other clever tricks can anyone try?
Within the body, the Fear of God and Love for Him abides; by Guru's Grace, they are obtained. ||6||
Within the body, are Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, from whom the whole world emanated.
The True Lord has staged and contrived His own play; the expanse of the Universe comes and goes.
The Perfect True Guru Himself has made it clear, that emancipation comes through the True Name. ||7||
That body, which serves the True Guru, is embellished by the True Lord Himself.
Without the Name, the mortal finds no place of rest in the Court of the Lord; he shall be tortured by the Messenger of Death.
O Nanak, true glory is bestowed, when the Lord showers His Mercy. ||8||2||
