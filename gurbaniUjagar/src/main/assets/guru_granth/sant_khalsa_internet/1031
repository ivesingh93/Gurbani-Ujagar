Practicing egotism and possessiveness, you have come into the world.
Hope and desire bind you and lead you on.
Indulging in egotism and self-conceit, what will you be able to carry with you, except the load of ashes from poison and corruption? ||15||
Worship the Lord in devotion, O humble Siblings of Destiny.
Speak the Unspoken Speech, and the mind will merge back into the Mind.
Restrain your restless mind within its own home, and the Lord, the Destroyer, shall destroy your pain. ||16||
I seek the support of the Perfect Guru, the Lord.
The Gurmukh loves the Lord; the Gurmukh realizes the Lord.
O Nanak, through the Lord's Name, the intellect is exalted; granting His forgiveness, the Lord carries him across to the other side. ||17||4||10||
Maaroo, First Mehl:
O Divine Guru, I have entered Your Sanctuary.
You are the Almighty Lord, the Merciful Lord.
No one knows Your wondrous plays; You are the perfect Architect of Destiny. ||1||
From the very beginning of time, and throughout the ages, You cherish and sustain Your beings.
You are in each and every heart, O Merciful Lord of incomparable beauty.
As You will, You cause all to walk; everyone acts according to Your Command. ||2||
Deep within the nucleus of all, is the Light of the Life of the World.
The Lord enjoys the hearts of all, and drinks in their essence.
He Himself gives, and He himself takes; He is the generous father of the beings of the three worlds. ||3||
Creating the world, He has set His play into motion.
He placed the soul in the body of air, water and fire.
The body-village has nine gates; the Tenth Gate remains hidden. ||4||
There are four horrible rivers of fire.
How rare is that Gurmukh who understands this, and through the Word of the Shabad, remains unattached.
The faithless cynics are drowned and burnt through their evil-mindedness. The Guru saves those who are imbued with the Love of the Lord. ||5||
Water, fire, air, earth and ether -
in that house of the five elements, they dwell.
Those who remain imbued with the Word of the True Guru's Shabad, renounce Maya, egotism and doubt. ||6||
This mind is drenched with the Shabad, and satisfied.
Without the Name, what support can anyone have?
The temple of the body is being plundered by the thieves within, but this faithless cynic does not even recognize these demons. ||7||
They are argumentative demons, terrifying goblins.
These demons stir up conflict and strife.
Without awareness of the Shabad, one comes and goes in reincarnation; he loses his honor in this coming and going. ||8||
The body of the false person is just a pile of barren dirt.
Without the Name, what honor can you have?
Bound and gagged throughout the four ages, there is no liberation; the Messenger of Death keeps such a person under his gaze. ||9||
At Death's door, he is tied up and punished;
such a sinner does not obtain salvation.
He cries out in pain, like the fish pierced by the hook. ||10||
The faithless cynic is caught in the noose all alone.
The miserable spiritually blind person is caught in the power of Death.
Without the Lord's Name, liberation is not known. He shall waste away, today or tomorrow. ||11||
Other than the True Guru, no one is your friend.
Here and hereafter, God is the Savior.
He grants His Grace, and bestows the Lord's Name. He merges with Him, like water with water. ||12||
