He is like the parrot, who is pleased to see the simbal tree;
but in the end, he dies, stuck to it. ||1||
The home of the sinner is on fire.
It keeps burning, and the fire cannot be extinguished. ||1||Pause||
He does not go to see where the Lord is being worshipped.
He abandons the Lord's Path, and takes the wrong path.
He forgets the Primal Lord God, and is caught in the cycle of reincarnation.
He throws away the Ambrosial Nectar, and gathers poison to eat. ||2||
He is like the prostitute, who comes to dance,
wearing beautiful clothes, decorated and adorned.
She dances to the beat, exciting the breath of those who watch her.
But the noose of the Messenger of Death is around her neck. ||3||
One who has good karma recorded on his forehead,
hurries to enter the Guru's Sanctuary.
Says Naam Dayv, consider this:
O Saints, this is the way to cross over to the other side. ||4||2||8||
Sanda and Marka went and complained to Harnaakhash,
Your son does not read his lessons. We are tired of trying to teach him.
He chants the Lord's Name, clapping his hands to keep the beat; he has spoiled all the other students. ||1||
He chants the Lord's Name,
and he has enshrined meditative remembrance of the Lord within his heart."||1||Pause||
Your father the king has conquered the whole world, said his mother the queen.
O Prahlad my son, you do not obey him, so he has decided to deal with you in another way.||2||
The council of villains met and resolved to send Prahlaad into the life hereafter.
Prahlaad was thrown off a mountain, into the water, and into a fire, but the Sovereign Lord God saved him, by changing the laws of nature. ||3||
Harnaakhash thundered with rage and threatened to kill Prahlaad. "Tell me, who can save you?
Prahlaad answered, "The Lord, the Master of the three worlds, is contained even in this pillar to which I am tied."||4||
The Lord who tore Harnaakhash apart with His nails proclaimed Himself the Lord of gods and men.
Says Naam Dayv, I meditate on the Lord, the Man-lion, the Giver of fearless dignity. ||5||3||9||
The Sultan said, "Listen, Naam Dayv:

The Sultan arrested Naam Dayv,
and said, "Let me see your Beloved Lord."||1||Pause||
Bring this dead cow back to life.
Otherwise, I shall cut off your head here and now."||2||
Naam Dayv answered, "O king, how can this happen?
No one can bring the dead back to life. ||3||
I cannot do anything by my own actions.
Whatever the Lord does, that alone happens."||4||
The arrogant king was enraged at this reply.
He incited an elephant to attack. ||5||
Naam Dayv's mother began to cry,
and she said, "Why don't you abandon your Lord Raam, and worship his Lord Allah?"||6||
Naam Dayv answered, "I am not your son, and you are not my mother.
Even if my body dies, I will still sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord."||7||
The elephant attacked him with his trunk,
but Naam Dayv was saved, protected by the Lord. ||8||
The king said, "The Qazis and the Mullahs bow down to me,
but this Hindu has trampled my honor."||9||
The people pleaded with the king, "Hear our prayer, O king.
