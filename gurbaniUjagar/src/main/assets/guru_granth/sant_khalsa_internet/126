He Himself is the Highest of the High.
How rare are those who behold Him. He causes Himself to be seen.
O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides deep within the hearts of those who see the Lord themselves, and inspire others to see Him as well. ||8||26||27||
Maajh, Third Mehl:
My God is pervading and permeating all places.
By Guru's Grace, I have found Him within the home of my own heart.
I serve Him constantly, and I meditate on Him single-mindedly. As Gurmukh, I am absorbed in the True One. ||1||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who enshrine the Lord, the Life of the World, within their minds.
Through the Guru's Teachings, I merge with intuitive ease into the Lord, the Life of the World, the Fearless One, the Great Giver. ||1||Pause||
Within the home of the self is the earth, its support and the nether regions of the underworld.
Within the home of the self is the Eternally Young Beloved.
The Giver of peace is eternally blissful. Through the Guru's Teachings, we are absorbed in intuitive peace. ||2||
When the body is filled with ego and selfishness,
the cycle of birth and death does not end.
One who becomes Gurmukh subdues egotism, and meditates on the Truest of the True. ||3||
Within this body are the two brothers, sin and virtue.
When the two joined together, the Universe was produced.
Subduing both, and entering into the Home of the One, through the Guru's Teachings, we are absorbed in intuitive peace. ||4||
Within the home of the self is the darkness of the love of duality.
When the Divine Light dawns, ego and selfishness are dispelled.
The Giver of peace is revealed through the Shabad, meditating upon the Naam, night and day. ||5||
Deep within the self is the Light of God; It radiates throughout the expanse of His creation.
Through the Guru's Teachings, the darkness of spiritual ignorance is dispelled.
The heart-lotus blossoms forth, and eternal peace is obtained, as one's light merges into the Light. ||6||
Within the mansion is the treasure house, overflowing with jewels.
The Gurmukh obtains the Infinite Naam, the Name of the Lord.
The Gurmukh, the trader, always purchases the merchandise of the Naam, and always reaps profits. ||7||
The Lord Himself keeps this merchandise in stock, and He Himself distributes it.
Rare is that Gurmukh who trades in this.
O Nanak, those upon whom the Lord casts His Glance of Grace, obtain it. Through His Mercy, it is enshrined in the mind. ||8||27||28||
Maajh, Third Mehl:
The Lord Himself leads us to merge with Him and serve Him.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, the love of duality is eradicated.
The Immaculate Lord is the Bestower of eternal virtue. The Lord Himself leads us to merge in His Virtuous Goodness. ||1||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who enshrine the Truest of the True within their hearts.
The True Name is eternally pure and immaculate. Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, it is enshrined within the mind. ||1||Pause||
The Guru Himself is the Giver, the Architect of Destiny.
The Gurmukh, the humble servant who serves the Lord, comes to know Him.
Those humble beings look beautiful forever in the Ambrosial Naam. Through the Guru's Teachings, they receive the sublime essence of the Lord. ||2||
Within the cave of this body, there is one beautiful place.
Through the Perfect Guru, ego and doubt are dispelled.
Night and day, praise the Naam, the Name of the Lord; imbued with the Lord's Love, by Guru's Grace, you shall find Him. ||3||
