Pauree:
Deception does not work with our Lord and Master; through their greed and emotional attachment, people are ruined.
They do their evil deeds, and sleep in the intoxication of Maya.
Time and time again, they are consigned to reincarnation, and abandoned on the path of Death.
They receive the consequences of their own actions, and are yoked to their pain.
O Nanak, if one forgets the Name, all the seasons are evil. ||12||
Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
While standing up, sitting down and sleeping, be at peace;
O Nanak, praising the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the mind and body are cooled and soothed. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
Filled with greed, he constantly wanders around; he does not do any good deeds.
O Nanak, the Lord abides within the mind of one who meets with the Guru. ||2||
Pauree:
All material things are bitter; the True Name alone is sweet.
Those humble servants of the Lord who taste it, come to savor its flavor.
It comes to dwell within the mind of those who are so pre-destined by the Supreme Lord God.
The One Immaculate Lord is pervading everywhere; He destroys the love of duality.
Nanak begs for the Lord's Name, with his palms pressed together; by His Pleasure, God has granted it. ||13||
Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
The most excellent begging is begging for the One Lord.
Other talk is corrupt, O Nanak, except that of the Lord Master. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
One who recognizes the Lord is very rare; his mind is pierced through with the Love of the Lord.
Such a Saint is the Uniter, O Nanak - he straightens out the path. ||2||
Pauree:
Serve Him, O my soul, who is the Giver and the Forgiver.
All sinful mistakes are erased, by meditating in remembrance on the Lord of the Universe.
The Holy Saint has shown me the Way to the Lord; I chant the GurMantra.
The taste of Maya is totally bland and insipid; the Lord alone is pleasing to my mind.
Meditate, O Nanak, on the Transcendent Lord, who has blessed you with your soul and your life. ||14||
Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
The time has come to plant the seed of the Lord's Name; one who plants it, shall eat its fruit.
He alone receives it, O Nanak, whose destiny is so pre-ordained. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
If one begs, then he should beg for the Name of the True One, which is given only by His Pleasure.
Eating this gift from the Lord and Master, O Nanak, the mind is satisfied. ||2||
Pauree:
They alone earn profit in this world, who have the wealth of the Lord's Name.
They do not know the love of duality; they place their hopes in the True Lord.
They serve the One Eternal Lord, and give up everything else.
One who forgets the Supreme Lord God - useless is his breath.
God draws His humble servant close in His loving embrace and protects him - Nanak is a sacrifice to Him. ||15||
Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
The Supreme Lord God gave the Order, and the rain automatically began to fall.
Grain and wealth were produced in abundance; the earth was totally satisfied and satiated.
Forever and ever, chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and pain and poverty shall run away.
People obtain that which they are pre-ordained to receive, according to the Will of the Lord.
The Transcendent Lord keeps you alive; O Nanak, meditate on Him. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
To obtain the state of life of Nirvaanaa, meditate in remembrance on the One Lord.
