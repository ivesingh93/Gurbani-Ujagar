Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl, Tenth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Give me that blessing, O Dear Saints, for which my soul would be a sacrifice.
Enticed by pride, entrapped and plundered by the five thieves, still, you live near them. I have come to the Sanctuary of the Holy, and I have been rescued from my association with those demons. ||1||Pause||
I wandered through millions of lifetimes and incarnations. I am so very tired - I have fallen at God's Door. ||1||
The Lord of the Universe has become Kind to me; He has blessed me with the Support of the Naam.
This precious human life has become fruitful and prosperous; O Nanak, I am carried across the terrifying world-ocean. ||2||1||45||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl, Eleventh House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
He Himself has come to me, in His Natural Way.
I know nothing, and I show nothing.
I have met God through innocent faith, and He has blessed me with peace. ||1||Pause||
By the good fortune of my destiny, I have joined the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
I do not go out anywhere; I dwell in my own home.
God, the Treasure of Virtue, has been revealed in this body-robe. ||1||
I have fallen in love with His Feet; I have abandoned everything else.
In the places and inter-spaces, He is All-pervading.
With loving joy and excitement, Nanak speaks His Praises. ||2||1||46||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
It is so hard to meet the Lord of the Universe, my Lord and Master.
His Form is Immeasurable, Inaccessible and Unfathomable; He is All-pervading everywhere. ||1||Pause||
By speaking and wandering, nothing is gained; nothing is obtained by clever tricks and devices. ||1||
People try all sorts of things, but the Lord is only met when He shows His Mercy.
God is Kind and Compassionate, the Treasure of Mercy; servant Nanak is the dust of the feet of the Saints. ||2||2||47||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
O mother, I meditate on the Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam.
Without God, there is no other at all.
I remember His Lotus Feet with every breath, night and day. ||1||Pause||
He loves me and makes me His Own; my union with Him shall never be broken.
He is my breath of life, mind, wealth and everything. The Lord is the Treasure of Virtue and Peace. ||1||
Here and hereafter, the Lord is perfectly pervading; He is seen deep within the heart.
In the Sanctuary of the Saints, I am carried across; O Nanak, the terrible pain has been taken away. ||2||3||48||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
God's humble servant is in love with Him.
You are my Friend, my very best Friend; everything is in Your Home. ||1||Pause||
I beg for honor, I beg for strength; please bless me with wealth, property and children. ||1||
You are the Technology of liberation, the Way to worldly success, the Perfect Lord of Supreme Bliss, the Transcendent Treasure.
