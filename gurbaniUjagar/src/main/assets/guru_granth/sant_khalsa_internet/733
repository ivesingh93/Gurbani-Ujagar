Even if he wishes it a hundred times, he does not obtain the Lord's Love. ||3||
But if the Lord blesses him with His Glance of Grace, then he meets the True Guru.
Nanak is absorbed into the subtle essence of the Lord's Love. ||4||2||6||
Soohee, Fourth Mehl:
My tongue remains satisfied with the subtle essence of the Lord.
The Gurmukh drinks it in, and merges in celestial peace. ||1||
If you taste the subtle essence of the Lord, O humble Siblings of Destiny,
then how can you be enticed by other flavors? ||1||Pause||
Under Guru's Instructions, keep this subtle essence enshrined in your heart.
Those who are imbued with the subtle essence of the Lord, are immersed in celestial bliss. ||2||
The self-willed manmukh cannot even taste the subtle essence of the Lord.
He acts out in ego, and suffers terrible punishment. ||3||
But if he is blessed with the Lord's Kind Mercy, then he obtains the subtle essence of the Lord.
O Nanak, absorbed in this subtle essence of the Lord, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||4||3||7||
Soohee, Fourth Mehl, Sixth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
When someone of low social class chants the Lord's Name, he obtains the state of highest dignity.
Go and ask Bidar, the son of a maid; Krishna himself stayed in his house. ||1||
Listen, O humble Siblings of Destiny, to the Unspoken Speech of the Lord; it removes all anxiety, pain and hunger. ||1||Pause||
Ravi Daas, the leather-worker, praised the Lord, and sang the Kirtan of His Praises each and every instant.
Although he was of low social status, he was exalted and elevated, and people of all four castes came and bowed at his feet. ||2||
Naam Dayv loved the Lord; the people called him a fabric dyer.
The Lord turned His back on the high-class Kashatriyas and Brahmins, and showed His face to Naam Dayv. ||3||
All of the devotees and servants of the Lord have the tilak, the ceremonial mark, applied to their foreheads at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage.
Servant Nanak shall touch their feet night and day, if the Lord, the King, grants His Grace. ||4||1||8||
Soohee, Fourth Mehl:
They alone worship and adore the Lord deep within, who are blessed with such pre-ordained destiny from the very beginning of time.
What can anyone do to undermine them? My Creator Lord is on their side. ||1||
So meditate on the Lord, Har, Har, O my mind. Meditate on the Lord, O mind; He is the Eliminator of all the pains of reincarnation. ||1||Pause||
In the very beginning, the Lord blessed His devotees with the Ambrosial Nectar, the treasure of devotion.
Anyone who tries to compete with them is a fool; his face shall be blackened here and hereafter. ||2||
They alone are devotees, and they alone are selfless servants, who love the Lord's Name.
By their selfless service, they find the Lord, while ashes fall on the heads of the slanderers. ||3||
He alone knows this, who experiences it within the home of his own self. Ask Guru Nanak, the Guru of the world, and reflect upon it.
Throughout the four generations of the Gurus, from the beginning of time and throughout the ages, no one has ever found the Lord by back-biting and undermining. Only by serving the Lord with love, is one emancipated. ||4||2||9||
Soohee, Fourth Mehl:
Wherever the Lord is worshipped in adoration, there the Lord becomes one's friend and helper.
