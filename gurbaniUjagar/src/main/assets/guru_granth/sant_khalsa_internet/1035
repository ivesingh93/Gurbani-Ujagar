I am the slave of Your slaves, O my Beloved.
The seekers of Truth and goodness contemplate You.
Whoever believes in the Name, wins; He Himself implants Truth within. ||10||
The Truest of the True has the Truth is His lap.
The True Lord is pleased with those who love the Shabad.
Exerting His power, the Lord has established Truth throughout the three worlds; with Truth He is pleased. ||11||
Everyone calls Him the greatest of the great.
Without the Guru, no one understands Him.
The True Lord is pleased with those who merge in Truth; they are not separated again, and they do not suffer. ||12||
Separated from the Primal Lord, they loudly weep and wail.
They dIE and die, only to be reborn, when their time has passed.
He blesses those whom He forgives with glorious greatness; united with Him, they do not regret or repent. ||13 |
| He Himself is the Creator, and He Himself is the Enjoyer.
He Himself is satisfied, and He Himself is liberated.
The Lord of liberation Himself grants liberation; He eradicates possessiveness and attachment. ||14||
I consider Your gifts to be the most wonderful gifts.
You are the Cause of causes, Almighty Infinite Lord.
Creating the creation, You gaze upon what You have created; You cause all to do their deeds. ||15||
They alone sing Your Glorious Praises, who are pleasing to You, O True Lord.
They issue forth from You, and merge again into You.
Nanak offers this true prayer; meeting with the True Lord, peace is obtained. ||16||2||14||
Maaroo, First Mehl:
For endless eons, there was only utter darkness.
There was no earth or sky; there was only the infinite Command of His Hukam.
There was no day or night, no moon or sun; God sat in primal, profound Samaadhi. ||1||
There were no sources of creation or powers of speech, no air or water.
There was no creation or destruction, no coming or going.
There were no continents, nether regions, seven seas, rivers or flowing water. ||2||
There were no heavenly realms, earth or nether regions of the underworld.
There was no heaven or hell, no death or time.
There was no hell or heaven, no birth or death, no coming or going in reincarnation. ||3||
There was no Brahma, Vishnu or Shiva.
No one was seen, except the One Lord.
There was no female or male, no social class or caste of birth; no one experienced pain or pleasure. ||4||
There were no people of celibacy or charity; no one lived in the forests.
There were no Siddhas or seekers, no one living in peace.
There were no Yogis, no wandering pilgrims, no religious robes; no one called himself the master. ||5||
There was no chanting or meditation, no self-discipline, fasting or worship.
No one spoke or talked in duality.
He created Himself, and rejoiced; He evaluates Himself. ||6||
There was no purification, no self-restraint, no malas of basil seeds.
There were no Gopis, no Krishna, no cows or cowherds.
There were no tantras, no mantras and no hypocrisy; no one played the flute. ||7||
There was no karma, no Dharma, no buzzing fly of Maya.
Social class and birth were not seen with any eyes.
There was no noose of attachment, no death inscribed upon the forehead; no one meditated on anything. ||8||
There was no slander, no seed, no soul and no life.
There was no Gorakh and no Maachhindra.
There was no spiritual wisdom or meditation, no ancestry or creation, no reckoning of accounts. ||9||
