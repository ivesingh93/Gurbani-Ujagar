The disturbed mind has been absorbed in the Lord; duality and evil-mindedness have run away.
Says Kabeer, I have seen the One Lord, the Fearless One; I am attuned to the Name of the Lord. ||4||2||46||
Gauree Bairaagan, Ti-Padas:
I turned my breath inwards, and pierced through the six chakras of the body, and my awareness was centered on the Primal Void of the Absolute Lord.
Search for the One who does not come or go, who does not die and is not born, O renunciate. ||1||
My mind has turned away from the world, and is absorbed in the Mind of God.
By Guru's Grace, my understanding has been changed; otherwise, I was totally ignorant. ||1||Pause||
That which was near has become distant, and again, that which was distant is near, for those who realize the Lord as He is.
It is like the sugar water made from the candy; only one who drinks it knows its taste. ||2||
Unto whom should I speak Your speech, O Lord; it is beyond the three qualities. Is there anyone with such discerning wisdom?
Says Kabeer, as is the fuse which you apply, so is the flash you will see. ||3||3||47||
Gauree:
There is no rainy season, ocean, sunshine or shade, no creation or destruction there.
No life or death, no pain or pleasure is felt there. There is only the Primal Trance of Samaadhi, and no duality. ||1||
The description of the state of intuitive poise is indescribable and sublime.
It is not measured, and it is not exhausted. It is neither light nor heavy. ||1||Pause||
Neither lower nor upper worlds are there; neither day nor night are there.
There is no water, wind or fire; there, the True Guru is contained. ||2||
The Inaccessible and Unfathomable Lord dwells there within Himself; by Guru's Grace, He is found.
Says Kabeer, I am a sacrifice to my Guru; I remain in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||3||4||48||
Gauree:
With both sin and virtue, the ox of the body is purchased; the air of the breath is the capital which has appeared.
The bag on its back is filled with desire; this is how we purchase the herd. ||1||
My Lord is such a wealthy merchant!
He has made the whole world his peddler. ||1||Pause||
Sexual desire and anger are the tax-collectors, and the waves of the mind are the highway robbers.
The five elements join together and divide up their loot. This is how our herd is disposed of! ||2||
Says Kabeer, listen, O Saints: This is the state of affairs now!
Going uphill, the ox has grown weary; throwing off his load, he continues on his journey. ||3||5||49||
Gauree, Panch-Padas:
For a few short days, the soul-bride stays in her parent's house; then, she must go to her in-laws.
The blind, foolish and ignorant people do not know this. ||1||
Tell me, why is the bride wearing her ordinary clothes?
The guests have arrived at her home, and her Husband has come to take her away. ||1||Pause||
Who has lowered the rope of the breath down, into the well of the world which we see?
The rope of the breath breaks away from the pitcher of the body, and the water-carrier gets up and departs. ||2||
When the Lord and Master is kind and grants His Grace, then her affairs are all resolved.
Then she is known as the happy soul-bride, if she contemplates the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||3||
