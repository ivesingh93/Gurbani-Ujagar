Raag Gauree Poorbee, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Never forget the Lord, Har, Har, from your mind.
Here and hereafter, He is the Giver of all peace. He is the Cherisher of all hearts. ||1||Pause||
He removes the most terrible pains in an instant, if the tongue repeats His Name.
In the Lord's Sanctuary there is soothing coolness, peace and tranquility. He has extinguished the burning fire. ||1||
He saves us from the hellish pit of the womb, and carries us across the terrifying world-ocean.
Adoring His Lotus Feet in the mind, the fear of death is banished. ||2||
He is the Perfect, Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent Lord, lofty, unfathomable and infinite.
Singing His Glorious Praises, and meditating on the Ocean of peace, one's life is not lost in the gamble. ||3||
My mind is engrossed in sexual desire, anger, greed and attachment, O Giver to the unworthy.
Please grant Your Grace, and bless me with Your Name; Nanak is forever a sacrifice to You. ||4||1||138||
Raag Gauree Chaytee, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
There is no peace without devotional worship of the Lord.
Be victorious, and win the priceless jewel of this human life, by meditating on Him in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, even for an instant. ||1||Pause||
Cildren, wealth, spouses, joyful games and pleasures,
have been renounced by many. ||1||
Horses, elephants and the pleasures of power -
leaving these behind, the fool must depart naked. ||2||
The body, scented with musk and sandalwood -
that body shall come to roll in the dust. ||3||
Infatuated with emotional attachment, they think that God is far away.
Says Nanak, he is Ever-present! ||4||1||139||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
O mind, cross over with the Support of the Lord's Name.
The Guru is the boat to carry you across the world-ocean, through the waves of cynicism and doubt. ||1||Pause||
In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, there is only pitch darkness.
The lamp of the Guru's spiritual wisdom illuminates and enlightens. ||1||
The poison of corruption is spread out far and wide.
Only the virtuous are saved, chanting and meditating on the Lord. ||2||
Intoxicated with Maya, the people are asleep.
Meeting the Guru, doubt and fear are dispelled. ||3||
Says Nanak, meditate on the One Lord;
behold Him in each and every heart. ||4||2||140||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
You alone are my Chief Advisor.
I serve You with the Support of the Guru. ||1||Pause||
By various devices, I could not find You.
Taking hold of me, the Guru has made me Your slave. ||1||
I have conquered the five tyrants.
By Guru's Grace, I have vanquished the army of evil. ||2||
I have received the One Name as His bounty and blessing.
Now, I dwell in peace, poise and bliss. ||3||
