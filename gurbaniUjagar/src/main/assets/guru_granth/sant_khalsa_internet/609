By great good fortune, I found the Guru, O Siblings of Destiny, and I meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||3||
The Truth is forever pure, O Siblings of Destiny; those who are true are pure.
When the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace, O Siblings of Destiny, then one obtains Him.
Among millions, O Siblings of Destiny, hardly one humble servant of the Lord is found.
Nanak is imbued with the True Name, O Siblings of Destiny; hearing it, the mind and body become immaculately pure. ||4||2||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl, Du-Tukas:
As long as this person believes in love and hate, it is difficult for him to meet the Lord.
As long as he discriminates between himself and others, he will distance himself from the Lord. ||1||
O Lord, grant me such understanding,
that I might serve the Holy Saints, and seek the protection of their feet, and not forget them, for a moment, even an instant. ||Pause||
O foolish, thoughtless and fickle mind, such understanding did not come into your heart.
Renouncing the Lord of Life, you have become engrossed in other things, and you are involved with your enemies. ||2||
Sorrow does not afflict one who does not harbor self-conceit; in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I have attained this understanding.
Know that the babbling of the faithless cynic is like wind passing by. ||3||
This mind is inundated by millions of sins - what can I say?
Nanak, Your humble servant has come to Your Sanctuary, God; please, erase all his accounts. ||4||3||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
Children, spouses, men and women in one's household, are all bound by Maya.
At the very last moment, none of them shall stand by you; their love is totally false. ||1||
O man, why do you pamper your body so?
It shall disperse like a cloud of smoke; vibrate upon the One, the Beloved Lord. ||Pause||
There are three ways in which the body can be consumed - it can be thrown into water, given to the dogs, or cremated to ashes.
He considers himself to be immortal; he sits in his home, and forgets the Lord, the Cause of causes. ||2||
In various ways, the Lord has fashioned the beads, and strung them on a slender thread.
The thread shall break, O wretched man, and then, you shall repent and regret. ||3||
He created you, and after creating you, He adorned you - meditate on Him day and night.
God has showered His Mercy upon servant Nanak; I hold tight to the Support of the True Guru. ||4||4||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
I met the True Guru, by great good fortune, and my mind has been enlightened.
No one else can equal me, because I have the loving support of my Lord and Master. ||1||
I am a sacrifice to my True Guru.
I am at peace in this world, and I shall be in celestial peace in the next; my home is filled with bliss. ||Pause||
He is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, the Creator, my Lord and Master.
I have become fearless, attached to the Guru's feet; I take the Support of the Name of the One Lord. ||2||
Fruitful is the Blessed Vision of His Darshan; the Form of God is deathless; He is and shall always be.
He hugs His humble servants close, and protects and preserves them; their love for Him is sweet to Him. ||3||
Great is His glorious greatness, and wondrous is His magnificence; through Him, all affairs are resolved.
