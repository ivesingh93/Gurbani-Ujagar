By the highest destiny, you found the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||1||
Without the Perfect Guru, no one is saved.
This is what Baba Nanak says, after deep reflection. ||2||11||
Raag Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The four Vedas proclaim it, but you don't believe them.
The six Shaastras also say one thing.
The eighteen Puraanas all speak of the One God.
Even so, Yogi, you do not understand this mystery. ||1||
The celestial harp plays the incomparable melody,
but in your intoxication, you do not hear it, O Yogi. ||1||Pause||
In the first age, the Golden Age, the village of truth was inhabited.
In the Silver Age of Traytaa Yuga, things began to decline.
In the Brass Age of Dwaapur Yuga, half of it was gone.
Now, only one leg of Truth remains, and the One Lord is revealed. ||2||
The beads are strung upon the one thread.
By means of many, various, diverse knots, they are tied, and kept separate on the string.
The beads of the mala are lovingly chanted upon in many ways.
When the thread is pulled out, the beads come together in one place. ||3||
Throughout the four ages, the One Lord made the body His temple.
It is a treacherous place, with several windows.
Searching and searching, one comes to the Lord's door.
Then, O Nanak, the Yogi attains a home in the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. ||4||
Thus, the celestial harp plays the incomparable melody;
hearing it, the Yogi's mind finds it sweet. ||1||Second Pause||1||12||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
The body is a patch-work of threads.
The muscles are stitched together with the needles of the bones.
The Lord has erected a pillar of water.
O Yogi, why are you so proud? ||1||
Meditate on your Lord Master, day and night.
The patched coat of the body shall last for only a few days. ||1||Pause||
Smearing ashes on your body, you sit in a deep meditative trance.
You wear the ear-rings of 'mine and yours'.
You beg for bread, but you are not satisfied.
Abandoning your Lord Master, you beg from others; you should feel ashamed. ||2||
Your consciousness is restless, Yogi, as you sit in your Yogic postures.
You blow your horn, but still feel sad.
You do not understand Gorakh, your guru.
Again and again, Yogi, you come and go. ||3||
He, unto whom the Master shows Mercy -
unto Him, the Guru, the Lord of the World, I offer my prayer.
One who has the Name as his patched coat, and the Name as his robe,
O servant Nanak, such a Yogi is steady and stable. ||4||
One who meditates on the Master in this way, night and day,
finds the Guru, the Lord of the World, in this life. ||1||Second Pause||2||13||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
He is the Creator, the Cause of causes;
I do not see any other at all.
My Lord and Master is wise and all-knowing.
Meeting with the Gurmukh, I enjoy His Love. ||1||
Such is the sweet, subtle essence of the Lord.
How rare are those who, as Gurmukh, taste it. ||1||Pause||
The Light of the Ambrosial Name of the Lord is immaculate and pure.
