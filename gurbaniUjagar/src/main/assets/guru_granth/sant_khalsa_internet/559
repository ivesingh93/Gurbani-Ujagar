Wadahans, Third Mehl:
Emotional attachment to Maya is darkness; without the Guru, there is no wisdom.
Those who are attached to the Word of the Shabad understand; duality has ruined the people. ||1||
O my mind, under Guru's Instruction, do good deeds.
Dwell forever and ever upon the Lord God, and you shall find the gate of salvation. ||1||Pause||
The Lord alone is the treasure of virtue; He Himself gives, and then one receives.
Without the Name, all are separated from the Lord; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, one meets the Lord. ||2||
Acting in ego, they lose, and nothing comes into their hands.
Meeting the True Guru, they find Truth, and merge into the True Name. ||3||
Hope and desire abide in this body, but the Lord's Light shines within as well.
O Nanak, the self-willed manmukhs remain in bondage; the Gurmukhs are liberated. ||4||3||
Wadahans, Third Mehl:
The faces of the happy soul-brides are radiant forever; through the Guru, they are peacefully poised.
They enjoy their Husband Lord constantly, eradicating their ego from within. ||1||
O my mind, meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
The True Guru has led me to understand the Lord. ||1||Pause||
The abandoned brides cry out in their suffering; they do not attain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.
In the love of duality, they appear so ugly; they suffer in pain as they go to the world beyond. ||2||
The virtuous soul-bride constantly chants the Glorious Praises of the Lord; she enshrines the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within her heart.
The unvirtuous woman suffers, and cries out in pain. ||3||
The One Lord and Master is the Husband Lord of all; His Praises cannot be expressed.
O Nanak, He has separated some from Himself, while others are to His Name. ||4||4||
Wadahans, Third Mehl:
The Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam is always sweet to me; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I come to taste it.
Through the True Word of the Guru's Bani, I am merged in peace and poise; the Dear Lord is enshrined in the mind. ||1||
The Lord, showing His Mercy, has caused me to meet the True Guru.
Through the Perfect True Guru, I meditate on the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Through Brahma, the hymns of the Vedas were revealed, but the love of Maya spread.
The wise one, Shiva, remains absorbed in himself, but he is engrossed in dark passions and excessive egotism. ||2||
Vishnu is always busy reincarnating himself - who will save the world?
The Gurmukhs are imbued with spiritual wisdom in this age; they are rid of the darkness of emotional attachment. ||3||
Serving the True Guru, one is emancipated; the Gurmukh crosses over the world-ocean.
The detached renunciates are imbued with the True Name; they attain the gate of salvation. ||4||
The One True Lord is pervading and permeating everywhere; He cherishes everyone.
O Nanak, without the One Lord, I do not know any other; He is the Merciful Master of all. ||5||5||
Wadahans, Third Mehl:
The Gurmukh practices true self-discipline, and attains the essence of wisdom.
The Gurmukh meditates on the True Lord. ||1||
