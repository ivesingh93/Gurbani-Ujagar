God Himself has heard the prayers of His humble devotees.
He dispelled my disease, and rejuvenated me; His glorious radiance is so great! ||1||
He has forgiven me for my sins, and interceded with His power.
I have been blessed with the fruits of my mind's desires; Nanak is a sacrifice to Him. ||2||16||80||
Raag Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl, Chau-Padas And Du-Padas, Sixth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O my fascinating Lord, let me not listen to the faithless cynic,
singing his songs and tunes, and chanting his useless words. ||1||Pause||
I serve, serve, serve, serve the Holy Saints; forever and ever, I do this.
The Primal Lord, the Great Giver, has blessed me with the gift of fearlessness. Joining the Company of the Holy, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||
My tongue is imbued with the Praises of the inaccessible and unfathomable Lord, and my eyes are drenched with the Blessed Vision of His Darshan.
Be Merciful to me, O Destroyer of the pains of the meek, that I may enshrine Your Lotus Feet within my heart. ||2||
Beneath all, and above all; this is the vision I saw.
I have destroyed, destroyed, destroyed my pride, since the True Guru implanted His Mantra within me. ||3||
Immeasurable, immeasurable, immeasurable is the Merciful Lord; he cannot be weighed. He is the Lover of His devotees.
Whoever enters the Sanctuary of Guru Nanak, is blessed with the gifts of fearlessness and peace. ||4||||1||81||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
O Dear God, You are the Support of my breath of life.
I how in humility and reverence to You; so many times, I am a sacrifice. ||1||Pause||
Sitting down, standing up, sleeping and waking, this mind thinks of You.
I describe to You my pleasure and pain, and the state of this mind. ||1||
You are my shelter and support, power, intellect and wealth; You are my family.
Whatever You do, I know that is good. Gazing upon Your Lotus Feet, Nanak is at peace. ||2||2||82||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
I have heard that God is the Savior of all.
Intoxicated by attachment, in the company of sinners, the mortal has forgotten such a Lord from his mind. ||1||Pause||
He has collected poison, and grasped it firmly. But he has cast out the Ambrosial Nectar from his mind.
He is imbued with sexual desire, anger, greed and slander; he has abandoned truth and contentment. ||1||
Lift me up, and pull me out of these, O my Lord and Master. I have entered Your Sanctuary.
Nanak prays to God: I am a poor beggar; carry me across, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||2||3||83||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
I listen to God's Teachings from the Saints.
The Lord's Sermon, the Kirtan of His Praises and the songs of bliss perfectly resonate, day and night. ||1||Pause||
In His Mercy, God has made them His own, and blessed them with the gift of His Name.
Twenty-four hours a day, I sing the Glorious Praises of God. Sexual desire and anger have left this body. ||1||
