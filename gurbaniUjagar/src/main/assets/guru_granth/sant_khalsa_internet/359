One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The five evil passions dwell hidden within the mind.
They do not remain still, but move around like wanderers. ||1||
My soul does not stay held by the Merciful Lord.
It is greedy, deceitful, sinful and hypocritical, and totally attached to Maya. ||1||Pause||
I will decorate my neck with garlands of flowers.
When I meet my Beloved, then I will put on my decorations. ||2||
I have five companions and one Spouse.
It is ordained from the very beginning, that the soul must ultimately depart. ||3||
The five companions will lament together.
When the soul is trapped, prays Nanak, it is called to account. ||4||1||34||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Aasaa, Sixth House, First Mehl:
If the pearl of the mind is strung like a jewel on the thread of the breath,
and the soul-bride adorns her body with compassion, then the Beloved Lord will enjoy His lovely bride. ||1||
O my Love, I am fascinated by Your many glories;
Your Glorious Virtues are not found in any other. ||1||Pause||
If the bride wears the garland of the Lord's Name, Har, Har, around her neck, and if she uses the toothbrush of the Lord;
and if she fashions and wears the bracelet of the Creator Lord around her wrist, then she shall hold her consciousness steady. ||2||
She should make the Lord, the Slayer of demons, her ring, and take the Transcendent Lord as her silken clothes.
The soul-bride should weave patience into the braids of her hair, and apply the lotion of the Lord, the Great Lover. ||3||
If she lights the lamp in the mansion of her mind, and makes her body the bed of the Lord,
then, when the King of spiritual wisdom comes to her bed, He shall take her, and enjoy her. ||4||1||35||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
The created being acts as he is made to act; what can be said to him, O Siblings of Destiny?
Whatever the Lord is to do, He is doing; what cleverness could be used to affect Him? ||1||
The Order of Your Will is so sweet, O Lord; this is pleasing to You.
O Nanak, he alone is honored with greatness, who is absorbed in the True Name. ||1||Pause||
The deeds are done according to pre-ordained destiny; no one can turn back this Order.
As it is written, so it comes to pass; no one can erase it. ||2||
He who talks on and on in the Lord's Court is known as a joker.
He is not successful in the game of chess, and his chessmen do not reach their goal. ||3||
By himself, no one is literate, learned or wise; no one is ignorant or evil.
When, as a slave, one praises the Lord, only then is he known as a human being. ||4||2||36||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
Let the Word of the Guru's Shabad be the ear-rings in your mind, and wear the patched coat of tolerance.
Whatever the Lord does, look upon that as good; thus you shall obtain the treasure of Sehj Yoga. ||1||
O father, the soul which is united in union as a Yogi, remains united in the supreme essence throughout the ages.
