Fall in love, fall deeply in love with the Lord; clinging to the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, you will be exalted and embellished.
Those who accept the Word of the Guru as True, totally True, are very dear to my Lord and Master. ||6||
Because of actions committed in past lives, one comes to love the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har.
By Guru's Grace, you shall obtain the ambrosial essence; sing of this essence, and reflect upon this essence. ||7||
O Lord, Har, Har, all forms and colors are Yours; O my Beloved, my deep crimson ruby.
Only that color which You impart, Lord, exists; O Nanak, what can the poor wretched being do? ||8||3||
Nat, Fourth Mehl:
In the Sanctuary of the Guru, the Lord God saves and protects us,
as He protected the elephant, when the crocodile seized it and pulled it into the water; He lifted him up and pulled him out. ||1||Pause||
God's servants are sublime and exalted; they enshrine faith for Him in their minds.
Faith and devotion are pleasing to my God's Mind; He saves the honor of His humble servants. ||1||
The servant of the Lord, Har, Har, is committed to His service; He sees God pervading the entire expanse of the universe.
He sees the One and only Primal Lord God, who blesses all with His Glance of Grace. ||2||
God, our Lord and Master, is permeating and pervading all places; He takes care of the whole world as His slave.
The Merciful Lord Himself mercifully gives His gifts, even to worms in stones. ||3||
Within the deer is the heavy fragrance of musk, but he is confused and deluded, and he shakes his horns looking for it.
Wandering, rambling and roaming through the forests and woods, I exhausted myself, and then in my own home, the Perfect Guru saved me. ||4||
The Word, the Bani is Guru, and Guru is the Bani. Within the Bani, the Ambrosial Nectar is contained.
If His humble servant believes, and acts according to the Words of the Guru's Bani, then the Guru, in person, emancipates him. ||5||
All is God, and God is the whole expanse; man eats what he has planted.
When Dhrishtabudhi tormented the humble devotee Chandrahaans, he only set his own house on fire. ||6||
God's humble servant longs for Him within his heart; God watches over each breath of His humble servant.
Mercifully, mercifully, He implants devotion within his humble servant; for his sake, God saves the whole world. ||7||
God, our Lord and Master, is Himself by Himself; God Himself embellishes the universe.
O servant Nanak, He Himself is all-pervading; in His Mercy, He Himself emancipates all. ||8||4||
Nat, Fourth Mehl:
Grant Your Grace, Lord, and save me,
as You saved Dropadi from shame when she was seized and brought before the court by the evil villains. ||1||Pause||
Bless me with Your Grace - I am just a humble beggar of Yours; I beg for a single blessing, O my Beloved.
I long constantly for the True Guru. Lead me to meet the Guru, O Lord, that I may be exalted and embellished. ||1||
The actions of the faithless cynic are like the churning of water; he churns, constantly churning only water.
Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, the supreme status is obtained; the butter is produced, and eaten with delight. ||2||
He may constantly and continually wash his body; he may constantly rub, clean and polish his body.
