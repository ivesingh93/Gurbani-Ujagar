The True Lord is Nanak's strength, honor and support; He alone is his protection. ||4||2||20||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
Wandering and roaming around, I met the Holy Perfect Guru, who has taught me.
All other devices did not work, so I meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||
For this reason, I sought the Protection and Support of my Lord, the Cherisher of the Universe.
I sought the Sanctuary of the Perfect Transcendent Lord, and all my entanglements were dissolved. ||Pause||
Paradise, the earth, the nether regions of the underworld, and the globe of the world - all are engrossed in Maya.
To save your soul, and liberate all your ancestors, meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||2||
O Nanak, singing the Naam, the Name of the Immaculate Lord, all treasures are obtained.
Only that rare person, whom the Lord and Master blesses with His Grace, comes to know this. ||3||3||21||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl, Second House, Chau-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
You shall have to abandon the straw which you have collected.
These entanglements shall be of no use to you.
You are in love with those things that will not go with you.
You think that your enemies are friends. ||1||
In such confusion, the world has gone astray.
The foolish mortal wastes this precious human life. ||Pause||
He does not like to see Truth and righteousness.
He is attached to falsehood and deception; they seem sweet to him.
He loves gifts, but he forgets the Giver.
The wretched creature does not even think of death. ||2||
He cries for the possessions of others.
He forfeits all the merits of his good deeds and religion.
He does not understand the Hukam of the Lord's Command, and so he continues coming and going in reincarnation.
He sins, and then regrets and repents. ||3||
Whatever pleases You, Lord, that alone is acceptable.
I am a sacrifice to Your Will.
Poor Nanak is Your slave, Your humble servant.
Save me, O my Lord God Master! ||4||1||22||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
I am meek and poor; the Name of God is my only Support.
The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is my occupation and earnings.
I gather only the Lord's Name.
It is useful in both this world and the next. ||1||
Imbued with the Love of the Lord God's Infinite Name,
the Holy Saints sing the Glorious Praises of the One Lord, the Formless Lord. ||Pause||
The Glory of the Holy Saints comes from their total humility.
The Saints realize that their greatness rests in the Praises of the Lord.
Meditating on the Lord of the Universe, the Saints are in bliss.
The Saints find peace, and their anxieties are dispelled. ||2||
Wherever the Holy Saints gather,
there they sing the Praises of the Lord, in music and poetry.
In the Society of the Saints, there is bliss and peace.
They alone obtain this Society, upon whose foreheads such destiny is written. ||3||
With my palms pressed together, I offer my prayer.
I wash their feet, and chant the Praises of the Lord, the treasure of virtue.
O God, merciful and compassionate, let me remain in Your Presence.
Nanak lives, in the dust of the Saints. ||4||2||23||
