By my past actions, I have found the Lord, the Greatest Lover. Separated from Him for so long, I am united with Him again.
Inside and out, He is pervading everywhere. Faith in Him has welled up within my mind.
Nanak gives this advice: O beloved mind, let the Society of the Saints be your dwelling. ||4||
O dear beloved mind, my friend, let your mind remain absorbed in loving devotion to the Lord.
O dear beloved mind, my friend, the fish of the mind lives only when it is immersed in the Water of the Lord.
Drinking in the Lord's Ambrosial Bani, the mind is satisfied, and all pleasures come to abide within.
Attaining the Lord of Excellence, I sing the Songs of Joy. The True Guru, becoming merciful, has fulfilled my desires.
He has attached me to the hem of His robe, and I have obtained the nine treasures. My Lord and Master has bestowed His Name, which is everything to me.
Nanak instructs the Saints to teach, that the mind is imbued with loving devotion to the Lord. ||5||1||2||
Chhants Of Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Dakhanaa:
My Beloved Husband Lord is deep within my heart. How can I see Him?
In the Sanctuary of the Saints, O Nanak, the Support of the breath of life is found. ||1||
Chhant:
To love the Lotus Feet of the Lord-this way of life has come into the minds of His Saints.
The love of duality, this evil practice, this bad habit, is not liked by the Lord's slaves.
It is not pleasing to the Lord's slaves; without the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, how can they find peace, even for a moment?
Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the body and mind are empty; like fish out of water, they die.
Please meet with me, O my Beloved-You are the Support of my breath of life. Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I sing Your Glorious Praises.
O Lord and Master of Nanak, please grant Your Grace, and permeate my body, mind and being. ||1||
Dakhanaa:
He is Beautiful in all places; I do not see any other at all.
Meeting with the True Guru, O Nanak, the doors are opened wide. ||1||
Chhant:
Your Word is Incomparable and Infinite. I contemplate the Word of Your Bani, the Support of the Saints.
I remember Him in meditation with every breath and morsel of food, with perfect faith. How could I forget Him from my mind?
How could I forget Him from my mind, even for an instant? He is the Most Worthy; He is my very life!
My Lord and Master is the Giver of the fruits of the mind's desires. He knows all the useless vanities and pains of the soul.
Meditating on the Patron of lost souls, the Companion of all, your life shall not be lost in the gamble.
Nanak offers this prayer to God: Please shower me with Your Mercy, and carry me across the terrifying world-ocean. ||2||
Dakhanaa:
People bathe in the dust of the feet of the Saints, when the Lord becomes merciful.
I have obtained all things, O Nanak; the Lord is my Wealth and Property. ||1||
Chhant:
My Lord and Master's Home is beautiful. It is the resting place of His devotees, who live in hopes of attaining it.
Their minds and bodies are absorbed in meditation on the Name of God; they drink in the Lord's Ambrosial Nectar.
