Without meditating in remembrance on the Lord, life is like a burning fire, even if one lives long, like a snake.
One may rule over the nine regions of the earth, but in the end, he shall have to depart, losing the game of life. ||1||
He alone sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, the treasure of virtue, upon whom the Lord showers His Grace.
He is at peace, and his birth is blessed; Nanak is a sacrifice to him. ||2||2||
Todee, Fifth Mehl, Second House, Chau-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The mind wanders, wandering in the ten directions.
It is intoxicated by Maya, enticed by the taste of greed. God Himself has deluded it. ||Pause||
He does not focus his mind, even for a moment, on the Lord's sermon, or the Lord's Praises, or the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
He is excited, gazing on the transitory color of the safflower, and looking at other men's wives. ||1||
He does not love the Lord's lotus feet, and he does not please the True Lord.
He runs around chasing the fleeting objects of the world, in all directions, like the ox around the oil press. ||2||
He does not practice the Naam, the Name of the Lord; nor does he practice charity or inner cleansing.
He does not sing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises, even for an instant. Clinging to his many falsehoods, he does not please his own mind, and he does not understand his own self. ||3||
He never does good deeds for others; he does not serve or meditate on the True Guru.
He is entangled in the company and the advice of the five demons, intoxicated by the wine of Maya. ||4||
I offer my prayer in the Saadh Sangat; hearing that the Lord is the Lover of His devotees, I have come.
Nanak runs after the Lord, and pleads, "Protect my honor, Lord, and make me Your own". ||5||1||3||
Todee, Fifth Mehl:
Without understanding, his coming into the world is useless.
He puts on various ornaments and many decorations, but it is like dressing a corpse. ||Pause||
With great effort and exertion, the miser works to gather in the riches of Maya.
He does not give anything in charity or generosity, and he does not serve the Saints; his wealth does not do him any good at all. ||1||
The soul-bride puts on her ornaments, embellishes her bed, and fashions decorations.
But if she does not obtain the company of her Husband Lord, the sight of these decorations only brings her pain. ||2||
The man works all day long, threshing the husks with the pestle.
He is depressed, like a forced laborer, and so he is of no use to his own home. ||3||
But when God shows His Mercy and Grace, He implants the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within the heart.
Search the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O Nanak, and find the sublime essence of the Lord. ||4||2||4||
Todee, Fifth Mehl:
O Lord, ocean of mercy, please abide forever in my heart.
Please awaken such understanding within me, that I may be in love with You, God. ||Pause||
Please, bless me with the dust of the feet of Your slaves; I touch it to my forehead.
I was a great sinner, but I have been made pure, singing the Kirtan of the Lord's Glorious Praises. ||1||
