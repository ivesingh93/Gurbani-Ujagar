Many come and go; they die, and dIE again, and are reincarnated.
Without understanding, they are totally useless, and they wander in reincarnation. ||5||
They alone join the Saadh Sangat, unto whom the Lord becomes Merciful.
They chant and meditate on the Ambrosial Name of the Lord. ||6||
Uncounted millions, so many they are endless, search for Him.
But only that one, who understands his own self, sees God near at hand. ||7||
Never forget me, O Great Giver - please bless me with Your Naam.
To sing Your Glorious Praises day and night - O Nanak, this is my heart-felt desire. ||8||2||5||16||
Raag Soohee, First Mehl, Kuchajee ~ The Ungraceful Bride:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
I am ungraceful and ill-mannered, full of endless faults. How can I go to enjoy my Husband Lord?
Each of His soul-brides is better than the rest - who even knows my name?
Those brides who enjoy their Husband Lord are very blessed, resting in the shade of the mango tree.
I do not have their virtue - who can I blame for this?
Which of Your Virtues, O Lord, should I speak of? Which of Your Names should I chant?
I cannot even reach one of Your Virtues. I am forever a sacrifice to You.
Gold, silver, pearls and rubies are pleasing.
My Husband Lord has blessed me with these things, and I have focused my thoughts on them.
Palaces of brick and mud are built and decorated with stones;
I have been fooled by these decorations, and I do not sit near my Husband Lord.
The cranes shriek overhead in the sky, and the herons have come to rest.
The bride has gone to her father-in-law's house; in the world hereafter, what face will she show?
She kept sleeping as the day dawned; she forgot all about her journey.
She separated herself from her Husband Lord, and now she suffers in pain.
Virtue is in You, O Lord; I am totally without virtue. This is Nanak's only prayer:
You give all Your nights to the virtuous soul-brides. I know I am unworthy, but isn't there a night for me as well? ||1||
Soohee, First Mehl, Suchajee ~ The Noble And Graceful Bride:
When I have You, then I have everything. O my Lord and Master, You are my wealth and capital.
Within You, I abide in peace; within You, I am congratulated.
By the Pleasure of Your Will, You bestow thrones and greatness. And by the Pleasure of Your Will, You make us beggars and wanderers.
By the Pleasure of Your Will, the ocean flows in the desert, and the lotus blossoms in the sky.
By the Pleasure of Your Will, one crosses over the terrifying world-ocean; by the Pleasure of Your Will, he sinks down into it.
By the Pleasure of His Will, that Lord becomes my Husband, and I am imbued with the Praises of the Lord, the treasure of virtue.
By the Pleasure of Your Will, O my Husband Lord, I am afraid of You, and I come and go, and die.
You, O my Husband Lord, are inaccessible and immeasurable; talking and speaking of You, I have fallen at Your Feet.
What should I beg for? What should I say and hear? I am hungry and thirsty for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.
Through the Word of the Guru's Teachings, I have found my Husband Lord. This is Nanak's true prayer. ||2||
