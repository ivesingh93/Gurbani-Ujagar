I think thoughts of Him; I miss the Love of my Beloved. When will I obtain the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan?
I try, but this mind is not encouraged. Is there any Saint who can lead me to God? ||1||
Chanting, penance, self-control, good deeds and charity - I sacrifice all these in fire; I dedicate all peace and places to Him.
One who helps me to behold the Blessed Vision of my Beloved, for even an instant - I am a sacrifice to that Saint. ||2||
I offer all my prayers and entreaties to him; I serve him, day and night.
I have renounced all pride and egotism; he tells me the stories of my Beloved. ||3||
I am wonder-struck, gazing upon the wondrous play of God. The Guru, the True Guru, has led me to meet the Primal Lord.
I have found God, my Merciful Loving Lord, within the home of my own heart. O Nanak, the fire within me has been quenched. ||4||1||15||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
You fool, why are you not meditating on the Lord now?
In the awful hell of the fire of the womb, you did penance, upside-down; each and every instant, you sang His Glorious Praises. ||1||Pause||
You wandered through countless incarnations, until finally you attained this priceless human birth.
Leaving the womb, you were born, and when you came out, you became attached to other places. ||1||
You practiced evil and fraud day and night, and did useless deeds.
You thrash the straw, but it has no wheat; running around and hurrying, you obtain only pain. ||2||
The false person is attached to falsehood; he is entangled with transitory things.
And when the Righteous Judge of Dharma seizes you, O madman, you shall arise and depart with your face blackened. ||3||
He alone meets with God, whom God Himself meets, by such pre-ordained destiny written on his forehead.
Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to that humble being, who remains unattached within his mind. ||4||2||16||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
How can I live without my Beloved, O my mother?
Separated from Him, the mortal becomes a corpse, and is not allowed to remain within the house. ||1||Pause||
He is the Giver of the soul, the heart, the breath of life. Being with Him, we are embellished with joy.
Please bless me with Your Grace, O Saint, that I may sing the songs of joyful praise to my God. ||1||
I touch my forehead to the feet of the Saints. My eyes long for their dust.
By His Grace, we meet God; O Nanak, I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to Him. ||2||3||17||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
I am a sacrifice to that occasion.
Twenty-four hours a day, I meditate in remembrance on my God; by great good fortune, I have found the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Kabeer is good, the slave of the Lord's slaves; the humble barber Sain is sublime.
Highest of the high is Naam Dayv, who looked upon all alike; Ravi Daas was in tune with the Lord. ||1||
My soul, body and wealth belong to the Saints; my mind longs for the dust of the Saints.
And by the radiant Grace of the Saints, all my doubts have been erased. O Nanak, I have met the Lord. ||2||4||18||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
The True Guru fulfills the mind's desires.
