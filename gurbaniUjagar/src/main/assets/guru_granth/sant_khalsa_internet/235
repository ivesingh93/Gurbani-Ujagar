If the Lord Himself saves you, then you shall be saved. Dwell upon the Feet of the True Guru. ||4||
O my dear beloved camel-like mind, dwell upon the Divine Light within the body.
The Guru has shown me the nine treasures of the Naam. The Merciful Lord has bestowed this gift. ||5||
O camel-like mind, you are so fickle; give up your cleverness and corruption.
Dwell upon the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; at the very last moment, the Lord shall liberate you. ||6||
O camel-like mind, you are so very fortunate; dwell upon the jewel of spiritual wisdom.
You hold in your hands the sword of the Guru's spiritual wisdom; with this destroyer of death, kill the Messenger of Death. ||7||
The treasure is deep within, O camel-like mind, but you wander around outside in doubt, searching for it.
Meeting the Perfect Guru, the Primal Being, you shall discover that the Lord, your Best Friend, is with you. ||8||
You are engrossed in pleasures, O camel-like mind; dwell upon the Lord's lasting love instead!
The color of the Lord's Love never fades away; serve the Guru, and dwell upon the Word of the Shabad. ||9||
We are birds, O camel-like mind; the Lord, the Immortal Primal Being, is the tree.
The Gurmukhs are very fortunate - they find it. O servant Nanak, dwell upon the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||10||2||
Raag Gauree Gwaarayree, Fifth Mehl, Ashtapadees:
One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. By Guru's Grace:
When this mind is filled with pride,
then it wanders around like a madman and a lunatic.
But when it becomes the dust of all,
then it recognizes the Lord in each and every heart. ||1||
The fruit of humility is intuitive peace and pleasure.
My True Guru has given me this gift. ||1||Pause||
When he believes others to be bad,
then everyone lays traps for him.
But when he stops thinking in terms of 'mine' and 'yours',
then no one is angry with him. ||2||
When he clings to 'my own, my own',
then he is in deep trouble.
But when he recognizes the Creator Lord,
then he is free of torment. ||3||
When he entangles himself in emotional attachment,
he comes and goes in reincarnation, under the constant gaze of Death.
But when all his doubts are removed,
then there is no difference between him and the Supreme Lord God. ||4||
When he perceives differences,
then he suffers pain, punishment and sorrow.
But when he recognizes the One and Only Lord,
he understands everything. ||5||
When he runs around for the sake of Maya and riches,
he is not satisfied, and his desires are not quenched.
But when he runs away from Maya,
then the Goddess of Wealth gets up and follows him. ||6||
When, by His Grace, the True Guru is met,
the lamp is lit within the temple of the mind.
When he realizes what victory and defeat really are,
then he comes to appreciate the true value of his own home. ||7||
