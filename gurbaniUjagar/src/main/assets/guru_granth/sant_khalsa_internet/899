God killed the five tigers.
He has driven out the ten wolves.
The three whirl-pools have stopped spinning.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the fear of reincarnation is gone. ||1||
Meditating, meditating in remembrance on the Lord of the Universe, I live.
In His Mercy, He protects His slave; the True Lord is forever and ever the forgiver. ||1||Pause||
The mountain of sin is burnt down, like straw,
by chanting and meditating on the Name, and worshipping God's feet.
God, the embodiment of bliss, becomes manifest everywhere.
Linked to His loving devotional worship, I enjoy peace. ||2||
I have crossed over the world-ocean, as if it were no bigger than a calf's footprint on the ground.
I shall never again have to endure suffering or grief.
The ocean is contained in the pitcher.
This is not such an amazing thing for the Creator to do. ||3||
When I am separated from Him, then I am consigned to the nether regions.
When He lifts me up and pulls me out, then I am enraptured by His Glance of Grace.
Vice and virtue are not under my control.
With love and affection, Nanak sings His Glorious Praises. ||4||40||51||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
Neither your body nor your mind belong to you.
Attached to Maya, you are entangled in fraud.
You play like a baby lamb.
But suddenly, Death will catch you in its noose. ||1||
Seek the Sanctuary of the Lord's lotus feet, O my mind.
Chant the Name of the Lord, which will be your help and support. As Gurmukh, you shall obtain the true wealth. ||1||Pause||
Your unfinished worldly affairs will never be resolved.
You shall always regret your sexual desire, anger and pride.
You act in corruption in order to survive,
but not even an iota will go along with you, you ignorant fool! ||2||
You practice deception, and you know many tricks;
for the sake of mere shells, you throw dust upon your head.
You never even think of the One who gave you life.
The pain of false greed never leaves you. ||3||
When the Supreme Lord God becomes merciful,
this mind becomes the dust of the feet of the Holy.
With His lotus hands, He has attached us to the hem of His robe.
Nanak merges in the Truest of the True. ||4||41||52||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
I seek the Sanctuary of the Sovereign Lord.
I have become fearless, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, my pains have been taken away. ||1||Pause||
That person, within whose mind the Lord abides,
does not see the impassible world-ocean.
All one's affairs are resolved,
by chanting continually the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||
The Guru places His hand upon whos forehead,
why should that slave of Him feel any anxiety?.
The fear of birth and death is dispelled;
I am a sacrifice to the Perfect Guru. ||2||
I am enraptured, meeting with the Guru, the Transcendent Lord.
He alone obtains the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, who is blessed by His Mercy.
One who is blessed by the Grace of the Supreme Lord God,
crosses over the terrifying world-ocean in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||3||
Drink in the Ambrosial Nectar, O Beloved Holy people.
Your face shall be radiant and bright in the Court of the Lord.
Celebrate and be blissful, and abandon all corruption.
O Nanak, meditate on the Lord and cross over. ||4||42||53||
