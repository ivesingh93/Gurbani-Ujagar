He is blended with God, by dedicating his mind to Him.
Bless Nanak with Your Name, O Lord - please, shower Your Mercy upon him! ||2||1||150||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Please, come to me, O Beloved Lord; without You, no one can comfort me. ||1||Pause||
One may read the Simritees and the Shaastras, and perform all sorts of religious rituals; and yet, without the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, God, there is no peace at all. ||1||
People have grown weary of observing fasts, vows and rigorous self-discipline; Nanak abides with God, in the Sanctuary of the Saints. ||2||2||151||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Fifteenth House, Partaal:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
He sleeps, intoxicated by corruption and Maya; he does not come to realize or understand.
Seizing him by the hair, the Messenger of Death pulls him up; then, he comes to his senses. ||1||
Those who are attached to the poison of greed and sin grab at the wealth of others; they only bring pain on themselves.
They are intoxicated by their pride in those things which shall be destroyed in an instant; those demons do not understand. ||1||Pause||
The Vedas, the Shaastras and the holy men proclaim it, but the deaf do not hear it.
When the game of life is over, and he has lost, and he breathes his last, then the fool regrets and repents in his mind. ||2||
He paid the fine, but it is in vain - in the Court of the Lord, his account is not credited.
Those deeds which would have covered him - those deeds, he has not done. ||3||
The Guru has shown me the world to be thus; I sing the Kirtan of the Praises of the One Lord.
Renouncing his pride in strength and cleverness, Nanak has come to the Lord's Sanctuary. ||4||1||152||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Dealing in the Name of the Lord of the Universe,
and pleasing the Saints and holy men, obtain the Beloved Lord and sing His Glorious Praises; play the sound current of the Naad with the five instruments. ||1||Pause||
Obtaining His Mercy, I easily gained the Blessed Vision of His Darshan; now, I am imbued with the Love of the Lord of the Universe.
Serving the Saints, I feel love and affection for my Beloved Lord Master. ||1||
The Guru has implanted spiritual wisdom within my mind, and I rejoice that I shall not have to come back again. I have obtained celestial poise, and the treasure within my mind.
I have renounced all of the affairs of my mind's desires.
It has been so long, so long, so long, so very long, since my mind has felt such a great thirst.
Please, reveal to me the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, and show Yourself to me.
Nanak the meek has entered Your Sanctuary; please, take me in Your embrace. ||2||2||153||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Who can destroy the fortress of sin,
and release me from hope, thirst, deception, attachment and doubt? ||1||Pause||
How can I escape the afflictions of sexual desire, anger, greed and pride? ||1||
In the Society of the Saints, love the Naam, and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe.
Night and day, meditate on God.
I have captured and demolished the walls of doubt.
O Nanak, the Naam is my only treasure. ||2||3||154||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Renounce sexual desire, anger and greed;
remember the Name of the Lord of the Universe in your mind.
Meditation on the Lord is the only fruitful action. ||1||Pause||
