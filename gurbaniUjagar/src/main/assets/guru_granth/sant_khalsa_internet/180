The mortal claims this body as his own.
Again and again, he clings to it.
He is entangled with his children, his wife and household affairs.
He cannot be the slave of the Lord. ||1||
What is that way, by which the Lord's Praises might be sung?
What is that intellect, by which this person might swim across, O mother? ||1||Pause||
That which is for his own good, he thinks is evil.
If someone tells him the truth, he looks upon that as poison.
He cannot tell victory from defeat.
This is the way of life in the world of the faithless cynic. ||2||
The demented fool drinks in the deadly poison,
while he believes the Ambrosial Naam to be bitter.
He does not even approach the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy;
he wanders lost through 8.4 million incarnations. ||3||
The birds are caught in the net of Maya;
immersed in the pleasures of love, they frolic in so many ways.
Says Nanak, unto whom the Lord has shown His Mercy,
the Perfect Guru has cut away the noose of those. ||4||13||82||
Gauree Gwaarayree, Fifth Mehl:
By Your Grace, we find the Way.
By God's Grace, we meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
By God's Grace, we are released from our bondage.
By Your Grace, egotism is eradicated. ||1||
As You assign me, so I take to Your service.
By myself, I cannot do anything at all, O Divine Lord. ||1||Pause||
If it pleases You, then I sing the Word of Your Bani.
If it pleases You, then I speak the Truth.
If it pleases You, then the True Guru showers His Mercy upon me.
All peace comes by Your Kindness, God. ||2||
Whatever pleases You is a pure action of karma.
Whatever pleases You is the true faith of Dharma.
The treasure of all excellence is with You.
Your servant prays to You, O Lord and Master. ||3||
The mind and body become immaculate through the Lord's Love.
All peace is found in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation.
My mind remains attuned to Your Name;
Nanak affirms this as his greatest pleasure. ||4||14||83||
Gauree Gwaarayree, Fifth Mehl:
You may taste the other flavors,
but your thirst shall not depart, even for an instant.
But when you taste the sweet flavor the Lord's sublime essence -
upon tasting it, you shall be wonder-struck and amazed. ||1||
O dear beloved tongue, drink in the Ambrosial Nectar.
Imbued with this sublime essence, you shall be satisfied. ||1||Pause||
O tongue, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
Each and every moment, meditate on the Lord, Har, Har, Har.
Do not listen to any other, and do not go anywhere else.
By great good fortune, you shall find the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||2||
O tongue, dwell upon God, twenty-four hours a day,
the Unfathomable, Supreme Lord and Master.
Here and hereafter, you shall be happy forever.
Chanting the Glorious Praises of the Lord, O tongue, you shall become priceless. ||3||
All the vegetation will blossom forth for you, flowering in fruition;
imbued with this sublime essence, you shall never leave it again.
No other sweet and tasty flavors can compare to it.
Says Nanak, the Guru has become my Support. ||4||15||84||
Gauree Gwaarayree, Fifth Mehl:
The mind is the temple, and the body is the fence built around it.
