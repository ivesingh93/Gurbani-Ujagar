Those who wander around, deluded by doubt, are called manmukhs; they are neither on this side, nor on the other side. ||3||
That humble being, who is blessed by the Lord's Glance of Grace obtains Him, and contemplates the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
In the midst of Maya, the Lord's servant is emancipated.
O Nanak, one who has such destiny inscribed upon his forehead, conquers and destroys death. ||4||1||
Bilaaval, Third Mehl:
How can the unweighable be weighed?
If there is anyone else as great, then he alone could understand the Lord.
There is no other than Him.
How can His value be estimated? ||1||
By Guru's Grace, He comes to dwell in the mind.
One comes to know Him, when duality departs. ||1||Pause||
He Himself is the Assayer, applying the touch-stone to test it.
He Himself analyzes the coin, and He Himself approves it as currency.
He Himself weights it perfectly.
He alone knows; He is the One and Only Lord. ||2||
All the forms of Maya emanate from Him.
He alone becomes pure and immaculate, who is united with the Lord.
He alone is attached, whom the Lord attaches.
All Truth is revealed to him, and then, he merges in the True Lord. ||3||
He Himself leads the mortals to focus on Him, and He Himself causes them to chase after Maya.
He Himself imparts understanding, and He reveals Himself.
He Himself is the True Guru, and He Himself is the Word of the Shabad.
O Nanak, He Himself speaks and teaches. ||4||2||
Bilaaval, Third Mehl:
My Lord and Master has made me His servant, and blessed me with His service; how can anyone argue about this?
Such is Your play, One and Only Lord; You are the One, contained among all. ||1||
When the True Guru is pleased and appeased, one is absorbed in the Lord's Name.
One who is blessed by the Lord's Mercy, finds the True Guru; night and day, he automatically remains focused on the Lord's meditation. ||1||Pause||
How can I serve You? How can I be proud of this?
When You withdraw Your Light, O Lord and Master, then who can speak and teach? ||2||
You Yourself are the Guru, and You Yourself are the chaylaa, the humble disciple; You Yourself are the treasure of virtue.
As You cause us to move, so do we move, according to the Pleasure of Your Will, O Lord God. ||3||
Says Nanak, You are the True Lord and Master; who can know Your actions?
Some are blessed with glory in their own homes, while others wander in doubt and pride. ||4||3||
Bilaaval, Third Mehl:
The perfect Lord has fashioned the Perfect Creation. Behold the Lord pervading everywhere.
In this play of the world, is the glorious greatness of the True Name. No one should take pride in himself. ||1||
One who accepts the wisdom of the True Guru's Teachings, is absorbed into the True Guru.
The Lord's Name abides deep within the nucleus of one who realizes the Bani of the Guru's Word within his soul. ||1||Pause||
Now, this is the essence of the teachings of the four ages: for the human race, the Name of the One Lord is the greatest treasure.
Celibacy, self-discipline and pilgrimages were the essence of Dharma in those past ages; but in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Praise of the Lord's Name is the essence of Dharma. ||2||
Each and every age has its own essence of Dharma; study the Vedas and the Puraanas, and see this as true.
They are Gurmukh, who meditate on the Lord, Har, Har; in this world, they are perfect and approved. ||3||
