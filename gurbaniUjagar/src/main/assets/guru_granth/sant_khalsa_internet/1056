For the sake of poison, they act in greed and possessiveness, and evil-minded duality. ||9||
The Perfect True Guru implants devotional worship within.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he lovingly centers his consciousness on the Lord's Name.
The Lord pervades his mind, body and heart; deep within, his mind is drenched with devotional worship and praise of the Lord. ||10||
My True Lord God is the Destroyer of demons.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, His devotees are saved.
My True Lord God is forever True. He is the Emperor over the heads of kings. ||11||
True are those devotees, who are pleasing to Your Mind.
They sing the Kirtan of His Praises at His Door; they are embellished and exalted by the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Night and day, they sing the True Word of His Bani. The Naam is the wealth of the poor. ||12||
Those whom You unite, Lord, are never separated again.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they praise You forever.
You are the One Lord and Master over all. Through the Shabad, the Naam is praised. ||13||
Without the Shabad, no one knows You.
You Yourself speak the Unspoken Speech.
You Yourself are the Shabad forever, the Guru, the Great Giver; chanting the Lord's Name, You bestow Your treasure. ||14||
You Yourself are the Creator of the Universe.
No one can erase what You have written.
You Yourself bless the Gurmukh with the Naam, who is no longer skeptical, and is not held to account. ||15||
Your true devotees stand at the Door of Your Court.
They serve the Shabad with love and affection.
O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Naam remain detached; through the Naam, their affairs are resolved. ||16||3||12||
Maaroo, Third Mehl:
My True Lord God has staged a play.
He has created no one like anyone else.
He made them different, and he gazes upon them with pleasure; he placed all the flavors in the body. ||1||
You Yourself vibrate the beat of the breath.
Shiva and Shakti, energy and matter - You have placed them into the body.
By Guru's Grace, one turns away from the world, and attains the jewel of spiritual wisdom, and the Word of the Shabad. ||2||
He Himself created darkness and light.
He alone is pervasive; there is no other at all.
One who realizes his own self - by Guru's Grace, the lotus of his mind blossoms forth. ||3||
Only He Himself knows His depth and extent.
Other people can only listen and hear what is spoken and said.
One who is spiritually wise, understands himself as Gurmukh; he praises the True Lord. ||4||
Deep within the body is the priceless object.
He Himself opens the doors.
The Gurmukh intuitively drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar, and the fire of desire is quenched. ||5||
He placed all the flavors within the body.
How rare are those who understand, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
So search within yourself, and praise the Shabad. Why run around outside your self? ||6||
Without tasting, no one enjoys the flavor.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, one drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar.
The Ambrosial Nectar is drunk, and the immoral status is obtained, when one obtains the sublime essence of the Guru's Shabad. ||7||
One who realizes himself, knows all virtues.
