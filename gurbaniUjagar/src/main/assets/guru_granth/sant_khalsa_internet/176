He is pleased at the sight of his elephants and horses
and his armies assembled, his servants and his soldiers.
But the noose of egotism is tightening around his neck. ||2||
His rule may extend in all ten directions;
he may revel in pleasures, and enjoy many women -
but he is just a beggar, who in his dream, is a king. ||3||
The True Guru has shown me that there is only one pleasure.
Whatever the Lord does, is pleasing to the Lord's devotee.
Servant Nanak has abolished his ego, and he is absorbed in the Lord. ||4||
This is the way to find happiness, O my Siblings of Destiny.
This is the way to find the Lord, our Help and Support. ||1||Second. Pause||
Gauree Gwaarayree, Fifth Mehl:
Why do you doubt? What do you doubt?
God is pervading the water, the land and the sky.
The Gurmukhs are saved, while the self-willed manmukhs lose their honor. ||1||
One who is protected by the Merciful Lord -
no one else can rival him. ||1||Pause||
The Infinite One is pervading among all.
So sleep in peace, and don't worry.
He knows everything which happens. ||2||
The self-willed manmukhs are dying in the thirst of duality.
They wander lost through countless incarnations; this is their pre-ordained destiny.
As they plant, so shall they harvest. ||3||
Beholding the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, my mind has blossomed forth.
And now everywhere I look, God is revealed to me.
Servant Nanak's hopes have been fulfilled by the Lord. ||4||2||71||
Gauree Gwaarayree, Fifth Mehl:
In so many incarnations, you were a worm and an insect;
in so many incarnations, you were an elephant, a fish and a deer.
In so many incarnations, you were a bird and a snake.
In so many incarnations, you were yoked as an ox and a horse. ||1||
Meet the Lord of the Universe - now is the time to meet Him.
After so very long, this human body was fashioned for you. ||1||Pause||
In so many incarnations, you were rocks and mountains;
in so many incarnations, you were aborted in the womb;
in so many incarnations, you developed branches and leaves;
you wandered through 8.4 million incarnations. ||2||
Through the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, you obtained this human life.
Do seva - selfless service; follow the Guru's Teachings, and vibrate the Lord's Name, Har, Har.
Abandon pride, falsehood and arrogance.
Remain dead while yet alive, and you shall be welcomed in the Court of the Lord. ||3||
Whatever has been, and whatever shall be, comes from You, Lord.
No one else can do anything at all.
We are united with You, when You unite us with Yourself.
Says Nanak, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, Har, Har. ||4||3||72||
Gauree Gwaarayree, Fifth Mehl:
In the field of karma, plant the seed of the Naam.
Your works shall be brought to fruition.
You shall obtain these fruits, and the fear of death shall be dispelled.
Sing continually the Glorious Praises of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||
Keep the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, enshrined in your heart,
and your affairs shall be quickly resolved. ||1||Pause||
Be always attentive to your God;
thus you shall be honored in His Court.
