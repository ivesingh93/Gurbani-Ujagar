I say to you, O my body: listen to my advice!
You slander, and then praise others; you indulge in lies and gossip.
You gaze upon the wives of others, O my soul; you steal and commit evil deeds.
But when the swan departs, you shall remain behind, like an abandoned woman. ||2||
O body, you are living in a dream! What good deeds have you done?
When I stole something by deception, then my mind was pleased.
I have no honor in this world, and I shall find no shelter in the world hereafter. My life has been lost, wasted in vain! ||3||
I am totally miserable! O Baba Nanak, no one cares for me at all! ||1||Pause||
Turkish horses, gold, silver and loads of gorgeous clothes -
none of these shall go with you, O Nanak. They are lost and left behind, you fool!
I have tasted all the sugar candy and sweets, but Your Name alone is Ambrosial Nectar. ||4||
Digging deep foundations, the walls are constructed, but in the end, the buildings return to heaps of dust.
People gather and hoard their possessions, and give nothing to anyone else - the poor fools think that everything is theirs.
Riches do not remain with anyone - not even the golden palaces of Sri Lanka. ||5||
Listen, you foolish and ignorant mind -
only His Will prevails. ||1||Pause||
My Banker is the Great Lord and Master. I am only His petty merchant.
This soul and body all are His. He Himself kills, and brings back to life. ||6||1||13||
Gauree Chaytee, First Mehl:
There are five of them, but I am all alone. How can I protect my hearth and home, O my mind?
They are beating and plundering me over and over again; unto whom can I complain? ||1||
Chant the Name of the Supreme Lord, O my mind.
Otherwise, in the world hereafter, you will have to face the awesome and cruel army of Death. ||1||Pause||
God has erected the temple of the body; He has placed the nine doors, and the soul-bride sits within.
She enjoys the sweet play again and again, while the five demons are plundering her. ||2||
In this way, the temple is being demolished; the body is being plundered, and the soul-bride, left all alone, is captured.
Death strikes her down with his rod, the shackles are placed around her neck, and now the five have left. ||3||
The wife yearns for gold and silver, and her friends, the senses, yearn for good food.
O Nanak, she commits sins for their sake; she shall go, bound and gagged, to the City of Death. ||4||2||14||
Gauree Chaytee, First Mehl:
Let your ear-rings be those ear-rings which pierce deep within your heart. Let your body be your patched coat.
Let the five passions be disciples under your control, O begging Yogi, and make this mind your walking stick. ||1||
Thus you shall find the Way of Yoga.
There is only the One Word of the Shabad; everything else shall pass away. Let this be the fruits and roots of your mind's diet. ||1||Pause||
Some try to find the Guru by shaving their heads at the Ganges, but I have made the Guru my Ganges.
The Saving Grace of the three worlds is the One Lord and Master, but those in darkness do not remember Him. ||2||
Practicing hypocrisy and attaching your mind to worldly objects, your doubt shall never depart.
