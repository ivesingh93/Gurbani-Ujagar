Dying in the Word of the Shabad, you shall live forever, and you shall never die again.
The Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam is ever-sweet to the mind; but how few are those who obtain the Shabad. ||3||
The Great Giver keeps His Gifts in His Hand; He gives them to those with whom He is pleased.
O Nanak, imbued with the Naam, they find peace, and in the Court of the Lord, they are exalted. ||4||11||
Sorat'h, Third Mehl:
Serving the True Guru, the divine melody wells up within, and one is blessed with wisdom and salvation.
The True Name of the Lord comes to abide in the mind, and through the Name, one merges in the Name. ||1||
Without the True Guru, the whole world is insane.
The blind, self-willed manmukhs do not realize the Word of the Shabad; they are deluded by false doubts. ||Pause||
The three-faced Maya had led them astray in doubt, and they are snared by the noose of egotism.
Birth and death hang over their heads, and being reborn from the womb, they suffer in pain. ||2||
The three qualities permeate the whole world; acting in ego, it loses its honor.
But one who becomes Gurmukh comes to realize the fourth state of celestial bliss; he finds peace through the Name of the Lord. ||3||
The three qualities are all Yours, O Lord; You Yourself created them. Whatever You do, comes to pass.
O Nanak, through the Lord's Name, one is emancipated; through the Shabad, he is rid of egotism. ||4||12||
Sorat'h, Fourth Mehl, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
My Beloved Lord Himself pervades and permeates all; He Himself is, all by Himself.
My Beloved Himself is the trader in this world; He Himself is the true banker.
My Beloved Himself is the trade and the trader; He Himself is the true credit. ||1||
O mind, meditate on the Lord, Har, Har, and praise His Name.
By Guru's Grace, the Beloved, Ambrosial, unapproachable and unfathomable Lord is obtained. ||Pause||
The Beloved Himself sees and hears everything; He Himself speaks through the mouths of all beings.
The Beloved Himself leads us into the wilderness, and He Himself shows us the Way.
The Beloved Himself is Himself all-in-all; He Himself is carefree. ||2||
The Beloved Himself, all by Himself, created everything; He Himself links all to their tasks.
The Beloved Himself creates the Creation, and He Himself destroys it.
He Himself is the wharf, and He Himself is the ferryman, who ferries us across. ||3||
The Beloved Himself is the ocean, and the boat; He Himself is the Guru, the boatman who steers it
. The Beloved Himself sets sail and crosses over; He, the King, beholds His wondrous play.
The Beloved Himself is the Merciful Master; O servant Nanak, He forgives and blends with Himself. ||4||1||
Sorat'h, Fourth Mehl:
He Himself is born of the egg, from the womb, from sweat and from the earth; He Himself is the continents and all the worlds.
He Himself is the thread, and He Himself is the many beads; through His Almighty Power, He has strung the worlds.
