Raag Bhairao, Fifth Mehl, Partaal, Third House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
God is the Compassionate Cherisher. Who can count His Glorious Virtues?
Countless colors, and countless waves of joy; He is the Master of all. ||1||Pause||
Endless spiritual wisdom, endless meditations, endless chants, intense meditations and austere self-disciplines.
Countless virtues, musical notes and playful sports; countless silent sages enshrine Him in their hearts. ||1||
Countless melodies, countless instruments, countless tastes, each and every instant. Countless mistakes and countless diseases are removed by hearing His Praise.
O Nanak, serving the Infinite, Divine Lord, one earns all the rewards and merits of performing the six rituals, fasts, worship services, pilgrimages to sacred rivers, and journeys to sacred shrines. ||2||1||57||8||21||7||57||93||
Bhairao, Ashtapadees, First Mehl, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The Lord is in the soul, and the soul is in the Lord. This is realized through the Guru's Teachings.
The Ambrosial Word of the Guru's Bani is realized through the Word of the Shabad. Sorrow is dispelled, and egotism is eliminated. ||1||
O Nanak, the disease of egotism is so very deadly.
Wherever I look, I see the pain of the same disease. The Primal Lord Himself bestows the Shabad of His Word. ||1||Pause||
When the Appraiser Himself appraises the mortal, then he is not tested again.
Those who are blessed with His Grace meet with the Guru. They alone are true, who are pleasing to God. ||2||
Air, water and fire are diseased; the world with its enjoyments is diseased.
Mother, father, Maya and the body are diseased; those united with their relatives are diseased. ||3||
Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are diseased; the whole world is diseased.
Those who remember the Lord's Feet and contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad are liberated. ||4||
The seven seas are diseased, along with the rivers; the continents and the nether regions of the underworlds are full of disease.
The people of the Lord dwell in Truth and peace; He blesses them with His Grace everywhere. ||5||
The six Shaastras are diseased, as are the many who follow the different religious orders.
What can the poor Vedas and Bibles do? People do not understand the One and Only Lord. ||6||
Eating sweet treats, the mortal is filled with disease; he finds no peace at all.
Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, they walk on other paths, and at the very last moment, they regret and repent. ||7||
Wandering around at sacred shrines of pilgrimage, the mortal is not cured of his disease. Reading scripture, he gets involved in useless arguments.
The disease of duality is so very deadly; it causes dependence on Maya. ||8||
One who becomes Gurmukh and praises the True Shabad with the True Lord in his mind is cured of his disease.
O Nanak, the humble servant of the Lord is immaculate, night and day; he bears the insignia of the Lord's Grace. ||9||1||
