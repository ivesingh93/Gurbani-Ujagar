Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:
Fruitful is the life, the life of one who hears about the Lord, and chants and meditates on Him; he lives forever. ||1||Pause||
The real drink is that which satisfies the mind; this drink is the sublime essence of the Ambrosial Naam. ||1||
The real food is that which will never leave you hungry again; it will leave you contented and satisfied forever. ||2||
The real clothes are those which protect your honor before the Transcendent Lord, and do not leave you naked ever again. ||3||
The real enjoyment within the mind is to be absorbed in the sublime essence of the Lord, in the Society of the Saints. ||4||
Sew devotional worship to the Lord into the mind, without any needle or thread. ||5||
Imbued and intoxicated with the sublime essence of the Lord, this experience will never wear off again. ||6||
One is blessed with all treasures, when God, in His Mercy, gives them. ||7||
O Nanak, service to the Saints beings peace; I drink in the wash water of the feet of the Saints. ||8||3||6||
Maaroo, Fifth Mehl, Eighth House, Anjulees ~ With Hands Cupped In Prayer:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The household which is filled with abundance - that household suffers anxiety.
One whose household has little, wanders around searching for more.
He alone is happy and at peace, who is liberated from both conditions. ||1||
Householders and kings fall into hell, along with renunciates and angry men,
and all those who study and recite the Vedas in so many ways.
Perfect is the work of that humble servant, who remains unattached while in the body. ||2||
The mortal sleeps, even while he is awake; he is being plundered by doubt.
Without the Guru, liberation is not obtained, friend.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the bonds of egotism are released, and one comes to behold the One and only Lord. ||3||
Doing deeds, one is placed in bondage; but if he does not act, he is slandered.
Intoxicated with emotional attachment, the mind is afflicted with anxiety.
One who looks alike upon pleasure and pain, by Guru's Grace, sees the Lord in each and every heart. ||4||
Within the world, one is afflicted by skepticism;
he does not know the imperceptible Unspoken Speech of the Lord.
He alone understands, whom the Lord inspires to understand. The Lord cherishes him as His child. ||5||
He may try to abandon Maya, but he is not released.
If he collects things, then his mind is afraid of losing them.
I wave the fly-brush over that holy person, whose honor is protected in the midst of Maya. ||6||
He alone is a warrior hero, who remains dead to the world.
One who runs away will wander in reincarnation.
Whatever happens, accept that as good. Realize the Hukam of His Command, and your evil-mindedness will be burnt away. ||7||
Whatever He links us to, to that we are linked.
He acts, and does, and watches over His Creation.
You are the Giver of peace, the Perfect Lord of Nanak; as You grant Your blessings, I dwell upon Your Name. ||8||1||7||
Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:
Beneath the tree, all beings have gathered.
Some are hot-headed, and some speak very sweetly.
Sunset has come, and they rise up and depart; their days have run their course and expired. ||1||
Those who committed sins are sure to be ruined.
Azraa-eel, the Angel of Death, seizes and tortures them.
