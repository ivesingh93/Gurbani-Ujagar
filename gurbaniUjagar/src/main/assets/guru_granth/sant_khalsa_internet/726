Those Sikhs of the Guru, who serve the Guru, are the most blessed beings.
Servant Nanak is a sacrifice to them; He is forever and ever a sacrifice. ||10||
The Lord Himself is pleased with the Gurmukhs, the fellowship of the companions.
In the Lord's Court, they are given robes of honor, and the Lord Himself hugs them close in His embrace. ||11||
Please bless me with the Blessed Vision of the Darshan of those Gurmukhs, who meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
I wash their feet, and drink in the dust of their feet, dissolved in the wash water. ||12||
Those who eat betel nuts and betel leaf and smoke crude cigarette,
but do not contemplate the Lord, Har, Har - the Messenger of Death will seize them and take them away. ||13||
Ones who contemplate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and keep Him enshrined in their hearts,
the Messenger of Death does not even approach them; O, the Guru's Sikhs are the Guru's Beloveds! ||14||
The Name of the Lord is a treasure, known only to the few Gurmukhs.
O Nanak, those who meet with the True Guru, enjoy peace and pleasure. ||15||
The True Guru is called the Giver; in His Mercy, He grants His Grace.
I am forever a sacrifice to the Guru, who has blessed me with the Lord's Name. ||16||
Blessed, very blessed is the Guru, who brings the Lord's message.
I gaze upon the Guru, the Guru, the True Guru embodied, and I blossom forth in bliss. ||17||
The Guru's tongue recites Words of Ambrosial Nectar; He is adorned with the Lord's Name.
Those Sikhs who hear and obey the Guru - all their desires depart. ||18||
Some speak of the Lord's Path; tell me, how can I walk on it?
O Lord, Har, Har, Your Name is my supplies; I will take it with me and set out. ||19||
Those Gurmukhs who worship and adore the Lord, are wealthy and very wise.
I am forever a sacrifice to the True Guru; I am absorbed in the Words of the Guru's Teachings. ||20||
You are the Master, my Lord and Master; You are my RÃ¼ler and King.
If it is pleasing to Your Will, then I worship and serve You; You are the treasure of virtue. ||21||
The Lord Himself is absolute; He is The One and Only; but He Himself is also manifested in many forms.
Whatever pleases Him, O Nanak, that alone is good. ||22||2||
Tilang, Ninth Mehl, Kaafee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
If you are conscious, then be conscious of Him night and day, O mortal.
Each and every moment, your life is passing away, like water from a cracked pitcher. ||1||Pause||
Why do you not sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, you ignorant fool?
You are attached to false greed, and you do not even consider death. ||1||
Even now, no harm has been done, if you will only sing God's Praises.
Says Nanak, by meditating and vibrating upon Him, you shall obtain the state of fearlessness. ||2||1||
Tilang, Ninth Mehl:
Wake up, O mind! Wake up! Why are you sleeping unaware?
That body, which you were born with, shall not go along with you in the end. ||1||Pause||
Mother, father, children and relatives whom you love,
will throw your body into the fire, when your soul departs from it. ||1||
