All the Gurmukh's affairs are brought to perfect completion; the Lord has showered him with His Mercy.
O Nanak, one who meets the Primal Lord remains blended with the Lord, the Creator Lord. ||2||
Pauree:
You are True, O True Lord and Master. You are the Truest of the True, O Lord of the World.
Everyone meditates on You; everyone falls at Your Feet.
Your Praises are graceful and beautiful; You save those who speak them.
You reward the Gurmukhs, who are absorbed in the True Name.
O my Great Lord and Master, great is Your glorious greatness. ||1||
Shalok, Fourth Mehl:
Without the Name, all other praise and speech is insipid and tasteless.
The self-willed manmukhs praise their own egos; their attachment to egotism is useless.
Those whom they praise, die; they all waste away in conflict.
O servant Nanak, the Gurmukhs are saved, chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, the Embodiment of Supreme Bliss. ||1||
Fourth Mehl:
O True Guru, tell me of my Lord God, that I may meditate on the Naam within my mind.
O Nanak, the Lord's Name is sacred and pure; chanting it, all my pain has been taken away. ||2||
Pauree:
You Yourself are the Formless Lord, the Immaculate Lord, our Sovereign King.
Those who meditate on You, O True Lord with one-pointed mind, are rid of all their pain.
You have no equal, next to whom I might sit and speak of You.
You are the only Giver as great as Yourself. You are Immaculate; O True Lord, you are pleasing to my mind.
O my True Lord and Master, Your Name is the Truest of the True. ||2||
Shalok, Fourth Mehl:
Deep within the mind is the disease of ego; the self-willed manmukhs, the evil beings, are deluded by doubt.
O Nanak, this disease is eradicated, only when one meets the True Guru, our Holy Friend. ||1||
Fourth Mehl:
The mind and body of the Gurmukh are imbued with the Love of the Lord, the Treasure of Virtue.
Servant Nanak has taken to the Sanctuary of the Lord. Hail to the Guru, who has united me with the Lord. ||2||
Pauree:
You are the Personification of Creativity, the Inaccessible Lord. With whom should I compare You?
If there was anyone else as great as You, I would name him; You alone are like Yourself.
You are the One, permeating each and every heart; You are revealed to the Gurmukh.
You are the True Lord and Master of all; You are the Highest of all.
Whatever You do, O True Lord - that is what happens, so why should we grieve? ||3||
Shalok, Fourth Mehl:
My mind and body are imbued with the Love of my Beloved, twenty-four hours a day.
Shower Your Mercy upon servant Nanak, O God, that he may dwell in peace with the True Guru. ||1||
Fourth Mehl:
Those whose inner beings are filled with the Love of their Beloved, look beautiful as they speak.
O Nanak, the Lord Himself knows all; the Beloved Lord has infused His Love. ||2||
Pauree:
O Creator Lord, You Yourself are infallible; You never make mistakes.
Whatever You do is good, O True Lord; this understanding is obtained through the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
You are the Cause of causes, the All-powerful Lord; there is no other at all.
O Lord and Master, You are inaccessible and merciful. Everyone meditates on You.
