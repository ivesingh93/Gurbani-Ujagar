Bhairao, The Word Of Naam Dayv Jee, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O my tongue, I will cut you into a hundred pieces,
if you do not chant the Name of the Lord. ||1||
O my tongue, be imbued with the Lord's Name.
Meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and imbue yourself with this most excellent color. ||1||Pause||
O my tongue, other occupations are false.
The state of Nirvaanaa comes only through the Lord's Name. ||2||
The performance of countless millions of other devotions
is not equal to even one devotion to the Name of the Lord. ||3||
Prays Naam Dayv, this is my occupation.
O Lord, Your Forms are endless. ||4||1||
One who stays away from others' wealth and others' spouses-
the Lord abides near that person. ||1||
Those who do not meditate and vibrate on the Lord-
I do not even want to see them. ||1||Pause||
Those whose inner beings are not in harmony with the Lord,
are nothing more than beasts. ||2||
Prays Naam Dayv, a man without a nose
does not look handsome, even if he has the thirty-two beauty marks. ||3||2||
A cup of milk and a jug of water is brought to family god,
by Naam Dayv, after milking the brown cow. ||1||
Please drink this milk, O my Sovereign Lord God.
Drink this milk and my mind will be happy.
Otherwise, my father will be angry with me."||1||Pause||
Taking the golden cup, Naam Dayv filled it with the ambrosial milk,
and placed it before the Lord. ||2||
This one devotee abides within my heart,
the Lord looked upon Naam Dayv and smiled. ||3||
The Lord drank the milk, and the devotee returned home.
