Raag Saarang, Chau-Padas, First Mehl, First House:
One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:
I am the hand-maiden of my Lord and Master.
I have grasped the Feet of God, the Life of the world. He has killed and eradicated my egotism. ||1||Pause||
He is the Perfect, Supreme Light, the Supreme Lord God, my Beloved, my Breath of Life.
The Fascinating Lord has fascinated my mind; contemplating the Word of the Shabad, I have come to understand. ||1||
The worthless self-willed manmukh, with false and shallow understanding - his mind and body are held in pain's grip.
Since I came to be imbued with the Love of my Beautiful Lord, I meditate on the Lord, and my mind is encouraged. ||2||
Abandoning egotism, I have become detached. And now, I absorb true intuitive understanding.
The mind is pleased and appeased by the Pure, Immaculate Lord; the opinions of other people are irrelevant. ||3||
There is no other like You, in the past or in the future, O my Beloved, my Breath of Life, my Support.
The soul-bride is imbued with the Name of the Lord; O Nanak, the Lord is her Husband. ||4||1||
Saarang, First Mehl:
How can I survive without the Lord? I am suffering in pain.
My tongue does not taste - all is bland without the Lord's sublime essence. Without God, I suffer and die. ||1||Pause||
As long as I do not attain the Blessed Vision of my Beloved, I remain hungry and thirsty.
Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, my mind is pleased and appeased. The lotus blossoms forth in the water. ||1||
The low-hanging clouds crack with thunder and burst. The cuckoos and the peacocks are filled with passion,
along with the birds in the trees, the bulls and the snakes. The soul-bride is happy when her Husband Lord returns home. ||2||
She is filthy and ugly, unfeminine and ill-mannered - she has no intuitive understanding of her Husband Lord.
She is not satisfied by the sublime essence of her Lord's Love; she is evil-minded, immersed in her pain. ||3||
The soul-bride does not come and go in reincarnation or suffer in pain; her body is not touched by the pain of disease.
O Nanak, she is intuitively embellished by God; seeing God, her mind is encouraged. ||4||2||
Saarang, First Mehl:
My Beloved Lord God is not far away.
My mind is pleased and appeased by the Word of the True Guru's Teachings. I have found the Lord, the Support of my breath of life. ||1||Pause||
