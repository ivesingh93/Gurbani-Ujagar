Saarang, Fifth Mehl, Chau-Padas, Fifth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Meditate, vibrate on the Lord; other actions are corrupt.
Pride, attachment and desire are not quenched; the world is in the grip of death. ||1||Pause||
Eating, drinking, laughing and sleeping, life passes uselessly.
The mortal wanders in reincarnation, burning in the hellish environment of the womb; in the end, he is destroyed by death. ||1||
He practices fraud, cruelty and slander against others; he sins, and washes his hands.
Without the True Guru, he has no understanding; he is lost in the utter darkness of anger and attachment. ||2||
He takes the intoxicating drugs of cruelty and corruption, and is plundered. He is not conscious of the Creator Lord God.
The Lord of the Universe is hidden and unattached. The mortal is like a wild elephant, intoxicated with the wine of egotism. ||3||
In His Mercy, God saves His Saints; they have the Support of His Lotus Feet.
With his palms pressed together, Nanak has come to the Sanctuary of the Primal Being, the Infinite Lord God. ||4||1||129||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl, Sixth House, Partaal:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Chant His Sublime Word and His Priceless Glories.
Why are you indulging in corrupt actions?
Look at this, see and understand!
Meditate on the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and attain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.
Imbued with the Love of the Lord, you shall totally play with Him. ||1||Pause||
The world is a dream.
Its expanse is false.
O my companion, why are you so enticed by the Enticer? Enshrine the Love of Your Beloved within your heart. ||1||
He is total love and affection.
God is always merciful.
Others - why are you involved with others?
Remain involved with the Lord.
When you join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy,
says Nanak, meditate on the Lord.
Now, your association with death is ended. ||2||1||130||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
You may make donations of gold,
and give away land in charity
and purify your mind in various ways,
but none of this is equal to the Lord's Name. Remain attached to the Lord's Lotus Feet. ||1||Pause||
You may recite the four Vedas with your tongue,
and listen to the eighteen Puraanas and the six Shaastras with your ears,
but these are not equal to the celestial melody of the Naam, the Name of the Lord of the Universe.
Remain attached to the Lord's Lotus Feet. ||1||
You may observe fasts, and say your prayers, purify yourself
and do good deeds; you may go on pilgrimages everywhere and eat nothing at all.
You may cook your food without touching anyone;
you may make a great show of cleansing techniques,
and burn incense and devotional lamps, but none of these are equal to the Lord's Name.
O Merciful Lord, please hear the prayer of the meek and the poor.
Please grant me the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, that I may see You with my eyes. The Naam is so sweet to servant Nanak. ||2||2||131||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Meditate on the Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam. The Lord is your Help and Support. ||1||Pause||
