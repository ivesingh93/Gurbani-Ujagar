The mind is engrossed in sexual desire, anger, greed and emotional attachment.
Breaking my bonds, the Guru has liberated me. ||2||
Experiencing pain and pleasure, one is born, only to die again.
The Lotus Feet of the Guru bring peace and shelter. ||3||
The world is drowning in the ocean of fire.
O Nanak, holding me by the arm, the True Guru has saved me. ||4||3||8||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Body, mind, wealth and everything, I surrender to my Lord.
What is that wisdom, by which I may come to chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har? ||1||
Nurturing hope, I have come to beg from God.
Gazing upon You, the courtyard of my heart is embellished. ||1||Pause||
Trying several methods, I reflect deeply upon the Lord.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, this mind is saved. ||2||
I have neither intelligence, wisdom, common sense nor cleverness.
I meet You, only if You lead me to meet You. ||3||
My eyes are content, gazing upon the Blessed Vision of God's Darshan.
Says Nanak, such a life is fruitful and rewarding. ||4||4||9||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Mother, father, children and the wealth of Maya, will not go along with you.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, all pain is dispelled. ||1||
God Himself is pervading, and permeating all.
Chant the Name of the Lord with your tongue, and pain will not afflict you. ||1||Pause||
One who is afflicted by the terrible fire of thirst and desire,
becomes cool, chanting the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har. ||2||
By millions of efforts, peace is not obtained;
the mind is satisfied only by singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||3||
Please bless me with devotion, O God, O Searcher of hearts.
This is Nanak's prayer, O Lord and Master. ||4||5||10||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
By great good fortune, the Perfect Guru is found.
Meeting with the Holy Saints, meditate on the Name of the Lord. ||1||
O Supreme Lord God, I seek Your Sanctuary.
Meditating on the Guru's Feet, sinful mistakes are erased. ||1||Pause||
All other rituals are just worldly affairs;
joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, one is saved. ||2||
One may contemplate the Simritees, Shaastras and Vedas,
but only by chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is one saved and carried across. ||3||
Have Mercy upon servant Nanak, O God,
and bless him with the dust of the feet of the Holy, that he may be emancipated. ||4||6||11||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
I contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad within my heart;
all my hopes and desires are fulfilled. ||1||
The faces of the humble Saints are radiant and bright;
the Lord has mercifully blessed them with the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Holding them by the hand, He has lifted them up out of the deep, dark pit,
and their victory is celebrated throughout the world. ||2||
He elevates and exalts the lowly, and fills the empty.
They receive the supreme, sublime essence of the Ambrosial Naam. ||3||
The mind and body are made immaculate and pure, and sins are burnt to ashes.
Says Nanak, God is pleased with me. ||4||7||12||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
All desires are fulfilled, O my friend,
