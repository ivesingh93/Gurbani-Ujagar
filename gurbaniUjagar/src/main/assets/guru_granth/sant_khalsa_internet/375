My mind's desire for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan is so great. Is there any Saint who can lead me to meet my Beloved? ||1||Pause||
The four watches of the day are like the four ages.
And when night comes, I think that it shall never end. ||2||
The five demons have joined together, to separate me from my Husband Lord.
Wandering and rambling, I cry out and wring my hands. ||3||
The Lord has revealed the Blessed Vision of His Darshan to servant Nanak;
realizing his own self, he has obtained supreme peace. ||4||15||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
In the Lord's service, are the greatest treasures.
Serving the Lord, the Ambrosial Naam comes into one's mouth. ||1||
The Lord is my Companion; He is with me, as my Help and Support.
In pain and pleasure, whenever I remember Him, He is present. How can the poor Messenger of Death frighten me now? ||1||Pause||
The Lord is my Support; the Lord is my Power.
The Lord is my Friend; He is my mind's advisor. ||2||
The Lord is my capital; the Lord is my credit.
As Gurmukh, I earn the wealth, with the Lord as my Banker. ||3||
By Guru's Grace, this wisdom has come.
Servant Nanak has merged into the Being of the Lord. ||4||16||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
When God shows His Mercy, then this mind is focused on Him.
Serving the True Guru, all rewards are obtained. ||1||
O my mind, why are you so sad? My True Guru is Perfect.
He is the Giver of blessings, the treasure of all comforts; His Ambrosial Pool of Nectar is always overflowing. ||1||Pause||
One who enshrines His Lotus Feet within the heart,
meets the Beloved Lord; the Divine Light is revealed to him. ||2||
The five companions have met together to sing the songs of joy.
The unstruck melody, the sound current of the Naad, vibrates and resounds. ||3||
O Nanak, when the Guru is totally pleased, one meets the Lord, the King.
Then, the night of one's life passes in peace and natural ease. ||4||17||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Showing His Mercy, the Lord has revealed Himself to me.
Meeting the True Guru, I have received the perfect wealth. ||1||
Gather such a wealth of the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny.
It cannot be burned by fire, and water cannot drown it; it does not forsake society, or go anywhere else. ||1||Pause||
It does not run short, and it does not run out.
Eating and consuming it, the mind remains satisfied. ||2||
He is the true banker, who gathers the wealth of the Lord within his own home.
With this wealth, the whole world profits. ||3||
He alone receives the Lord's wealth, who is pre-ordained to receive it.
O servant Nanak, at that very last moment, the Naam shall be your only decoration. ||4||18||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Just like the farmer, He plants His crop,
and, whether it is ripe or unripe, He cuts it down. ||1||
Just so, you must know this well, that whoever is born, shall die.
Only the devotee of the Lord of the Universe becomes stable and permanent. ||1||Pause||
The day shall certainly be followed by the night.
And when the night passes, the morning shall again dawn. ||2||
In the love of Maya, the unfortunate ones remain in sleep.
By Guru's Grace, a rare few remain awake and aware. ||3||
