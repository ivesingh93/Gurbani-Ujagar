Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl, Chhant:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The True Guru is merciful to the meek; in His Presence, the Lord's Praises are sung.
The Ambrosial Name of the Lord is chanted in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
Vibrating, and worshipping the One Lord in the Company of the Holy, the pains of birth and death are removed.
Those who have such karma pre-ordained, study and learn the Truth; the noose of Death is removed from their necks.
Their fears and doubts are dispelled, the knot of death is untied, and they never have to walk on Death's path.
Prays Nanak, shower me with Your Mercy, Lord; let me sing Your Glorious Praises forever. ||1||
The Name of the One, Immaculate Lord is the Support of the unsupported.
You are the Giver, the Great Giver, the Dispeller of all sorrow.
O Destroyer of pain, Creator Lord, Master of peace and bliss, I have come seeking the Sanctuary of the Holy;
please, help me to cross over the terrifying and difficult world-ocean in an instant.
I saw the Lord pervading and permeating everywhere, when the healing ointment of the Guru's wisdom was applied to my eyes.
Prays Nanak, remember Him forever in meditation, the Destroyer of all sorrow and fear. ||2||
He Himself has attached me to the hem of His robe; He has showered me with His Mercy.
I am worthless, lowly and helpless; God is unfathomable and infinite.
My Lord and Master is always merciful, kind and compassionate; He uplifts and establishes the lowly.
All beings and creatures are under Your power; You take care of all.
He Himself is the Creator, and He Himself is the Enjoyer; He Himself is the Contemplator of all.
Prays Nanak, singing Your Glorious Praises, I live, chanting the Chant of the Lord, the Lord of the world-forest. ||3||
The Blessed Vision of Your Darshan is incomparable; Your Name is utterly priceless.
O my Incomputable Lord, Your humble servants ever meditate on You.
You dwell on the tongues of the Saints, by Your own pleasure; they are intoxicated with Your sublime essence, O Lord.
Those who are attached to Your feet are very blessed; night and day, they remain always awake and aware.
Forever and ever, meditate in remembrance on the Lord and Master; with each and every breath, speak His Glorious Praises.
Prays Nanak, let me become the dust of the feet of the Saints. God's Name is invaluable. ||4||1||
Raag Dhanaasaree, The Word Of Devotee Kabeer Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Beings like Sanak, Sanand, Shiva,
and Shaysh-naaga - none of them know Your mystery, Lord. ||1||
In the Society of the Saints, the Lord dwells within the heart. ||1||Pause||
Beings like Hanumaan, Garura,
Indra the King of the gods and the rulers of humans - none of them know Your Glories, Lord. ||2||
The four Vedas, the Simritees and the Puraanas,
Vishnu the Lord of Lakshmi and Lakshmi herself - none of them know the Lord. ||3||
Says Kabeer, one does not wander around lost,
who falls at the Lord's feet and remains in His Sanctuary. ||4||1||
