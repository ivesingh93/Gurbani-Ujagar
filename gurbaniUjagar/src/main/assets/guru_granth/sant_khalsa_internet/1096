Pauree:
You have no form or shape, no social class or race.
These humans believe that You are far away; but You are quite obviously apparent.
You enjoy Yourself in every heart, and no filth sticks to You.
You are the blissful and infinite Primal Lord God; Your Light is all-pervading.
Among all divine beings, You are the most divine, O Creator-architect, Rejuvenator of all.
How can my single tongue worship and adore You? You are the eternal, imperishable, infinite Lord God.
One whom You Yourself unite with the True Guru - all his generations are saved.
All Your servants serve You; Nanak is a humble servant at Your Door. ||5||
Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:
He builds a hut of straw, and the fool lights a fire in it.
Only those who have such pre-ordained destiny on their foreheads, find Shelter with the Master. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
O Nanak, he grinds the corn, cooks it and places it before himself.
But without his True Guru, he sits and waits for his food to be blessed. ||2||
Fifth Mehl:
O Nanak, the loaves of bread are baked and placed on the plate.
Those who obey their Guru, eat and are totally satisfied. ||3||
Pauree:
You have staged this play in the world, and infused egotism into all beings.
In the one temple of the body are the five thieves, who continually misbehave.
The ten brides, the sensory organs were created, and the one husband, the self; the ten are engrossed in flavors and tastes.
This Maya fascinates and entices them; they wander continually in doubt.
You created both sides, spirit and matter, Shiva and Shakti.
Matter loses out to spirit; this is pleasing to the Lord.
You enshrined spirit within, which leads to merger with the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation.
Within the bubble, You formed the bubble, which shall once again merge into the water. ||6||
Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:
Look ahead; don't turn your face backwards.
O Nanak, be successful this time, and you shall not be reincarnated again. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
My joyful friend is called the friend of all.
All think of Him as their own; He never breaks anyone's heart. ||2||
Fifth Mehl:
The hidden jewel has been found; it has appeared on my forehead.
Beautiful and exalted is that place, O Nanak, where You dwell, O my Dear Lord. ||3||
Pauree:
When You are on my side, Lord, what do I need to worry about?
You entrusted everything to me, when I became Your slave.
My wealth is inexhaustible, no matter how much I spend and consume.
The 8.4 million species of beings all work to serve me.
All these enemies have become my friends, and no one wishes me ill.
No one calls me to account, since God is my forgiver.
I have become blissful, and I have found peace, meeting with the Guru, the Lord of the Universe.
All my affairs have been resolved, since You are pleased with me. ||7||
Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:
I am so eager to see You, O Lord; what does Your face look like?
I wandered around in such a miserable state, but when I saw You, my mind was comforted and consoled. ||1||
