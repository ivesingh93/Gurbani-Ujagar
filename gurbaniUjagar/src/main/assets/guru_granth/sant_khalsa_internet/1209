Saarang, Fifth Mehl, Du-Padas, Fourth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O my Fascinating Lord, I pray to You: come into my house.
I act in pride, and speak in pride. I am mistaken and wrong, but I am still Your hand-maiden, O my Beloved. ||1||Pause||
I hear that You are near, but I cannot see You. I wander in suffering, deluded by doubt.
The Guru has become merciful to me; He has removed the veils. Meeting with my Beloved, my mind blossoms forth in abundance. ||1||
If I were to forget my Lord and Master, even for an instant, it would be like millions of days, tens of thousands of years.
When I joined the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O Nanak, I met my Lord. ||2||1||24||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Now what should I think? I have given up thinking.
You do whatever You wish to do. Please bless me with Your Name - I am a sacrifice to You. ||1||Pause||
The poison of corruption is flowering forth in the four directions; I have taken the GurMantra as my antidote.
Giving me His Hand, He has saved me as His Own; like the lotus in the water, I remain unattached. ||1||
I am nothing. What am I? You hold all in Your Power.
Nanak has run to Your Sanctuary, Lord; please save him, for the sake of Your Saints. ||2||2||25||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Now I have abandoned all efforts and devices.
My Lord and Master is the All-powerful Creator, the Cause of causes, my only Saving Grace. ||1||Pause||
I have seen numerous forms of incomparable beauty, but nothing is like You.
You give Your Support to all, O my Lord and Master; You are the Giver of peace, of the soul and the breath of life. ||1||
Wandering, wandering, I grew so tired; meeting the Guru, I fell at His Feet.
Says Nanak, I have found total peace; this life-night of mine passes in peace. ||2||3||26||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Now I have found the Support of my Lord.
The Guru, the Giver of peace, has become merciful to me. I was blind - I see the jewel of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
I have cut away the darkness of ignorance and become immaculate; my discriminating intellect has blossomed forth.
As the waves of water and the foam become water again, the Lord and His servant become One. ||1||
He is taken in again, into what from which he came; all is one in the One Lord.
O Nanak, I have come to see the Master of the breath of life, all-pervading everywhere. ||2||4||27||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
My mind longs for the One Beloved Lord.
I have looked everywhere in every country, but nothing equals even a hair of my Beloved. ||1||Pause||
All sorts of delicacies and dainties are placed before me, but I do not even want to look at them.
I long for the sublime essence of the Lord, calling, "Pri-o! Pri-o! - Beloved! Beloved!", like the Bumble bee longing for the lotus flower. ||1||
