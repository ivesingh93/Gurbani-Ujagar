The Name makes a man pure and fearless.
It makes the masterless become the master of all. I am a sacrifice to him.
Such a person is not reincarnated again; he sings the Glories of God. ||5||
Inwardly and outwardly, he knows the One Lord;
through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he realizes himself.
He bears the Banner and Insignia of the True Shabad in the Lord's Court. ||6||
One who dies in the Shabad abides in his own home within.
He does not come or go in reincarnation, and his hopes are subdued.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, his heart-lotus blossoms forth. ||7||
Whoever is seen, is driven by hope and despair,
by sexual desire, anger, corruption, hunger and thirst.
O Nanak, those detached recluses who meet the Lord are so very rare. ||8||7||
Gauree, First Mehl:
Meeting such a slave, peace is obtained.
Pain is forgotten, when the True Lord is found. ||1||
Beholding the blessed vision of his darshan, my understanding has become perfect.
The cleansing baths at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage are in the dust of his feet. ||1||Pause||
My eyes are contented with the constant love of the One Lord.
My tongue is purified by the most sublime essence of the Lord. ||2||
True are my actions, and deep within my being, I serve Him.
My mind is satisfied by the Inscrutable, Mysterious Lord. ||3||
Wherever I look, there I find the True Lord.
Without understanding, the world argues in falsehood. ||4||
When the Guru instructs, understanding is obtained.
How rare is that Gurmukh who understands. ||5||
Show Your Mercy, and save me, O Savior Lord!
Without understanding, people become beasts and demons. ||6||
The Guru has said that there is no other at all.
So tell me, who should I see, and who should I worship? ||7||
For the sake of the Saints, God has established the three worlds.
One who understands his own soul, contemplates the essence of reality. ||8||
One whose heart is filled with Truth and true love -
prays Nanak, I am his servant. ||9||8||
Gauree, First Mehl:
Brahma acted in pride, and did not understand.
Only when he was faced with the downfall of the Vedas did he repent.
Remembering God in meditation, the mind is conciliated. ||1||
Such is the horrible pride of the world.
The Guru eliminates the pride of those who meet Him. ||1||Pause||
Bal the King, in Maya and egotism,
held his ceremonial feasts, but he was puffed up with pride.
Without the Guru's advice, he had to go to the underworld. ||2||
Hari Chand gave in charity, and earned public praise.
But without the Guru, he did not find the limits of the Mysterious Lord.
The Lord Himself misleads people, and He Himself imparts understanding. ||3||
The evil-minded Harnaakhash committed evil deeds.
God, the Lord of all, is the Destroyer of pride.
He bestowed His Mercy, and saved Prahlaad. ||4||
Raawan was deluded, foolish and unwise.
Sri Lanka was plundered, and he lost his head.
He indulged in ego, and lacked the love of the True Guru. ||5||
The Lord killed the thousand-armed Arjun, and the demons Madhu-keetab and Meh-khaasaa.
He seized Harnaakhash and tore him apart with his nails.
The demons were slain; they did not practice devotional worship. ||6||
The demons Jaraa-sandh and Kaal-jamun were destroyed.
Rakat-beej and Kaal-naym were annihilated.
Slaying the demons, the Lord saved His Saints. ||7||
He Himself, as the True Guru, contemplates the Shabad.
