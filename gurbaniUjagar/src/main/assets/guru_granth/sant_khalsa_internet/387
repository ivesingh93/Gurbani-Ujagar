I sing the Praises of the Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam.
By the graceful favor of the Saints, I meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||1||Pause||
Everything is strung on His string.
He is contained in each and every heart. ||2||
He creates and destroys in an instant.
He Himself remains unattached, and without attributes. ||3||
He is the Creator, the Cause of causes, the Searcher of hearts.
Nanak's Lord and Master celebrates in bliss. ||4||13||64||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
My wandering through millions of births has ended.
I have won, and not lost, this human body, so difficult to obtain. ||1||
My sins have been erased, and my sufferings and pains are gone.
I have been sanctified by the dust of the feet of the Saints. ||1||Pause||
The Saints of God have the ability to save us;
they meet with those of us who have such pre-ordained destiny. ||2||
My mind is filled with bliss, since the Guru gave me the Mantra of the Lord's Name.
My thirst has been quenched, and my mind has become steady and stable. ||3||
The wealth of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is for me the nine treasures, and the spiritual powers of the Siddhas.
O Nanak, I have obtained understanding from the Guru. ||4||14||65||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
My thirst, and the darkness of ignorance have been removed.
Serving the Holy Saints, countless sins are obliterated. ||1||
I have obtained celestial peace and immense joy.
Serving the Guru, my mind has become immaculately pure, and I have heard the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har. ||1||Pause||
The stubborn foolishness of my mind is gone;
God's Will has become sweet to me. ||2||
I have grasped the Feet of the Perfect Guru,
and the sins of countless incarnations have been washed away. ||3||
The jewel of this life has become fruitful.
Says Nanak, God has shown mercy to me. ||4||15||66||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
I contemplate, forever and ever, the True Guru;
with my hair, I dust the feet of the Guru. ||1||
Be wakeful, O my awakening mind!
Without the Lord, nothing else shall be of use to you; false is emotional attachment, and useless are worldly entanglements. ||1||Pause||
Embrace love for the Word of the Guru's Bani.
When the Guru shows His Mercy, pain is destroyed. ||2||
Without the Guru, there is no other place of rest.
The Guru is the Giver, the Guru gives the Name. ||3||
The Guru is the Supreme Lord God; He Himself is the Transcendent Lord.
Twenty-four hours a day, O Nanak, meditate on the Guru. ||4||16||67||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
He Himself is the tree, and the branches extending out.
He Himself preserves His own crop. ||1||
Wherever I look, I see that One Lord alone.
Deep within each and every heart, He Himself is contained. ||1||Pause||
He Himself is the sun, and the rays emanating from it.
He is concealed, and He is revealed. ||2||
He is said to be of the highest attributes, and without attributes.
Both converge onto His single point. ||3||
Says Nanak, the Guru has dispelled my doubt and fear.
With my eyes, I perceive the Lord, the embodiment of bliss, to be everywhere. ||4||17||68||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
I know nothing of arguments or cleverness.
