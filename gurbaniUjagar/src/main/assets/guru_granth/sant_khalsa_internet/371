As long as she lived with her father,
her Husband wandered around in sadness.
I served and surrendered to the Lord, the True Being;
the Guru brought my bride to my home, and I obtained total happiness. ||2||
She is blessed with all sublime attributes, and her generations are unblemished.
She she is obedient, sagacious and beauteous.
Her Husband, her Lord and Master, fulfills her heart's desires.
Hope and desire (my younger brother-in-law and sister-in-law) are now totally content. ||3||
She is the most noble of all the family.
She counsels and advises her hope and desire.
How blessed is that household, in which she has appeared.
O servant Nanak, she passes her time in perfect peace and comfort. ||4||3||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Whatever I resolve, she does not allow it to come to pass.
She stands blocking the way of goodness and self-discipline.
She wears many disguises, and assumes many forms,
and she does not allow me to dwell in my own home. She forces me to wander around in different directions. ||1||
She has become the mistress of my home, and she does not allow me to live in it.
If I try, she fights with me. ||1||Pause||
In the beginning, she was sent as a helper,
but she has overwhelmed the nine continents, all places and interspaces.
She has not spared even the river banks, the sacred shrines of pilgrimage, the Yogis and Sannyaasees,
or those who tirelessly read the Simritees and study the Vedas. ||2||
Wherever I sit, she sits there with me.
She has imposed her power upon the whole world.
Seeking meager protection, I am not protected from her.
Tell me, O my friend: unto whom should I turn for protection? ||3||
I heard of His Teachings, and so I have come to the True Guru.
The Guru has implanted the Mantra of the Lord's Name, Har, Har, within me.
And now, I dwell in the home of my own inner self; I sing the Glorious Praises of the Infinite Lord.
I have met God, O Nanak, and I have become care-free. ||4||
My home is now my own, and she is now my mistress.
She is now my servant, and the Guru has made me intimate with the Lord. ||1||Second. Pause||4||4||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
First, they advised me to send a letter.
Second, they advised me to send two men.
Third, they advised me to make the effort and do something.
But I have renounced everything, and I meditate only on You, God. ||1||
Now, I am totally blissful, carefree and at ease.
The enemies and evil-doers have perished, and I have obtained peace. ||1||Pause||
The True Guru has imparted the Teachings to me.
My soul, body and everything belong to the Lord.
Whatever I do, is by Your Almighty Power.
You are my only Support, You are my only Court. ||2||
If I were to renounce You, God, unto whom could I turn?
There is no other, comparable to You.
Who else is Your servant to serve?
The faithless cynics are deluded; they wander around in the wilderness. ||3||
Your Glorious Greatness cannot be described.
Wherever I am, you save me, hugging me close in Your embrace.
Nanak, Your slave, has entered Your Sanctuary.
God has preserved his honor, and congratulations are pouring in. ||4||5||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
