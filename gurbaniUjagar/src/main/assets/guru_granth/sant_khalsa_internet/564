You Yourself are the Cause of causes, You Yourself are the Creator.
By Your Will, we are born, and by Your Will, we die. ||2||
Your Name is the Support of our mind and body.
This is Your blessing to Nanak, Your slave. ||3||8||
Wadahans, Fifth Mehl, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Deep within me, there is a longing to meet my Beloved; how can I attain my Perfect Guru?
Even though a baby may play hundreds of games, he cannot survive without milk.
The hunger within me is not satisfied, O my friend, even though I am served hundreds of dishes.
My mind and body are filled with love for my Beloved; how can my soul find relief, without the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan? ||1||
Listen, O my dear friends and siblings - lead me to my True Friend, the Giver of peace.
He knows all the troubles of my soul; every day, he tells me stories of the Lord.
I cannot live without Him, even for an instant. I cry out for Him, just as the song-bird cries for the drop of water.
Which of Your Glorious Virtues should I sing? You save even worthless beings like me. ||2||
I have become depressed, waiting for my Husband Lord, O my friend; when shall my eyes behold my Husband?
I have forgotten how to enjoy all pleasures; without my Husband Lord, they are of no use at all.
These clothes do not please my body; I cannot dress myself.
I bow to those friends of mine, who have enjoyed their Beloved Husband Lord. ||3||
I have adorned myself with all sorts of decorations, O my friend, but without my Husband Lord, they are of no use at all.
When my Husband does not care for me, O my friend, then my youth passes, totally useless.
Blessed, blessed are the happy soul-brides, O my friend, who are blended with their Husband Lord.
I am a sacrifice to those happy soul-brides; I wash their feet again and again. ||4||
As long as I suffered from duality and doubt, O my friend, I thought God was far away.
But when I met the Perfect True Guru, O my friend, then all my hopes and desires were fulfilled.
I have obtained all pleasures and comforts, O my friend; my Husband Lord is all-pervading everywhere.
Servant Nanak enjoys the Lord's Love, O my friend; I fall at the feet of the Guru, the True Guru. ||5||1||9||
Wadahans, Third Mehl, Ashtapadees:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
True is the Bani of His Word, and True is the melody; True is contemplative meditation on the Word of the Shabad.
Night and day, I praise the True Lord. Blessed, blessed is my great good fortune. ||1||
O my mind, let yourself be a sacrifice to the True Name.
If you become the slave of the Lord's slaves, you shall obtain the True Name. ||1||Pause||
