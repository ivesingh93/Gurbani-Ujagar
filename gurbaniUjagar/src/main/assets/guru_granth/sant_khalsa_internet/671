Lured by sexual desire, the elephant is trapped; the poor beast falls into the power of another.
Lured by the sound of the hunter's bell, the deer offers its head; because of this enticement, it is killed. ||2||
Gazing upon his family, the mortal is enticed by greed; he clings in attachment to Maya.
Totally engrossed in worldly things, he considers them to be his own; but in the end, he shall surely have to leave them behind. ||3||
Know it well, that anyone who loves any other than God, shall be miserable forever.
Says Nanak, the Guru has explained this to me, that love for God brings lasting bliss. ||4||2||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
Granting His Grace, God has blessed me with His Name, and released me of my bonds.
I have forgotten all worldly entanglements, and I am attached to the Guru's feet. ||1||
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I have renounced my other cares and anxieties.
I dug a deep pit, and buried my egotistical pride, emotional attachment and the desires of my mind. ||1||Pause||
No one is my enemy, and I am no one's enemy.
God, who expanded His expanse, is within all; I learned this from the True Guru. ||2||
I am a friend to all; I am everyone's friend.
When the sense of separation was removed from my mind, then I was united with the Lord, my King. ||3||
My stubbornness is gone, Ambrosial Nectar rains down, and the Word of the Guru's Shabad seems so sweet to me.
He is pervading everywhere, in the water, on the land and in the sky; Nanak beholds the all-pervading Lord. ||4||3||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
Ever since I obtained the Blessed Vision of the Darshan of the Holy, my days have been blessed and prosperous.
I have found lasting bliss, singing the Kirtan of the Praises of the Primal Lord, the Architect of destiny. ||1||
Now, I sing the Praises of the Lord within my mind.
My mind has been illumined and enlightened, and it is always at peace; I have found the Perfect True Guru. ||1||Pause||
The Lord, the treasure of virtue, abides deep within the heart, and so pain, doubt and fear have been dispelled.
I have obtained the most incomprehensible thing, enshrining love for the Name of the Lord. ||2||
I was anxious, and now I am free of anxiety; I was worried, and now I am free of worry; my grief, greed and emotional attachments are gone.
By His Grace, I am cured of the disease of egotism, and the Messenger of Death no longer terrifies me. ||3||
Working for the Guru, serving the Guru and the Guru's Command, all are pleasing to me.
Says Nanak, He has released me from the clutches of Death; I am a sacrifice to that Guru. ||4||4||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
Body, mind, wealth and everything belong to Him; He alone is all-wise and all-knowing.
He listens to my pains and pleasures, and then my condition improves. ||1||
My soul is satisfied with the One Lord alone.
People make all sorts of other efforts, but they have no value at all. ||Pause||
The Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, is a priceless jewel. The Guru has given me this advice.
It cannot be lost, and it cannot be shaken off; it remains steady, and I am perfectly satisfied with it. ||2||
Those things which tore me away from You, Lord, are now gone.
