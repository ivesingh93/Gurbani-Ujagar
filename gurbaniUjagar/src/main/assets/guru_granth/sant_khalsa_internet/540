Bihaagraa, Fourth Mehl:
Those who do not remember the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my soul - those self-willed manmukhs are foolish and ignorant.
Those who attach their consciousness to emotional attachment and Maya, O my soul, depart regretfully in the end.
They find no place of rest in the Court of the Lord, O my soul; those self-willed manmukhs are deluded by sin.
O servant Nanak, those who meet the Guru are saved, O my soul; chanting the Name of the Lord, they are absorbed in the Name of the Lord. ||1||
Go, everyone, and meet the True Guru; O my soul, He implants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, within the heart.
Do not hesitate for an instant - meditate on the Lord, O my soul; who knows whether he shall draw another breath?
That time, that moment, that instant, that second is so fruitful, O my soul, when my Lord comes into my mind.
Servant Nanak has meditated on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, O my soul, and now, the Messenger of Death does not draw near him. ||2||
The Lord continually watches, and hears everything, O my soul; he alone is afraid, who commits sins.
One whose heart is pure within, O my soul, casts off all his fears.
One who has faith in the Fearless Name of the Lord, O my soul - all his enemies and attackers speak against him in vain.
