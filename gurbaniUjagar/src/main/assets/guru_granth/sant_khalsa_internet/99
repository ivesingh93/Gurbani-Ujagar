When I dwell upon Him in my soul, all my sorrows depart.
The sickness of anxiety and the disease of ego are cured; He Himself cherishes me. ||2||
Like a child, I ask for everything.
God is Bountiful and Beautiful; He never comes up empty.
Again and again, I fall at His Feet. He is Merciful to the meek, the Sustainer of the World. ||3||
I am a sacrifice to the Perfect True Guru,
who has shattered all my bonds.
With the Naam, the Name of the Lord, in my heart, I have been purified. O Nanak, His Love has imbued me with nectar. ||4||8||15||
Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
O my Love, Sustainer of the World, Merciful, Loving Lord,
Profoundly Deep, Infinite Lord of the Universe,
Highest of the High, Unfathomable, Infinite Lord and Master: continually remembering You in deep meditation, I live. ||1||
O Destroyer of pain, Priceless Treasure,
Fearless, free of hate, Unfathomable, Immeasurable,
of Undying Form, Unborn, Self-illumined: remembering You in meditation, my mind is filled with a deep and profound peace. ||2||
The Joyous Lord, the Sustainer of the World, is my constant Companion.
He cherishes the high and the low.
The Nectar of the Name satisfies my mind. As Gurmukh, I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar. ||3||
In suffering and in comfort, I meditate on You, O Beloved.
I have obtained this sublime understanding from the Guru.
You are Nanak's Support, O my Lord and Master; through Your Love, I swim across to the other side. ||4||9||16||
Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
Blessed is that time when I meet the True Guru.
Gazing upon the Fruitful Vision of His Darshan, I have been saved.
Blessed are the hours, the minutes and the seconds-blessed is that Union with Him. ||1||
Making the effort, my mind has become pure.
Walking on the Lord's Path, my doubts have all been cast out.
The True Guru has inspired me to hear the Treasure of the Naam; all my illness has been dispelled. ||2||
The Word of Your Bani is inside and outside as well.
You Yourself chant it, and You Yourself speak it.
The Guru has said that He is One-All is the One. There shall never be any other. ||3||
I drink in the Lord's Ambrosial Essence from the Guru;
the Lord's Name has become my clothing and food.
The Name is my delight, the Name is my play and entertainment. O Nanak, I have made the Name my enjoyment. ||4||10||17||
Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
I beg of all the Saints: please, give me the merchandise.
I offer my prayers-I have forsaken my pride.
I am a sacrifice, hundreds of thousands of times a sacrifice, and I pray: please, give me the dust of the feet of the Saints. ||1||
You are the Giver, You are the Architect of Destiny.
You are All-powerful, the Giver of Eternal Peace.
You bless everyone. Please bring my life to fulfillment. ||2||
The body-temple is sanctified by the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan,
and thus, the impregnable fort of the soul is conquered.
You are the Giver, You are the Architect of Destiny. There is no other warrior as great as You. ||3||
