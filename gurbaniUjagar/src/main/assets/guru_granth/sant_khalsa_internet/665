True is service to the True Lord God.
O Nanak, the Naam is the Embellisher. ||4||4||
Dhanaasaree, Third Mehl:
I am a sacrifice to those who serve the Lord.
The Truth is in their hearts, and the True Name is on their lips.
Dwelling upon the Truest of the True, their pains are dispelled.
Through the True Word of the Shabad, the Lord comes to dwell in their minds. ||1||
Listening to the Word of Gurbani, filth is washed off,
and they naturally enshrine the Lord's Name in their minds. ||1||Pause||
One who conquers fraud, deceit and the fire of desire
finds tranquility, peace and pleasure within.
If one walks in harmony with the Guru's Will, he eliminates his self-conceit.
He finds the True Mansion of the Lord's Presence, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||2||
The blind, self-willed manmukh does not understand the Shabad; he does not know the Word of the Guru's Bani,
and so he passes his life in misery.
But if he meets the True Guru, then he finds peace,
and the ego within is silenced. ||3||
Who else should I speak to? The One Lord is the Giver of all.
When He grants His Grace, then we obtain the Word of the Shabad.
Meeting with my Beloved, I sing the Glorious Praises of the True Lord.
O Nanak, becoming truthful, I have become pleasing to the True Lord. ||4||5||
Dhanaasaree, Third Mehl:
When the mind is conquered, its turbulent wanderings are stopped.
Without conquering the mind, how can the Lord be found?
Rare is the one who knows the medicine to conquer the mind.
The mind is conquered through the Word of the Shabad; this is known to the Lord's humble servant. ||1||
The Lord forgives him, and blesses him with glory.
By Guru's Grace, the Lord comes to dwell in the mind. ||Pause||
The Gurmukh does good deeds,
and so, he comes to understand this mind.
The mind is intoxicated, like the elephant with wine.
The Guru places the harness upon it, and rejuvenates it. ||2||
The mind is undisciplined; only a rare few can discipline it.
If some one controls the difficult mind, then he becomes immaculate.
As Gurmukh, his mind is embellished.
Egotism and corruption are eradicated from within. ||3||
Those whom the Primal Lord keeps united in His Union,
shall never be separated from Him; they are merged in the Word of the Shabad.
Only God Himself knows His own power.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh realizes the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||6||
Dhanaasaree, Third Mehl:
The ignorant fools amass false wealth.
The blind, foolish, self-willed manmukhs have gone astray.
Poisonous wealth brings constant pain.
It will not go with you, and it will not yield any profit. ||1||
True wealth is obtained through the Guru's Teachings.
False wealth continues coming and going. ||Pause||
The foolish self-willed manmukhs all go astray and die.
They drown in the terrifying world-ocean, and they cannot reach either this shore, or the one beyond.
But by perfect destiny, they meet the True Guru;
imbued with the True Name, day and night, they remain detached from the world. ||2||
Throughout the four ages, the True Bani of His Word is Ambrosial Nectar.
By perfect destiny, one is absorbed in the True Name.
The Siddhas, the seekers and all men long for the Name.
It is obtained only by perfect destiny. ||3||
The True Lord is everything; He is True.
Only a few realize the exalted Lord God.
He is the Truest of the True; He Himself implants the True Name within.
