Cursed is emotional attachment and love of Maya; no one is seen to be at peace. ||1||Pause||
God is Wise, Giving, Tender-hearted, Pure, Beautiful and Infinite.
He is our Companion and Helper, Supremely Great, Lofty and Utterly Infinite.
He is not known as young or old; His Court is Steady and Stable.
Whatever we seek from Him, we receive. He is the Support of the unsupported. ||2||
Seeing Him, our evil inclinations vanish; mind and body become peaceful and tranquil.
With one-pointed mind, meditate on the One Lord, and the doubts of your mind will be dispelled.
He is the Treasure of Excellence, the Ever-fresh Being. His Gift is Perfect and Complete.
Forever and ever, worship and adore Him. Day and night, do not forget Him. ||3||
One whose destiny is so pre-ordained, obtains the Lord of the Universe as his Companion.
I dedicate my body, mind, wealth and all to Him. I totally sacrifice my soul to Him.
Seeing and hearing, He is always close at hand. In each and every heart, God is pervading.
Even the ungrateful ones are cherished by God. O Nanak, He is forever the Forgiver. ||4||13||83||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
This mind, body and wealth were given by God, who naturally adorns us.
He has blessed us with all our energy, and infused His Infinite Light deep within us.
Forever and ever, meditate in remembrance on God; keep Him enshrined in your heart. ||1||
O my mind, without the Lord, there is no other at all.
Remain in God's Sanctuary forever, and no suffering shall afflict you. ||1||Pause||
Jewels, treasures, pearls, gold and silver-all these are just dust.
Mother, father, children and relatives-all relations are false.
The self-willed manmukh is an insulting beast; he does not acknowledge the One who created him. ||2||
The Lord is pervading within and beyond, and yet people think that He is far away.
They are engrossed in clinging desires; within their hearts there is ego and falsehood.
Without devotion to the Naam, crowds of people come and go. ||3||
Please preserve Your beings and creatures, God; O Creator Lord, please be merciful!
Without God, there is no saving grace. The Messenger of Death is cruel and unfeeling.
O Nanak, may I never forget the Naam! Please bless me with Your Mercy, Lord! ||4||14||84||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
My body and my wealth; my ruling power, my beautiful form and country-mine!
You may have children, a wife and many mistresses; you may enjoy all sorts of pleasures and fine clothes.
And yet, if the Name of the Lord does not abide within the heart, none of it has any use or value. ||1||
O my mind, meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
Always keep the Company of the Holy, and focus your consciousness on the Feet of the Guru. ||1||Pause||
Those who have such blessed destiny written on their foreheads meditate on the Treasure of the Naam.
All their affairs are brought to fruition, holding onto the Guru's Feet.
The diseases of ego and doubt are cast out; they shall not come and go in reincarnation. ||2||
Let the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, be your cleansing baths at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage.
Your soul, breath of life, mind and body shall blossom forth in lush profusion; this is the true purpose of life.
