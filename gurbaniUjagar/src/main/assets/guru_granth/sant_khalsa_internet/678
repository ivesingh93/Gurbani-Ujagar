Nanak begs God for the gift of the dust of the feet of the Saints. ||4||3||27||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
The One who sent you, has now recalled you; return to your home now in peace and pleasure.
In bliss and ecstasy, sing His Glorious Praises; by this celestial tune, you shall acquire your everlasting kingdom. ||1||
Come back to your home, O my friend.
The Lord Himself has eliminated your enemies, and your misfortunes are past. ||Pause||
God, the Creator Lord, has glorified you, and your running and rushing around has ended.
In your home, there is rejoicing; the musical instruments continually play, and your Husband Lord has exalted you. ||2||
Remain firm and steady, and do not ever waver; take the Guru's Word as your Support.
You shall be applauded and congratulated all over the world, and your face shall be radiant in the Court of the Lord. ||3||
All beings belong to Him; He Himself transforms them, and He Himself becomes their help and support.
The Creator Lord has worked a wondrous miracle; O Nanak, His glorious greatness is true. ||4||4||28||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl, Sixth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Listen, O Dear Beloved Saints, to my prayer.
Without the Lord, no one is liberated. ||Pause||
O mind, do only deeds of purity; the Lord is the only boat to carry you across. Other entanglements shall be of no use to you.
True living is serving the Divine, Supreme Lord God; the Guru has imparted this teaching to me. ||1||
Do not fall in love with trivial things; in the end, they shall not go along with you.
Worship and adore the Lord with your mind and body, O Beloved Saint of the Lord; in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, you shall be released from bondage. ||2||
In your heart, hold fast to the Sanctuary of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord God; do not place your hopes in any other support.
He alone is a devotee, spiritually wise, a meditator, and a penitent, O Nanak, who is blessed by the Lord's Mercy. ||3||1||29||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
O my dear beloved, it is good, it is better, it is best, to ask for the Lord's Name.
Behold, with your eyes wide-open, and listen to the Words of the Holy Saints; enshrine in your consciousness the Lord of Life - remember that all must die. ||Pause||
The application of sandalwood oil, the enjoyment of pleasures and the practice of many corrupt sins - look upon all of these as insipid and worthless. The Name of the Lord of the Universe alone is sublime; so say the Holy Saints.
You claim that your body and wealth are your own; you do not chant the Lord's Name even for an instant. Look and see, that none of your possessions or riches shall go along with you. ||1||
One who has good karma, grasps the Protection of the hem of the Saints' robe; in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the Messenger of Death cannot threaten him.
I have obtained the supreme treasure, and my egotism has been eradicated; Nanak's mind is attached to the One Formless Lord. ||2||2||30||
