Bhairao, Third Mehl, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The Creator has staged His Wondrous Play.
I listen to the Unstruck Sound-current of the Shabad, and the Bani of His Word.
The self-willed manmukhs are deluded and confused, while the Gurmukhs understand.
The Creator creates the Cause that causes. ||1||
Deep within my being, I meditate on the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
I shall never forsake the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Prahlaad's father sent him to school, to learn to read.
He took his writing tablet and went to the teacher.
He said, "I shall not read anything except the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Write the Lord's Name on my tablet."||2||
Prahlaad's mother said to her son,
I advise you not to read anything except what you are taught.
He answered, "The Great Giver, my Fearless Lord God is always with me.
If I were to forsake the Lord, then my family would be disgraced."||3||
Prahlaad has corrupted all the other students.
He does not listen to what I say, and he does his own thing.
He instigated devotional worship in the townspeople.
The gathering of the wicked people could not do anything against him. ||4||
Sanda and Marka, his teachers, made the complaint.
All the demons kept trying in vain.
The Lord protected His humble devotee, and preserved his honor.
What can be done by mere created beings? ||5||
Because of his past karma, the demon ruled over his kingdom.
He did not realize the Lord; the Lord Himself confused him.
He started an argument with his son Prahlaad.
The blind one did not understand that his death was approaching. ||6||
Prahlaad was placed in a cell, and the door was locked.
The fearless child was not afraid at all. He said, "Within my being, is the Guru, the Lord of the World.
The created being tried to compete with his Creator, but he assumed this name in vain.
That which was predestined for him has come to pass; he started an argument with the Lord's humble servant. ||7||
The father raised the club to strike down Prahlaad, saying,
Where is your God, the Lord of the Universe, now?
He replied, "The Life of the World, the Great Giver, is my Help and Support in the end.
Wherever I look, I see Him permeating and prevailing."||8||
Tearing down the pillars, the Lord Himself appeared.
The egotistical demon was killed and destroyed.
The minds of the devotees were filled with bliss, and congratulations poured in.
He blessed His servant with glorious greatness. ||9||
He created birth, death and attachment.
The Creator has ordained coming and going in reincarnation.
For the sake of Prahlaad, the Lord Himself appeared.
The word of the devotee came true. ||10||
The gods proclaimed the victory of Lakshmi, and said,
O mother, make this form of the Man-lion disappear!
Lakshmi was afraid, and did not approach.
