Those Saints who know You, O Lord and Master - blessed and approved is their coming into the world.
The Congregation of those humble beings is obtained by great good fortune; Nanak is a sacrifice to the Saints. ||2||41||64||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Save me, O Merciful Saint!
You are the All-powerful Cause of causes. You have ended my separation, and joined me with God. ||1||Pause||
You save us from the corruption and sins of countless incarnations; associating with You, we obtain sublime understanding.
Forgetting God, we wandered through countless incarnations; with each and every breath, we sing the Lord's Praises. ||1||
Whoever meets with the Holy Saints - those sinners are sanctified.
Says Nanak, those who have such high destiny, win this invaluable human life. ||2||42||65||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
O my Lord and Master, Your humble servant has come to offer this prayer.
Hearing Your Name, I am blessed with total peace, bliss, poise and pleasure. ||1||Pause||
The Treasure of Mercy, the Ocean of Peace - His Praises are diffused everywhere.
O Lord, You celebrate in the Society of the Saints; You reveal Yourself to them. ||1||
With my eyes I see the Saints, and dedicate myself to serving them; I wash their feet with my hair.
Twenty-four hours a day, I gaze upon the Blessed Vision, the Darshan of the Saints; this is the peace and comfort which Nanak has received. ||2||43||66||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
One who is lovingly absorbed in the Lord's Name
is a good-hearted friend, intuitively embellished with happiness. He is said to be blessed and fortunate. ||1||Pause||
He is rid of sin and corruption, and detached from Maya; he has renounced the poison of egotistical intellect.
He thirsts for the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, and he places his hopes in the One Lord alone. The Feet of his Beloved are the Support of his heart. ||1||
He sleeps, wakes, rises up and sits down without anxiety; he laughs and cries without anxiety.
Says Nanak, she who has cheated the world - that Maya is cheated by the humble servant of the Lord. ||2||44||67||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Now, no one complains about the Lord's humble servant.
Whoever tries to complain is destroyed by the Guru, the Transcendent Lord God. ||1||Pause||
Whoever harbors vengeance against the One who is beyond all vengeance, shall lose in the Court of the Lord.
From the very beginning of time, and throughout the ages, it is the glorious greatness of God, that He preserves the honor of His humble servants. ||1||
The mortal becomes fearless, and all his fears are taken away, when he leans on the Support of the Lord's Lotus Feet.
Chanting the Name, through the Guru's Word, Nanak has become famous throughout the world. ||2||45||68||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
The Lord's humble servant has discarded all self-conceit.
As You see fit, You save us, O Lord of the World. Beholding Your Glorious Grandeur, I live. ||1||Pause||
Through the Guru's Instruction, and the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, all sorrow and suffering is taken away.
I look upon friend and enemy alike; all that I speak is the Lord's meditation. ||1||
The fire within me is quenched; I am cool, calm and tranquil. Hearing the unstruck celestial melody, I am wonder-struck and amazed.
I am in ecstasy, O Nanak, and my mind is filled with Truth, through the perfect perfection of the Sound-current of the Naad. ||2||46||69||
