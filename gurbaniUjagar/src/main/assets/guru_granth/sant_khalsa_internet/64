The whole world is a store-house of lamp-black; the body and mind are blackened with it.
Those who are saved by the Guru are immaculate and pure; through the Word of the Shabad, they extinguish the fire of desire. ||7||
O Nanak, they swim across with the True Name of the Lord, the King above the heads of kings.
May I never forget the Name of the Lord! I have purchased the Jewel of the Lord's Name.
The self-willed manmukhs putrefy and dIE in the terrifying world-ocean, while the Gurmukhs cross over the bottomless ocean. ||8||16||
Siree Raag, First Mehl, Second House:
They have made this their resting place and they sit at home, but the urge to depart is always there.
This would be known as a lasting place of rest, only if they were to remain stable and unchanging. ||1||
What sort of a resting place is this world?
Doing deeds of faith, pack up the supplies for your journey, and remain committed to the Name. ||1||Pause||
The Yogis sit in their Yogic postures, and the Mullahs sit at their resting stations.
The Hindu Pandits recite from their books, and the Siddhas sit in the temples of their gods. ||2||
The angels, Siddhas, worshippers of Shiva, heavenly musicians, silent sages, Saints, pirEsts, preachers, spiritual teachers and commanders -
each and every one has left, and all others shall depart as well. ||3||
The sultans and kings, the rich and the mighty, have marched away in succession.
In a moment or two, we shall also depart. O my heart, understand that you must go as well! ||4||
This is described in the Shabads; only a few understand this!
Nanak offers this prayer to the One who pervades the water, the land and the air. ||5||
He is Allah, the Unknowable, the Inaccessible, All-powerful and Merciful Creator.
All the world comes and goes-only the Merciful Lord is permanent. ||6||
Call permanent only the One, who does not have destiny inscribed upon His Forehead.
The sky and the earth shall pass away; He alone is permanent. ||7||
The day and the sun shall pass away; the night and the moon shall pass away; the hundreds of thousands of stars shall disappear.
He alone is permanent; Nanak speaks the Truth. ||8||17||
Seventeen Ashtapadees Of The First Mehl.
Siree Raag, Third Mehl, First House, Ashtapadees:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
By God's Grace, the Gurmukh practices devotion; without the Guru, there is no devotional worship.
One who merges his own self into Him understands, and so becomes pure.
The Dear Lord is True, and True is the Word of His Bani. Through the Word of the Shabad, Union with Him is obtained. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, without devotion, why have people even come into the world?
They have not served the Perfect Guru; they have wasted their lives in vain. ||1||Pause||
The Lord Himself, the Life of the World, is the Giver. He Himself forgives, and unites us with Himself.
What are these poor beings and creatures? What can they speak and say?
God Himself grants glory to the Gurmukhs; He joins them to His Service. ||2||
Beholding your family, you are lured away by emotional attachment, but when you leave, they will not go with you.
