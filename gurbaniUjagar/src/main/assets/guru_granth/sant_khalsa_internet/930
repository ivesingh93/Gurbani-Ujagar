Ongkaar saves the world through the Shabad.
Ongkaar saves the Gurmukhs.
Listen to the Message of the Universal, Imperishable Creator Lord.
The Universal, Imperishable Creator Lord is the essence of the three worlds. ||1||
Listen, O Pandit, O religious scholar, why are you writing about worldly debates?
As Gurmukh, write only the Name of the Lord, the Lord of the World. ||1||Pause||
Sassa: He created the entire universe with ease; His One Light pervades the three worlds.
Become Gurmukh, and obtain the real thing; gather the gems and pearls.
If one understands, realizes and comprehends what he reads and studies, in the end he shall realize that the True Lord dwells deep within his nucleus.
The Gurmukh sees and contemplates the True Lord; without the True Lord, the world is false. ||2||
Dhadha: Those who enshrine Dharmic faith and dwell in the City of Dharma are worthy; their minds are steadfast and stable.
Dhadha: If the dust of their feet touches one's face and forehead, he is transformed from iron into gold.
Blessed is the Support of the Earth; He Himself is not born; His measure and speech are perfect and True.
Only the Creator Himself knows His own extent; He alone knows the Brave Guru. ||3||
In love with duality, spiritual wisdom is lost; the mortal rots away in pride, and eats poison.
He thinks that the sublime essence of the Guru's song is useless, and he does not like to hear it. He loses the profound, unfathomable Lord.
Through the Guru's Words of Truth, the Ambrosial Nectar is obtained, and the mind and body find joy in the True Lord.
He Himself is the Gurmukh, and He Himself bestows the Ambrosial Nectar; He Himself leads us to drink it in. ||4||
Everyone says that God is the One and only, but they are engrossed in egotism and pride.
Realize that the One God is inside and outside; understand this, that the Mansion of His Presence is within the home of your heart.
God is near at hand; do not think that God is far away. The One Lord permeates the entire universe.
There in One Universal Creator Lord; there is no other at all. O Nanak, merge into the One Lord. ||5||
How can you keep the Creator under your control? He cannot be seized or measured.
Maya has made the mortal insane; she has administered the poisonous drug of falsehood.
Addicted to greed and avarice, the mortal is ruined, and then later, he regrets and repents.
So serve the One Lord, and attain the state of Salvation; your comings and goings shall cease. ||6||
The One Lord is in all actions, colors and forms.
He manifests in many shapes through wind, water and fire.
The One Soul wanders through the three worlds.
One who understands and comprehends the One Lord is honored.
One who gathers in spiritual wisdom and meditation, dwells in the state of balance.
How rare are those who, as Gurmukh, attain the One Lord.
They alone find peace, whom the Lord blesses with His Grace.
In the Gurdwara, the Guru's Door, they speak and hear of the Lord. ||7||
His Light illuminates the ocean and the earth.
Throughout the three worlds, is the Guru, the Lord of the World.
The Lord reveals His various forms;
granting His Grace, He enters the home of the heart.
The clouds hang low, and the rain is pouring down.
The Lord embellishes and exalts with the Sublime Word of the Shabad.
One who knows the mystery of the One God,
is Himself the Creator, Himself the Divine Lord. ||8||
When the sun rises, the demons are slain;
the mortal looks upwards, and contemplates the Shabad.
The Lord is beyond the beginning and the end, beyond the three worlds.
He Himself acts, speaks and listens.
