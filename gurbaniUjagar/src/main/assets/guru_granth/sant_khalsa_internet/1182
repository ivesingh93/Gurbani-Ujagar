Save me, O my Merciful Lord God. ||1||Pause||
I have not practiced meditation, austerities or good actions.
I do not know the way to meet You.
Within my mind, I have placed my hopes in the One Lord alone.
The Support of Your Name shall carry me across. ||2||
You are the Expert, O God, in all powers.
The fish cannot find the limits of the water.
You are Inaccessible and Unfathomable, the Highest of the High.
I am small, and You are so very Great. ||3||
Those who meditate on You are wealthy.
Those who attain You are rich.
Those who serve You are peaceful.
Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Saints. ||4||7||
Basant, Fifth Mehl:
Serve the One who created You.
Worship the One who gave you life.
Become His servant, and you shall never again be punished.
Become His trustee, and you shall never again suffer sorrow. ||1||
That mortal who is blessed with such great good fortune,
attains this state of Nirvaanaa. ||1||Pause||
Life is wasted uselessly in the service of duality.
No efforts shall be rewarded, and no works brought to fruition.
It is so painful to serve only mortal beings.
Service to the Holy brings lasting peace and bliss. ||2||
If you long for eternal peace, O Siblings of Destiny,
then join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; this is the Guru's advice.
There, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is meditated on.
In the Saadh Sangat, you shall be emancipated. ||3||
Among all essences, this is the essence of spiritual wisdom.
Among all meditations, meditation on the One Lord is the most sublime.
The Kirtan of the Lord's Praises is the ultimate melody.
Meeting with the Guru, Nanak sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||4||8||
Basant, Fifth Mehl:
Chanting His Name, one's mouth becomes pure.
Meditating in remembrance on Him, one's reputation becomes stainless.
Worshipping Him in adoration, one is not tortured by the Messenger of Death.
Serving Him, everything is obtained. ||1||
The Lord's Name - chant the Lord's Name.
Abandon all the desires of your mind. ||1||Pause||
He is the Support of the earth and the sky.
His Light illuminates each and every heart.
Meditating in remembrance on Him, even fallen sinners are sanctified;
in the end, they will not weep and wail over and over again. ||2||
Among all religions, this is the ultimate religion.
Among all rituals and codes of conduct, this is above all.
The angels, mortals and divine beings long for Him.
To find Him, commit yourself to the service of the Society of the Saints. ||3||
One whom the Primal Lord God blesses with His bounties,
obtains the treasure of the Lord.
His state and extent cannot be described.
Servant Nanak meditates on the Lord, Har, Har. ||4||9||
Basant, Fifth Mehl:
My mind and body are gripped by thirst and desire.
The Merciful Guru has fulfilled my hopes.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, all my sins have been taken away.
I chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord; I am in love with the Name of the Lord. ||1||
By Guru's Grace, this spring of the soul has come.
I enshrine the Lord's Lotus Feet within my heart; I listen to the Lord's Praise, forever and ever. ||1||Pause||
