Your Will seems so sweet to me; whatever You do, is pleasing to me.
Whatever You give me, with that I am satisfied; I shall chase after no one else. ||2||
I know that my Lord and Master God is always with me; I am the dust of all men's feet.
If I find the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I shall obtain God. ||3||
Forever and ever, I am Your child; You are my God, my King.
Nanak is Your child; You are my mother and father; please, give me Your Name, like milk in my mouth. ||4||3||5||
Todee, Fifth Mehl, Second House, Du-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
I beg for the Gift of Your Name, O my Lord and Master.
Nothing else shall go along with me in the end; by Your Grace, please allow me to sing Your Glorious Praises. ||1||Pause||
Power, wealth, various pleasures and enjoyments, all are just like the shadow of a tree.
He runs, runs, runs around in many directions, but all of his pursuits are useless. ||1||
Except for the Lord of the Universe, everything he desires appears transitory.
Says Nanak, I beg for the dust of the feet of the Saints, so that my mind may find peace and tranquility. ||2||1||6||
Todee, Fifth Mehl:
The Naam, the Name of the Dear Lord, is the Support of my mind.
It is my life, my breath of life, my peace of mind; for me, it is an article of daily use. ||1||Pause||
The Naam is my social status, the Naam is my honor; the Naam is my family.
The Naam is my companion; it is always with me. The Lord's Name is my emancipation. ||1||
Sensual pleasures are talked about a lot, but none of them goes along with anyone in the end.
The Naam is Nanak's dearest friend; the Lord's Name is my treasure. ||2||2||7||
Todee, Fifth Mehl:
Sing the sublime Praises of the Lord, and your disease shall be eradicated.
Your face shall become radiant and bright, and your mind shall be immaculately pure. You shall be saved here and hereafter. ||1||Pause||
I wash the Guru's feet and serve Him; I dedicate my mind as an offering to Him.
Renounce self-conceit, negativity and egotism, and accept what comes to pass. ||1||
He alone commits himself to the service of the Saints, upon whose forehead such destiny is inscribed.
Says Nanak, other than the One Lord, there is not any other able to act. ||2||3||8||
Todee, Fifth Mehl:
O True Guru, I have come to Your Sanctuary.
Grant me the peace and glory of the Lord's Name, and remove my anxiety. ||1||Pause||
I cannot see any other place of shelter; I have grown weary, and collapsed at Your door.
Please ignore my account; only then may I be saved. I am worthless - please, save me! ||1||
You are always forgiving, and always merciful; You give support to all.
Slave Nanak follows the Path of the Saints; save him, O Lord, this time. ||2||4||9||
Todee, Fifth Mehl:
My tongue sings the Praises of the Lord of the world, the ocean of virtue.
Peace, tranquility, poise and delight well up in my mind, and all sorrows run away. ||1||Pause||
