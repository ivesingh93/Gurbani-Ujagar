Raag Tilang, First Mehl, First House:
One Universal Creator God. Truth Is The Name. Creative Being Personified. No Fear. No Hatred. Image Of The Undying. Beyond Birth. Self-Existent. By Guru's Grace:
I offer this one prayer to You; please listen to it, O Creator Lord.
You are true, great, merciful and spotless, O Cherisher Lord. ||1||
The world is a transitory place of mortality - know this for certain in your mind.
Azraa-eel, the Messenger of Death, has caught me by the hair on my head, and yet, I do not know it at all in my mind. ||1||Pause||
Spouse, children, parents and siblings - none of them will be there to hold your hand.
And when at last I fall, and the time of my last prayer has come, there shall be no one to rescue me. ||2||
Night and day, I wandered around in greed, contemplating evil schemes.
I never did good deeds; this is my condition. ||3||
I am unfortunate, miserly, negligent, shameless and without the Fear of God.
Says Nanak, I am Your humble servant, the dust of the feet of Your slaves. ||4||1||
Tilang, First Mehl, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The Fear of You, O Lord God, is my marijuana; my consciousness is the pouch which holds it.
I have become an intoxicated hermit.
My hands are my begging bowl; I am so hungry for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.
I beg at Your Door, day after day. ||1||
I long for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.
I am a beggar at Your Door - please bless me with Your charity. ||1||Pause||
Saffron, flowers, musk oil and gold embellish the bodies of all.
The Lord's devotees are like sandalwood, which imparts its fragrance to everyone. ||2||
No one says that ghee or silk are polluted.
Such is the Lord's devotee, no matter what his social status is.
Those who bow in reverence to the Naam, the Name of the Lord, remain absorbed in Your Love.
Nanak begs for charity at their door. ||3||1||2||
Tilang, First Mehl, Third House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
This body fabric is conditioned by Maya, O beloved; this cloth is dyed in greed.
