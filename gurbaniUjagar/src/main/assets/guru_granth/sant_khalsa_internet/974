O Divine Lord, the knot of skepticism cannot be untied.
Sexual desire, anger, Maya, intoxication and jealousy - these five have combined to plunder the world. ||1||Pause||
I am a great poet, of noble heritage; I am a Pandit, a religious scholar, a Yogi and a Sannyaasi;
I am a spiritual teacher, a warrior and a giver - such thinking never ends. ||2||
Says Ravi Daas, no one understands; they all run around, deluded like madmen.
The Lord's Name is my only Support; He is my life, my breath of life, my wealth. ||3||1||
Raamkalee, The Word Of Baynee Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The energy channels of the Ida, Pingala and Shushmanaa: these three dwell in one place.
This is the true place of confluence of the three sacred rivers: this is where my mind takes its cleansing bath. ||1||
O Saints, the Immaculate Lord dwells there;
how rare are those who go to the Guru, and understand this.
The all-pervading immaculate Lord is there. ||1||Pause||
What is the insignia of the Divine Lord's dwelling?
The unstruck sound current of the Shabad vibrates there.
There is no moon or sun, no air or water there.
The Gurmukh becomes aware, and knows the Teachings. ||2||
Spiritual wisdom wells up, and evil-mindedness departs;
the nucleus of the mind sky is drenched with Ambrosial Nectar.
One who knows the secret of this device,
meets the Supreme Divine Guru. ||3||
The Tenth Gate is the home of the inaccessible, infinite Supreme Lord.
Above the store is a niche, and within this niche is the commodity. ||4||
One who remains awake, never sleeps.
The three qualities and the three worlds vanish, in the state of Samaadhi.
He takes the Beej Mantra, the Seed Mantra, and keeps it in his heart.
Turning his mind away from the world, he focuses on the cosmic void of the absolute Lord. ||5||
He remains awake, and he does not lie.
He keeps the five sensory organs under his control.
He cherishes in his consciousness the Guru's Teachings.
He dedicates his mind and body to the Lord's Love. ||6||
He considers his hands to be the leaves and branches of the tree.
He does not lose his life in the gamble.
He plugs up the source of the river of evil tendencies.
Turning away from the west, he makes the sun rise in the east.
He bears the unbearable, and the drops trickle down within;
then, he speaks with the Lord of the world. ||7||
The four-sided lamp illuminates the Tenth Gate.
The Primal Lord is at the center of the countless leaves.
He Himself abides there with all His powers.
He weaves the jewels into the pearl of the mind. ||8||
The lotus is at the forehead, and the jewels surround it.
Within it is the Immaculate Lord, the Master of the three worlds.
The Panch Shabad, the five primal sounds, resound and vibrate their in their purity.
The chauris - the fly brushes wave, and the conch shells blare like thunder.
The Gurmukh tramples the demons underfoot with his spiritual wisdom.
Baynee longs for Your Name, Lord. ||9||1||
