Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
You have made it your habit to practice those deeds which will bring you shame.
You slander the Saints, and you worship the faithless cynics; such are the corrupt ways you have adopted. ||1||
Deluded by your emotional attachment to Maya, you love other things,
like the enchanted city of Hari-chandauree, or the green leaves of the forest - such is your way of life. ||1||Pause||
Its body may be anointed with sandalwood oil, but the donkey still loves to roll in the mud.
He is not fond of the Ambrosial Nectar; instead, he loves the poisonous drug of corruption. ||2||
The Saints are noble and sublime; they are blessed with good fortune. They alone are pure and holy in this world.
The jewel of this human life is passing away uselessly, lost in exchange for mere glass. ||3||
The sins and sorrows of uncounted incarnations run away, when the Guru applies the healing ointment of spiritual wisdom to the eyes.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I have escaped from these troubles; Nanak loves the One Lord. ||4||9||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
I carry the water, wave the fan, and grind the corn for the Saints; I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe.
With each and every breath, my mind remembers the Naam, the Name of the Lord; in this way, it finds the treasure of peace. ||1||
Have pity on me, O my Lord and Master.
Bless me with such understanding, O my Lord and Master, that I may forever and ever meditate on You. ||1||Pause||
By Your Grace, emotional attachment and egotism are eradicated, and doubt is dispelled.
The Lord, the embodiment of bliss, is pervading and permeating in all; wherever I go, there I see Him. ||2||
You are kind and compassionate, the treasure of mercy, the Purifier of sinners, Lord of the world.
I obtain millions of joys, comforts and kingdoms, if You inspire me to chant Your Name with my mouth, even for an instant. ||3||
That alone is perfect chanting, meditation, penance and devotional worship service, which is pleasing to God's Mind.
Chanting the Naam, all thirst and desire is satisfied; Nanak is satisfied and fulfilled. ||4||10||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
She controls the three qualities and the four directions of the world.
She destroys sacrificial feasts, cleansing baths, penances and sacred places of pilgrimage; what is this poor person to do? ||1||
I grasped God's Support and Protection, and then I was emancipated.
By the Grace of the Holy Saints, I sang the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har, Har, and my sins and afflictions were taken away. ||1||Pause||
She is not heard - she does not speak with a mouth; she is not seen enticing mortals.
She administers her intoxicating drug, and so confuses them; thus she seems sweet to everyone's mind. ||2||
In each and every home, she has implanted the sense of duality in mother, father, children, friends and siblings.
Some have more, and some have less; they fight and fight, to the death. ||3||
I am a sacrifice to my True Guru, who has shown me this wondrous play.
The world is being consumed by this hidden fire, but Maya does not cling to the Lord's devotees. ||4||
By the Grace of the Saints, I have obtained supreme bliss, and all my bonds have been broken.
Nanak has obtained the wealth of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; having earned his profits, he has now returned home. ||5||11||
Dhanaasaree, Fifth Mehl:
You are the Giver, O Lord, O Cherisher, my Master, my Husband Lord.
