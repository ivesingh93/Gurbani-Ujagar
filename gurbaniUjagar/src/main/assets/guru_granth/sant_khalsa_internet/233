The mind is attuned to the Word of the Shabad; it is lovingly attuned to the Lord.
It abides within its own home, in harmony with the Lord's Will. ||1||
Serving the True Guru, egotistical pride departs,
and the Lord of the Universe, the Treasure of Excellence, is obtained. ||1||Pause||
The mind becomes detached and free of desire, when it experiences the Fear of God, through the Shabad.
My Immaculate God is pervading and contained among all.
By Guru's Grace, one is united in His Union. ||2||
The slave of the Lord's slave attains peace.
My Lord God is found in this way.
By the Grace of the Lord, one comes to sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||3||
Cursed is that long life, during which love for the Lord's Name is not enshrined.
Cursed is that comfortable bed which lures one into the darkness of attachment to sexual desire.
Fruitful is the birth of that person who takes the Support of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||
Cursed, cursed is that home and family, in which the love of the Lord is not embraced.
He alone is my friend, who sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
Without the Lord's Name, there is no other for me. ||5||
From the True Guru, I have obtained salvation and honor.
I have meditated on the Name of the Lord, and all my sufferings have been erased.
I am in constant bliss, lovingly attuned to the Lord's Name. ||6||
Meeting the Guru, I came to understand my body.
The fires of ego and desire have been totally quenched.
Anger has been dispelled, and I have grasped hold of tolerance. ||7||
The Lord Himself showers His Mercy, and bestows the Naam.
How rare is that Gurmukh, who receives the jewel of the Naam.
O Nanak, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, the Unknowable, the Incomprehensible. ||8||8||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Raag Gauree Bairaagan, Third Mehl:
Those who turn their faces away from the True Guru, are seen to be unfaithful and evil.
They shall be bound and beaten night and day; they shall not have this opportunity again. ||1||
O Lord, please shower Your Mercy upon me, and save me!
O Lord God, please lead me to meet the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, that I may dwell upon the Glorious Praises of the Lord within my heart. ||1||Pause||
Those devotees are pleasing to the Lord, who as Gurmukh, walk in harmony with the Way of the Lord's Will.
Subduing their selfishness and conceit, and performing selfless service, they remain dead while yet alive. ||2||
The body and the breath of life belong to the One - perform the greatest service to Him.
Why forget Him from your mind? Keep the Lord enshrined in your heart. ||3||
Receiving the Naam, the Name of the Lord, one obtains honor; believing in the Naam, one is at peace.
The Naam is obtained from the True Guru; by His Grace, God is found. ||4||
They turn their faces away from the True Guru; they continue to wander aimlessly.
They are not accepted by the earth or the sky; they fall into manure, and rot. ||5||
This world is deluded by doubt - it has taken the drug of emotional attachment.
Maya does not draw near those who have met with the True Guru. ||6||
Those who serve the True Guru are very beautiful; they cast off the filth of selfishness and conceit.
