Without the True Guru, no one has found Him; reflect upon this in your mind and see.
The filth of the self-willed manmukhs is not washed off; they have no love for the Guru's Shabad. ||1||
O my mind, walk in harmony with the True Guru.
Dwell within the home of your own inner being, and drink in the Ambrosial Nectar; you shall attain the Peace of the Mansion of His Presence. ||1||Pause||
The unvirtuous have no merit; they are not allowed to sit in His Presence.
The self-willed manmukhs do not know the Shabad; those without virtue are far removed from God.
Those who recognize the True One are permeated and attuned to Truth.
Their minds are pierced through by the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and God Himself ushers them into His Presence. ||2||
He Himself dyes us in the Color of His Love; through the Word of His Shabad, He unites us with Himself.
This True Color shall not fade away, for those who are attuned to His Love.
The self-willed manmukhs grow weary of wandering around in all four directions, but they do not understand.
One who is united with the True Guru, meets and merges in the True Word of the Shabad. ||3||
I have grown weary of making so many friends, hoping that someone might be able to end my suffering.
Meeting with my Beloved, my suffering has ended; I have attained Union with the Word of the Shabad.
Earning Truth, and accumulating the Wealth of Truth, the truthful person gains a reputation of Truth.
Meeting with the True One, O Nanak, the Gurmukh shall not be separated from Him again. ||4||26||59||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
The Creator Himself created the Creation; He produced the Universe, and He Himself watches over it.
The One and Only Lord is pervading and permeating all. The Unseen cannot be seen.
God Himself is Merciful; He Himself bestows understanding.
Through the Guru's Teachings, the True One dwells forever in the mind of those who remain lovingly attached to Him. ||1||
O my mind, surrender to the Guru's Will.
Mind and body are totally cooled and soothed, and the Naam comes to dwell in the mind. ||1||Pause||
Having created the creation, He supports it and takes care of it.
The Word of the Guru's Shabad is realized, when He Himself bestows His Glance of Grace.
Those who are beautifully adorned with the Shabad in the Court of the True Lord -
those Gurmukhs are attuned to the True Word of the Shabad; the Creator unites them with Himself. ||2||
Through the Guru's Teachings, praise the True One, who has no end or limitation.
He dwells in each and every heart, by the Hukam of His Command; by His Hukam, we contemplate Him.
So praise Him through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and drive out egotism from within.
That soul-bride who lacks the Lord's Name acts without virtue, and so she grieves. ||3||
Praising the True One, attached to the True One, I am satisfied with the True Name.
Contemplating His Virtues, I accumulate virtue and merit; I wash myself clean of demerits.
He Himself unites us in His Union; there is no more separation.
O Nanak, I sing the Praises of my Guru; through Him, I find that God. ||4||27||60||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Listen, listen, O soul-bride: you are overtaken by sexual desire-why do you walk like that, swinging your arms in joy?
You do not recognize your own Husband Lord! When you go to Him, what face will you show Him?
I touch the feet of my sister soul-brides who have known their Husband Lord.
If only I could be like them! Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, I am united in His Union. ||1||
