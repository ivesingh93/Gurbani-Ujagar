Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
He sings the song of the One Universal Creator; he sings the tune of the One Lord.
He lives in the land of the One Lord, shows the way to the One Lord, and remains attuned to the One Lord.
He centers his consciousness on the One Lord, and serves only the One Lord, who is known through the Guru. ||1||
Blessed and good is such a kirtanee, who sings such Praises.
He sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord,
and renounces the entanglements and pursuits of Maya. ||1||Pause||
He makes the five virtues, like contentment, his musical instruments, and plays the seven notes of the love of the Lord.
The notes he plays are the renunciation of pride and power; his feet keep the beat on the straight path.
He does not enter the cycle of reincarnation ever again; he keeps the One Word of the Shabad tied to the hem of his robe. ||2||
To play like Naarad, is to know that the Lord is ever-present.
The tinkling of the ankle bells is the shedding of sorrows and worries.
The dramatic gestures of acting are celestial bliss.
Such a dancer is not reincarnated again. ||3||
If anyone, becomes pleasing to his Lord and Master,
out of millions of people, he sings the Lord's Praises in this way.
I have taken the Support of the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
Says Nanak, the Kirtan of the One Lord's Praises are sung there. ||4||8||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
Some call Him, 'Raam, Raam', and some call Him, 'Khudaa-i'.
Some serve Him as 'Gusain', others as 'Allah'. ||1||
He is the Cause of causes, the Generous Lord.
He showers His Grace and Mercy upon us. ||1||Pause||
Some bathe at sacred shrines of pilgrimage, and some make the pilgrimage to Mecca.|
Some perform devotional worship services, and some bow their heads in prayer. ||2||
Some read the Vedas, and some the Koran.
Some wear blue robes, and some wear white. ||3||
Some call themselves Muslim, and some call themselves Hindu.
Some yearn for paradise, and others long for heaven. ||4||
Says Nanak, one who realizes the Hukam of God's Will,
knows the secrets of his Lord and Master. ||5||9||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
The wind merges into the wind.
The light blends into the light.
The dust becomes one with the dust.
What support is there for the one who is lamenting? ||1||
Who has died? O, who has died?
O God-realized beings, meet together and consider this. What a wondrous thing has happened! ||1||Pause||
No one knows what happens after death.
The one who is lamenting will also arise and depart.
Mortal beings are bound by the bonds of doubt and attachment.
When life becomes a dream, the blind man babbles and grieves in vain. ||2||
The Creator Lord created this creation.
It comes and goes, subject to the Will of the Infinite Lord.
No one dies; no one is capable of dying.
The soul does not perish; it is imperishable. ||3||
That which is known, does not exist.
I am a sacrifice to the one who knows this.
Says Nanak, the Guru has dispelled my doubt.
No one dies; no one comes or goes. ||4||10||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
Meditate on the Lord of the Universe, the Beloved Lord of the World.
Meditating in remembrance on the Lord's Name, you shall live, and the Great Death shall not consume you ever again. ||1||Pause||
Through millions of incarnations, you have come, wandering, wandering, wandering.
