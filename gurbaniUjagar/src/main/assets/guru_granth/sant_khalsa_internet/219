One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Raag Gauree, Ninth Mehl
: Holy Saadhus: forsake the pride of your mind.
Sexual desire, anger and the company of evil people - run away from them, day and night. ||1||Pause||
One who knows that pain and pleasure are both the same, and honor and dishonor as well,
who remains detached from joy and sorrow, realizes the true essence in the world. ||1||
Renounce both praise and blame; seek instead the state of Nirvaanaa.
O servant Nanak, this is such a difficult game; only a few Gurmukhs understand it! ||2||1||
Gauree, Ninth Mehl:
Holy Saadhus: the Lord fashioned the creation.
One person passes away, and another thinks that he will live forever - this is a wonder beyond understanding! ||1||Pause||
The mortal beings are held in the power of sexual desire, anger and emotional attachment; they have forgotten the Lord, the Immortal Form.
The body is false, but they believe it to be true; it is like a dream in the night. ||1||
Whatever is seen, shall all pass away, like the shadow of a cloud.
O servant Nanak, one who knows the world to be unreal, dwells in the Sanctuary of the Lord. ||2||2||
Gauree, Ninth Mehl:
The Praise of the Lord does not come to dwell in the minds of the mortal beings.
Day and night, they remain engrossed in Maya. Tell me, how can they sing God's Glories? ||1||Pause||
In this way, they bind themselves to children, friends, Maya and possessiveness.
Like the deer's delusion, this world is false; and yet, beholding it, they chase after it. ||1||
Our Lord and Master is the source of pleasures and liberation; and yet, the fool forgets Him.
O servant Nanak, among millions, there is scarcely anyone who attains the Lord's meditation. ||2||3||
Gauree, Ninth Mehl:
Holy Saadhus: this mind cannot be restrained.
Fickle desires dwell with it, and so it cannot remain steady. ||1||Pause||
The heart is filled with anger and violence, which cause all sense to be forgotten.
The jewel of spiritual wisdom has been taken away from everyone; nothing can withstand it. ||1||
The Yogis have tried everything and failed; the virtuous have grown weary of singing God's Glories.
O servant Nanak, when the Lord becomes merciful, then every effort is successful. ||2||4||
Gauree, Ninth Mehl:
Holy Saadhus: sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe.
You have obtained the priceless jewel of this human life; why are you uselessly wasting it? ||1||Pause||
He is the Purifier of sinners, the Friend of the poor. Come, and enter the Lord's Sanctuary.
Remembering Him, the elephant's fear was removed; so why do you forget Him? ||1||
Renounce your egotistical pride and your emotional attachment to Maya; focus your consciousness on the Lord's meditation.
Says Nanak, this is the path to liberation. Become Gurmukh, and attain it. ||2||5||
Gauree, Ninth Mehl:
O mother, if only someone would instruct my wayward mind.
