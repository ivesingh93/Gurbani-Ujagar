In the imperishable realm of the Formless Lord, I play the flute of the unstruck sound current. ||1||
Becoming detached, I sing the Lord's Praises.
Imbued with the unattached, unstruck Word of the Shabad, I shall go to the home of the Lord, who has no ancestors. ||1||Pause||
Then, I shall no longer control the breath through the energy channels of the Ida, Pingala and Shushmanaa.
I look upon both the moon and the sun as the same, and I shall merge in the Light of God. ||2||
I do not go to see sacred shrines of pilgrimage, or bathe in their waters; I do not bother any beings or creatures.
The Guru has shown me the sixty-eight places of pilgrimage within my own heart, where I now take my cleansing bath. ||3||
I do not pay attention to anyone praising me, or calling me good and nice.
Says Naam Dayv, my consciousness is imbued with the Lord; I am absorbed in the profound state of Samaadhi. ||4||2||
When there was no mother and no father, no karma and no human body,
when I was not and you were not, then who came from where? ||1||
O Lord, no one belongs to anyone else.
We are like birds perched on a tree. ||1||Pause||
When there was no moon and no sun, then water and air were blended together.
When there were no Shaastras and no Vedas, then where did karma come from? ||2||
Control of the breath and positioning of the tongue, focusing at the third eye and wearing malas of tulsi beads, are all obtained through Guru's Grace.
Naam Dayv prays, this is the supreme essence of reality; the True Guru has inspired this realization. ||3||3||
Raamkalee, Second House:
Someone may practice austerities at Benares, or die upside-down at a sacred shrine of pilgrimage, or burn his body in fire, or rejuvenate his body to life almost forever;
he may perform the horse-sacrifice ceremony, or give donations of gold covered over, but none of these is equal to the worship of the Lord's Name. ||1||
O hypocrite, renounce and abandon your hypocrisy; do not practice deception.
Constantly, continually, chant the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Someone may go to the Ganges or the Godaavari, or to the Kumbha festival, or bathe at Kaydaar Naat'h, or make donations of thousands of cows at Gomti;
he may make millions of pilgrimages to sacred shrines, or freeze his body in the Himalayas; still, none of these is equal to the worship of the Lord's Name. ||2||
Someone may give away horses and elephants, or women on their beds, or land; he may give such gifts over and over again.
He may purify his soul, and give away in charity his body weight in gold; none of these is equal to the worship of the Lord's Name. ||3||
Do not harbor anger in your mind, or blame the Messenger of Death; instead, realize the immaculate state of Nirvaanaa.
My Sovereign Lord King is Raam Chandra, the Son of the King Dasrat'h; prays Naam Dayv, I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar. ||4||4||
Raamkalee, The Word Of Ravi Daas Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
They read and reflect upon all the Names of God; they listen, but they do not see the Lord, the embodiment of love and intuition.
How can iron be transformed into gold, unless it touches the Philosopher's Stone? ||1||
