Meeting with God, the Ocean of Peace, O Nanak, this soul becomes happy. ||1||
Chhant:
One finds God, the Ocean of Peace, when destiny is activated.
Abandoning the distinctions of honor and dishonor, grasp the Feet of the Lord.
Renounce cleverness and trickery, and forsake your evil-minded intellect.
O Nanak, seek the Sanctuary of the Sovereign Lord, Your King, and your marriage will be permanent and stable. ||1||
Why forsake God, and attach yourself to another? Without the Lord, you cannot even live.
The ignorant fool does not feel any shame; the evil man wanders around deluded.
God is the Purifier of sinners; if he forsakes God, tell me, where he can find a place of rest?
O Nanak, by loving devotional worship of the Merciful Lord, he attains the state of eternal life. ||2||
May that vicious tongue that does not chant the Name of the Great Lord of the World, be burnt.
One who does not serve God, the Lover of His devotees, shall have his body eaten by crows.
Enticed by doubt, he does not understand the pain it brings; he wanders through millions of incarnations.
O Nanak, if you desire anything other than the Lord, you shall be consumed, like a maggot in manure. ||3||
Embrace love for the Lord God, and in detachment, unite with Him.
Give up your sandalwood oil, expensive clothes, perfumes, tasty flavors and the poison of egotism.
Do not waver this way or that, but remain wakeful in the service of the Lord.
O Nanak, she who has obtained her God, is a happy soul-bride forever. ||4||1||4||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Seek the Lord, O fortunate ones, and join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe forever, imbued with the Love of the Supreme Lord God.
Serving God forever, you shall obtain the fruitful rewards you desire.
O Nanak, seek the Sanctuary of God; meditate on the Lord, and ride the many waves of the mind. ||1||
I shall not forget God, even for an instant; He has blessed me with everything.
By great good fortune, I have met Him; as Gurmukh, I contemplate my Husband Lord.
Holding me by the arm, He has lifted me up and pulled me out of the darkness, and made me His own.
Chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, Nanak lives; his mind and heart are cooled and soothed. ||2||
What virtues of Yours can I speak, O God, O Searcher of hearts?
Meditating, meditating in remembrance on the Lord, I have crossed over to the other shore.
Singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe, all my desires are fulfilled.
Nanak is saved, meditating on the Lord, the Lord and Master of all. ||3||
Sublime are those eyes, which are drenched with the Love of the Lord.
Gazing upon God, my desires are fulfilled; I have met the Lord, the Friend of my soul.
I have obtained the Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord's Love, and now the taste of corruption is insipid and tasteless to me.
O Nanak, as water mingles with water, my light has merged into the Light. ||4||2||5||9||
