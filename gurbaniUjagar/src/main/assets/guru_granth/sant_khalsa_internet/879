How rare are those who contemplate this spiritual wisdom.
Through this, the supreme state of liberation is attained. ||1||Pause||
The night is in the day, and the day is in the night. The same is true of hot and cold.
No one else knows His state and extent; without the Guru, this is not understood. ||2||
The female is in the male, and the male is in the female. Understand this, O God-realized being!
The meditation is in the music, and knowledge is in meditation. Become Gurmukh, and speak the Unspoken Speech. ||3||
The Light is in the mind, and the mind is in the Light. The Guru brings the five senses together, like brothers.
Nanak is forever a sacrifice to those who enshrine love for the One Word of the Shabad. ||4||9||
Raamkalee, First Mehl:
When the Lord God showered His Mercy,
egotism was eradicated from within me.
That humble servant is very dear to the Lord,
who contemplates the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||1||
That humble servant of the Lord is pleasing to his Lord God;
day and night, he performs devotional worship, day and night. Disregarding his own honor, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
The unstruck melody of the sound current resonates and resounds;
my mind is appeased by the subtle essence of the Lord.
Through the Perfect Guru, I am absorbed in Truth.
Through the Guru, I have found the Lord, the Primal Being. ||2||
Gurbani is the sound current of the Naad, the Vedas, everything.
My mind is attuned to the Lord of the Universe.
He is my sacred shrine of pilgrimage, fasting and austere self-discipline.
The Lord saves, and carries across, those who meet with the Guru. ||3||
One whose self-conceit is gone, sees his fears run away.
That servant grasps the Guru's feet.
The Guru, the True Guru, has expelled my doubts.
Says Nanak, I have merged into the Word of the Shabad. ||4||10||
Raamkalee, First Mehl:
He runs around, begging for clothes and food.
He burns with hunger and corruption, and will suffer in the world hereafter.
He does not follow the Guru's Teachings; through his evil-mindedness, he loses his honor.
Only through the Guru's Teachings will such a person become devoted. ||1||
The way of the Yogi is to dwell in the celestial home of bliss.
He looks impartially, equally upon all. He receives the charity of the Lord's Love, and the Word of the Shabad, and so he is satisfied. ||1||Pause||
The five bulls, the senses, pull the wagon of the body around.
By the Lord's power, one's honor is preserved.
But when the axle breaks, the wagon falls and crashes.
It falls apart, like a pile of logs. ||2||
Contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad, Yogi.
Look upon pain and pleasure as one and the same, sorrow and separation.
Let your food be contemplative meditation upon the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Your wall shall be permanent, by meditating on the Formless Lord. ||3||
Wear the loin-cloth of poise, and be free of entanglements.
The Guru's Word shall release you from sexual desire and anger.
In your mind, let your ear-rings be the Sanctuary of the Guru, the Lord.
O Nanak, worshipping the Lord in deep devotion, the humble are carried across. ||4||11||
