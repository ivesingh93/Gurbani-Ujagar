The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is soothing and cool; remembering it in meditation, the inner fire is quenched. ||3||
Peace, poise, and immense bliss, O Nanak, are obtained, when one becomes the dust of the feet of the humble servants of the Lord.
All of one's affairs are perfectly resolved, meeting with the Perfect Guru. ||4||10||112||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The Lord of the Universe is the treasure of excellence; He is known only to the Gurmukh.
When He shows His Mercy and Kindness, we revel in the Lord's Love. ||1||
Come, O Saints - let us join together and speak the Sermon of the Lord.
Night and day, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and ignore the criticism of others. ||1||Pause||
I live by chanting and meditating on the Naam, and so I obtain immense bliss.
Attachment to the world is useless and vain; it is false, and perishes in the end. ||2||
How rare are those who embrace love for the Lord's Lotus Feet.
Blessed and beautiful is that mouth, which meditates on the Lord. ||3||
The pains of birth, death and reincarnation are erased by meditating on the Lord.
That alone is Nanak's joy, which is pleasing to God. ||4||11||113||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Come, O friends: let us meet together and enjoy all the tastes and flavors.
Let us join together and chant the Ambrosial Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and so wipe away our sins. ||1||
Reflect upon the essence of reality, O Saintly beings, and no troubles shall afflict you.
All of the thieves shall be destroyed, as the Gurmukhs remain wakeful. ||1||Pause||
Take wisdom and humility as your supplies, and burn away the poison of pride.
True is that shop, and perfect the transaction; deal only in the merchandise of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||
They alone are accepted and approved, who dedicate their souls, bodies and wealth.
Those who are pleasing to their God, celebrate in happiness. ||3||
Those fools, who drink in the wine of evil-mindedness, become the husbands of prostitutes.
But those who are imbued with the sublime essence of the Lord, O Nanak, are intoxicated with the Truth. ||4||12||114||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
I made the effort; I did it, and made a beginning.
I live by chanting and meditating on the Naam. The Guru has implanted this Mantra within me. ||1||
I fall at the Feet of the True Guru, who has dispelled my doubts.
Bestowing His Mercy, God has dressed me, and decorated me with the Truth. ||1||Pause||
Taking me by the hand, He made me His own, through the True Order of His Command.
That gift which God gave to me, is perfect greatness. ||2||
Forever and ever, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and chant the Name of the Destroyer of ego.
My vows have been honored, by the Grace of God and the True Guru, who has showered His Mercy. ||3||
The Perfect Guru has given the wealth of the Naam, and the profit of singing the Lord's Glorious Praises.
The Saints are the traders, O Nanak, and the Infinite Lord God is their Banker. ||4||13||115||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
One who has You as His Master, O God, is blessed with great destiny.
He is happy, and forever at peace; his doubts and fears are all dispelled. ||1||
I am the slave of the Lord of the Universe; my Master is the greatest of all.
He is the Creator, the Cause of causes; He is my True Guru. ||1||Pause||
There is no other whom I should fear.
