Prabhaatee, First Mehl, Dakhnee:
Ahalyaa was the wife of Gautam the seer. Seeing her, Indra was enticed.
When he received a thousand marks of disgrace on his body, then he felt regret in his mind. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, no one knowingly makes mistakes.
He alone is mistaken, whom the Lord Himself makes so. He alone understands, whom the Lord causes to understand. ||1||Pause||
Harichand, the king and ruler of his land, did not appreciate the value of his pre-ordained destiny.
If he had known that it was a mistake, he would not have made such a show of giving in charity, and he would not have been sold in the market. ||2||
The Lord took the form of a dwarf, and asked for some land.
If Bal the king has recognized Him, he would not have been deceived, and sent to the underworld. ||3||
Vyaas taught and warned the king Janmayjaa not to do three things.
But he performed the sacred feast and killed eighteen Brahmins; the record of one's past deeds cannot be erased. ||4||
I do not try to calculate the account; I accept the Hukam of God's Command. I speak with intuitive love and respect.
No matter what happens, I will praise the Lord. It is all Your Glorious Greatness, O Lord. ||5||
The Gurmukh remains detached; filth never attaches itself to him. He remains forever in God's Sanctuary.
The foolish self-willed manmukh does not think of the future; he is overtaken by pain, and then he regrets. ||6||
The Creator who created this creation acts, and causes all to act.
O Lord, egotistical pride does not depart from the soul. Falling into egotistical pride, one is ruined. ||7||
Everyone makes mistakes; only the Creator does not make mistakes.
O Nanak, salvation comes through the True Name. By Guru's Grace, one is released. ||8||4||
Prabhaatee, First Mehl:
To chant and listen to the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is my Support.
Worthless entanglements are ended and gone.
The self-willed manmukh, caught in duality, loses his honor.
Except for the Name, I have no other at all. ||1||
Listen, O blind, foolish, idiotic mind.
Aren't you ashamed of your comings and goings in reincarnation? Without the Guru, you shall drown, over and over again. ||1||Pause||
This mind is ruined by its attachment to Maya.
The Command of the Primal Lord is pre-ordained. Before whom should I cry?
Only a few, as Gurmukh, understand this.
Without the Naam, no one is liberated. ||2||
People wander lost, staggering and stumbling through 8.4 million incarnations.
Without knowing the Guru, they cannot escape the noose of Death.
This mind, from one moment to the next, goes from the heavens to the underworld.
The Gurmukh contemplates the Naam, and is released. ||3||
When God sends His Summons, there is no time to delay.
When one dies in the Word of the Shabad, he lives in peace.
Without the Guru, no one understands.
The Lord Himself acts, and inspires all to act. ||4||
Inner conflict comes to an end, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
Through the Perfect True Guru, one is intuitively absorbed into the Lord.
This wobbling, unsteady mind is stabilized,
and one lives the lifestyle of true actions. ||5||
If someone is false within his own self, then how can he be pure?
How rare are those who wash with the Shabad.
How rare are those who, as Gurmukh, live the Truth.
Their comings and goings in reincarnation are over and done. ||6||
