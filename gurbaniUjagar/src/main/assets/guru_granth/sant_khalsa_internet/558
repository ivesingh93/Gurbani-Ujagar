You don't have the bracelets of gold, nor the good crystal jewelry; you haven't dealt with the true jeweler.
Those arms, which do not embrace the neck of the Husband Lord, burn in anguish.
All my companions have gone to enjoy their Husband Lord; which door should I, the wretched one, go to?
O friend, I may look very attractive, but I am not pleasing to my Husband Lord at all.
I have woven my hair into lovely braids, and saturated their partings with vermillion;
but when I go before Him, I am not accepted, and I die, suffering in anguish.
I weep; the whole world weeps; even the birds of the forest weep with me.
The only thing which doesn't weep is my body's sense of separateness, which has separated me from my Lord.
In a dream, He came, and went away again; I cried so many tears.
I can't come to You, O my Beloved, and I can't send anyone to You.
Come to me, O blessed sleep - perhaps I will see my Husband Lord again.
One who brings me a message from my Lord and Master - says Nanak, what shall I give to Him?
Cutting off my head, I give it to Him to sit upon; without my head, I shall still serve Him.
Why haven't I died? Why hasn't my life just ended? My Husband Lord has become a stranger to me. ||1||3||
Wadahans, Third Mehl, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
When the mind is filthy, everything is filthy; by washing the body, the mind is not cleaned.
This world is deluded by doubt; how rare are those who understand this. ||1||
O my mind, chant the One Name.
The True Guru has given me this treasure. ||1||Pause||
Even if one learns the Yogic postures of the Siddhas, and holds his sexual energy in check,
still, the filth of the mind is not removed, and the filth of egotism is not eliminated. ||2||
This mind is not controlled by any other discipline, except the Sanctuary of the True Guru.
Meeting the True Guru, one is transformed beyond description. ||3||
Prays Nanak, one who dies upon meeting the True Guru, shall be rejuvenated through the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
The filth of his attachment and possessiveness shall depart, and his mind shall become pure. ||4||1||
Wadahans, Third Mehl:
By His Grace, one serves the True Guru; by His Grace, service is performed.
By His grace, this mind is controlled, and by His Grace, it becomes pure. ||1||
O my mind, think of the True Lord.
Think of the One Lord, and you shall obtain peace; you shall never suffer in sorrow again. ||1||Pause||
By His Grace, one dies while yet alive, and by His Grace, the Word of the Shabad is enshrined in the mind.
By His Grace, one understands the Hukam of the Lord's Command, and by His Command, one merges into the Lord. ||2||
That tongue, which does not savor the sublime essence of the Lord - may that tongue be burned off!
It remains attached to other pleasures, and through the love of duality, it suffers in pain. ||3||
The One Lord grants His Grace to all; He Himself makes distinctions.
O Nanak, meeting the True Guru, the fruits are obtained, and one is blessed with the Glorious Greatness of the Naam. ||4||2||
