You Yourself take care of Your beings; You Yourself attach them to the hem of Your robe. ||15||
I have built the boat of true Dharmic faith, to cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||16||
The Lord Master is unlimited and endless; Nanak is a sacrifice, a sacrifice to Him. ||17||
Being of Immortal Manifestation, He is not born; He is self-existent; He is the Light in the darkness of Kali Yuga. ||18||
He is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, the Giver of souls; gazing upon Him, I am satisfied and fulfilled. ||19||
He is the One Universal Creator Lord, immaculate and fearless; He is permeating and pervading all the water and the land. ||20||
He blesses His devotees with the Gift of devotional worship; Nanak longs for the Lord, O my mother. ||21||1||6||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl,
Shalok:
Study the Word of the Shabad, O beloveds. It is your anchoring support in life and in death.
Your face shall be radiant, and you will be at peace forever, O Nanak, meditating in remembrance on the One Lord. ||1||
My mind and body are imbued with my Beloved Lord; I have been blessed with loving devotion to the Lord, O Saints. ||1||
The True Guru has approved my cargo, O Saints.
He has blessed His slave with the profit of the Lord's Name; all my thirst is quenched, O Saints. ||1||Pause||
Searching and searching, I have found the One Lord, the jewel; I cannot express His value, O Saints. ||2||
I focus my meditation on His Lotus Feet; I am absorbed in the True Vision of His Darshan, O Saints. ||3||
Singing, singing His Glorious Praises, I am enraptured; meditating in remembrance on the Lord, I am satisfied and fulfilled, O Saints. ||4||
The Lord, the Supreme Soul, is permeating within all; what comes, and what goes, O Saints? ||5||
At the very beginning of time, and throughout the ages, He is, and He shall always be; He is the Giver of peace to all beings, O Saints. ||6||
He Himself is endless; His end cannot be found. He is totally pervading and permeating everywhere, O Saints. ||7||
Nanak: the Lord is my friend, companion, wealth, youth, son, father and mother, O Saints. ||8||2||7||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
In thought, word and deed, I contemplate the Lord's Name.
The horrible world-ocean is very treacherous; O Nanak, the Gurmukh is carried across. ||1||Pause||
Inwardly, peace, and outwardly, peace; meditating on the Lord, evil tendencies are crushed. ||1||
He has rid me of what was clinging to me; my Dear Lord God has blessed me with His Grace. ||2||
The Saints are saved, in His Sanctuary; the very egotistical people rot away and die. ||3||
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I have obtained this fruit, the Support of the One Name alone. ||4||
No one is strong, and no one is weak; all are manifestations of Your Light, Lord. ||5||
You are the all-powerful, indescribable, unfathomable, all-pervading Lord. ||6||
Who can estimate Your value, O Creator Lord? God has no end or limitation. ||7||
Please bless Nanak with the glorious greatness of the gift of the Naam, and the dust of the feet of Your Saints. ||8||3||8||22||
