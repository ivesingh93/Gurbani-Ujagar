It is so difficult to be like the fakeers - the Holy Saints; it is only achieved by perfect karma. ||111||
The first watch of the night brings flowers, and the later watches of the night bring fruit.
Those who remain awake and aware, receive the gifts from the Lord. ||112||
The gifts are from our Lord and Master; who can force Him to bestow them?
Some are awake, and do not receive them, while He awakens others from sleep to bless them. ||113||
You search for your Husband Lord; you must have some fault in your body.
Those who are known as happy soul-brides, do not look to others. ||114||
Within yourself, make patience the bow, and make patience the bowstring.
Make patience the arrow, the Creator will not let you miss the target. ||115||
Those who are patient abide in patience; in this way, they burn their bodies.
They are close to the Lord, but they do not reveal their secret to anyone. ||116||
Let patience be your purpose in life; implant this within your being.
In this way, you will grow into a great river; you will not break off into a tiny stream. ||117||
Fareed, it is difficult to be a dervish - a Holy Saint; it is easier to love bread when it is buttered.
Only a rare few follow the way of the Saints. ||118||
My body is cooking like an oven; my bones are burning like firewood.
If my feet become tired, I will walk on my head, if I can meet my Beloved. ||119||
Do not heat up your body like an oven, and do not burn your bones like firewood.
What harm have your feet and head done to you? Behold your Beloved within yourself. ||120||
I search for my Friend, but my Friend is already with me.
O Nanak, the Unseen Lord cannot be seen; He is revealed only to the Gurmukh. ||121||
Seeing the swans swimming, the cranes became excited.
The poor cranes were drowned to death, with their heads below the water and their feet sticking out above. ||122||
I knew him as a great swan, so I associated with him.
If I had known that he was a only wretched crane, I would never in my life have crossed paths with him. ||123||
Who is a swan, and who is a crane, if God blesses him with His Glance of Grace?
If it pleases Him, O Nanak, He changes a crow into a swan. ||124||
There is only one bird in the lake, but there are fifty trappers.
This body is caught in the waves of desire. O my True Lord, You are my only hope! ||125||
What is that word, what is that virtue, and what is that magic mantra?
What are those clothes, which I can wear to captivate my Husband Lord? ||126||
Humility is the word, forgiveness is the virtue, and sweet speech is the magic mantra.
Wear these three robes, O sister, and you will captivate your Husband Lord. ||127||
If you are wise, be simple;
if you are powerful, be weak;
and when there is nothing to share, then share with others.
How rare is one who is known as such a devotee. ||128||
Do not utter even a single harsh word; your True Lord and Master abides in all.
Do not break anyone's heart; these are all priceless jewels. ||129||
The minds of all are like precious jewels; to harm them is not good at all.
If you desire your Beloved, then do not break anyone's heart. ||130||
