Raag Dayv-Gandhaaree, Fourth Mehl, First House:
Those who become the humble servants of the Lord and Master, lovingly focus their minds on Him.
Those who chant Your Praises, through the Guru's Teachings, have great good fortune recorded upon their foreheads. ||1||Pause||
The bonds and shackles of Maya are shattered, by lovingly focusing their minds on the Name of the Lord.
My mind is enticed by the Guru, the Enticer; beholding Him, I am wonder-struck. ||1||
I slept through the entire dark night of my life, but through the tiniest bit of the Guru's Grace, I have been awakened.
O Beautiful Lord God, Master of servant Nanak, there is none comparable to You. ||2||1||
Dayv-Gandhaaree:
Tell me - on what path will I find my Beauteous Lord?
O Saints of the Lord, show me the Way, and I shall follow. ||1||Pause||
I cherish in my heart the Words of my Beloved; this is the best way.
The bride may be hunch-backed and short, but if she is loved by her Lord Master, she becomes beautiful, and she melts in the Lord's embrace. ||1||
There is only the One Beloved - we are all soul-brides of our Husband Lord. She who is pleasing to her Husband Lord is good.
What can poor, helpless Nanak do? As it pleases the Lord, so does he walk. ||2||2||
Dayv-Gandhaaree:
O my mind, chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har.
The Gurmukh is imbued with the deep red color of the poppy. His shawl is saturated with the Lord's Love. ||1||Pause||
I wander around here and there, like a madman, bewildered, seeking out my Darling Lord.
I shall be the slave of the slave of whoever unites me with my Darling Beloved. ||1||
So align yourself with the Almighty True Guru; drink in and savor the Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord.
By Guru's Grace, servant Nanak has obtained the wealth of the Lord within. ||2||3||
Dayv-Gandhaaree:
Now, I have come, exhausted, to my Lord and Master.
Now that I have come seeking Your Sanctuary, God, please, either save me, or kill me. ||1||Pause||
