Goojaree, Padas Of Naam Dayv Jee, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
If You gave me an empire, then what glory would be in it for me?
If You made me beg for charity, what would it take away from me? ||1||
Meditate and vibrate upon the Lord, O my mind, and you shall obtain the state of Nirvaanaa.
You shall not have to come and go in reincarnation any longer. ||1||Pause||
You created all, and You lead them astray in doubt.
They alone understand, unto whom You give understanding. ||2||
Meeting the True Guru, doubt is dispelled.
Who else should I worship? I can see no other. ||3||
One stone is lovingly decorated,
while another stone is walked upon.
If one is a god, then the other must also be a god.
Says Naam Dayv, I serve the Lord. ||4||1||
Goojaree, First House:
He does not have even a trace of impurity - He is beyond impurity. He is fragrantly scented - He has come to take His Seat in my mind.
No one saw Him come - who can know Him, O Siblings of Destiny? ||1||
Who can describe Him? Who can understand Him? The all-pervading Lord has no ancestors, O Siblings of Destiny. ||1||Pause||
As the path of a bird's flight across the sky cannot be seen,
and the path of a fish through the water cannot be seen;||2||
As the mirage leads one to mistake the sky for a pitcher filled with water -
so is God, the Lord and Master of Naam Dayv, who fits these three comparisons. ||3||2||
Goojaree, Padas Of Ravi Daas Jee, Third House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The calf has contaminated the milk in the teats.
The bumble bee has contaminated the flower, and the fish the water. ||1||
O mother, where shall I find any offering for the Lord's worship?
I cannot find any other flowers worthy of the incomparable Lord. ||1||Pause||
The snakes encircle the sandalwood trees.
Poison and nectar dwell there together. ||2||
Even with incense, lamps, offerings of food and fragrant flowers,
how are Your slaves to worship You? ||3||
I dedicate and offer my body and mind to You.
By Guru's Grace, I attain the immaculate Lord. ||4||
I cannot worship You, nor offer You flowers.
Says Ravi Daas, what shall my condition be hereafter? ||5||1||
Goojaree, Padas Of Trilochan Jee, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
You have not cleansed the filth from within yourself, although outwardly, you wear the dress of a renunciate.
In the heart-lotus of your self, you have not recognized God - why have you become a Sannyaasee? ||1||
