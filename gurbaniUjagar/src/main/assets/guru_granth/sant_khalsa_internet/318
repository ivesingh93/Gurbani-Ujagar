Gauree Kee Vaar, Fifth Mehl: Sung To The Tune Of Vaar Of Raa-I Kamaaldee-Mojadee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
Auspicious and approved is the birth of that humble being who chants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
I am a sacrifice to that humble being who vibrates and meditates on God, the Lord of Nirvaanaa.
The pains of birth and death are eradicated, upon meeting the All-knowing Lord, the Primal Being.
In the Society of the Saints, he crosses over the world-ocean; O servant Nanak, he has the strength and support of the True Lord. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
I rise up in the early morning hours, and the Holy Guest comes into my home.
I wash His feet; He is always pleasing to my mind and body.
I hear the Naam, and I gather in the Naam; I am lovingly attuned to the Naam.
My home and wealth are totally sanctified as I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
The Trader in the Lord's Name, O Nanak, is found by great good fortune. ||2||
Pauree:
Whatever pleases You is good; True is the Pleasure of Your Will.
You are the One, pervading in all; You are contained in all.
You are diffused throughout and permeating all places and interspaces; You are known to be deep within the hearts of all beings.
Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and submitting to His Will, the True Lord is found.
Nanak takes to the Sanctuary of God; he is forever and ever a sacrifice to Him. ||1||
Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
If you are conscious, then be conscious of the True Lord, Your Lord and Master.
O Nanak, come aboard upon the boat of the service of the True Guru, and cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
He wears his body, like clothes of wind - what a proud fool he is!
O Nanak, they will not go with him in the end; they shall be burnt to ashes. ||2||
Pauree:
They alone are delivered from the world, who are preserved and protected by the True Lord.
I live by beholding the faces of those who taste the Ambrosial Essence of the Lord.
Sexual desire, anger, greed and emotional attachment are burnt away, in the Company of the Holy.
God grants His Grace, and the Lord Himself tests them.
O Nanak, His play is not known; no one can understand it. ||2||
Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
O Nanak, that day is beautiful, when God comes to mind.
Cursed is that day, no matter how pleasant the season, when the Supreme Lord God is forgotten. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
O Nanak, become friends with the One, who holds everything in His hands.
They are accounted as false friends, who do not go with you, for even one step. ||2||
Pauree:
The treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is Ambrosial Nectar; meet together and drink it in, O Siblings of Destiny.
Remembering Him in meditation, peace is found, and all thirst is quenched.
So serve the Supreme Lord God and the Guru, and you shall never be hungry again.
All your desires shall be fulfilled, and you shall obtain the status of immortality.
You alone are as great as Yourself, O Supreme Lord God; Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary. ||3||
Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
I have seen all places; there is no place without Him.
O Nanak, those who meet with the True Guru find the object of life. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
