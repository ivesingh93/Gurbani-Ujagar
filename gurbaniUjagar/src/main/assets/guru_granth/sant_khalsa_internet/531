Dayv-Gandhaaree, Fifth Mehl:
O mother, one who sings the Glories of God,
and enshrines love for the Supreme Lord God; his birth is very fruitful. ||1||Pause||
Beautiful, wise, brave and divine is one who obtains the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
He chants the Naam, the Name of the Lord, with his tongue, and does not have to wander in reincarnation again. ||1||
The Perfect Lord God pervades his mind and body; he does not look upon any other.
Hell and disease do not afflict one who joins the Company of the Lord's humble servants, O Nanak; the Lord attaches him to the hem of His robe. ||2||14||
Dayv-Gandhaaree, Fifth Mehl:
His fickle mind is entangled in a dream.
He does not even understand this much, that someday he shall have to depart; he has gone crazy with Maya. ||1||Pause||
He is engrossed in the delight of the flower's color; he strives only to indulge in corruption.
Hearing about greed, he feels happy in his mind, and he runs after it. ||1||
Wandering and roaming all around, I have endured great pain, but now, I have come to the door of the Saint.
Granting His Grace, the Supreme Lord Master has blended Nanak with Himself. ||2||15||
Dayv-Gandhaaree, Fifth Mehl:
All peace is found in the Guru's feet.
They drive away my sins and purify my mind; their Support carries me across. ||1||Pause||
This is the labor which I perform: worship, flower-offerings, service and devotion.
My mind blossoms forth and is enlightened, and I am not cast into the womb again. ||1||
I behold the fruitful vision of the Saint; this is the meditation I have taken.
The Lord Master has become Merciful to Nanak, and he has entered the Sanctuary of the Holy. ||2||16||
Dayv-Gandhaaree, Fifth Mehl:
Offer your prayer to your Lord.
You shall obtain the four blessings, and the treasures of bliss, pleasure, peace, poise and the spiritual powers of the Siddhas. ||1||Pause||
Renounce your self-conceit, and grasp hold of the Guru's feet; hold tight to the hem of God's robe.
The heat of the ocean of fire does not affect one who longs for the Lord and Master's Sanctuary. ||1||
Again and again, God puts up with the millions of sins of the supremely ungrateful ones.
The embodiment of mercy, the Perfect Transcendent Lord - Nanak longs for His Sanctuary. ||2||17||
Dayv-Gandhaaree, Fifth Mehl:
Place the Guru's feet within your heart,
and all illness, sorrow and pain shall be dispelled; all suffering shall come to an end. ||1||Pause||
The sins of countless incarnations are erased, as if one has taken purifying baths at millions of sacred shrines.
The treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is obtained by singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe, and centering one's mind in meditation on Him. ||1||
Showing His Mercy, the Lord has made me His slave; breaking my bonds, He has saved me.
I live by chanting and meditating on the Naam, and the Bani of Your Word; slave Nanak is a sacrifice to You. ||2||18|| Chhakaa 1.||
Dayv-Gandhaaree, Fifth Mehl:
O mother, I long to see the Feet of God.
