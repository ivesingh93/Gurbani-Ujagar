In doubt and emotional attachment, this person understands nothing; with this leash, these feet are tied up. ||2||
What did this person do, when he did not exist?
When the Immaculate and Formless Lord God was all alone, He did everything by Himself. ||3||
He alone knows His actions; He created this creation.
Says Nanak, the Lord Himself is the Doer. The True Guru has dispelled my doubts. ||4||5||163||
Gauree Maalaa, Fifth Mehl:
Without the Lord, other actions are useless.
Meditative chants, intense deep meditation, austere self-discipline and rituals - these are plundered in this world. ||1||Pause||
Fasting, daily rituals, and austere self-discipline - those who keep the practice of these, are rewarded with less than a shell.
Hereafter, the way is different, O Siblings of Destiny. There, these things are of no use at all. ||1||
Those who bathe at sacred shrines of pilgrimage, and wander over the earth, find no place of rest hereafter.
There, these are of no use at all. By these things, they only please other people. ||2||
Reciting the four Vedas from memory, they do not obtain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence hereafter.
Those who do not understand the One Pure Word, utter total nonsense. ||3||
Nanak voices this opinion: those who practice it, swim across.
Serve the Guru, and meditate on the Naam; renounce the egotistical pride from your mind. ||4||6||164||
Gauree Maalaa, Fifth Mehl:
O Lord, I chant Your Name, Har, Har, Har.
I cannot do anything by myself, O Lord and Master. As You keep me, so I remain. ||1||Pause||
What can the mere mortal do? What is in the hands of this poor creature?
As You attach us, so we are attached, O my Perfect Lord and Master. ||1||
Take pity on me, O Great Giver of all, that I may enshrine love for Your Form alone.
Nanak offers this prayer to the Lord, that he may chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||7||165||
Raag Gauree Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O Merciful to the meek, O Dear Lord King,
You have engaged millions of people in Your Service.
You are the Lover of Your devotees; this is Your Nature.
You are totally pervading all places. ||1||
How can I behold my Beloved? What is that way of life?
Become the slave of the Saints, and serve at their feet.
I dedicate this soul; I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to them.
Bowing low, I fall at the Feet of the Lord. ||2||
The Pandits, the religious scholars, study the books of the Vedas.
Some become renunciates, and bathe at sacred shrines of pilgrimage.
Some sing tunes and melodies and songs.
But I meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Fearless Lord. ||3||
My Lord and Master has become merciful to me.
I was a sinner, and I have been sanctified, taking to the Guru's Feet.
