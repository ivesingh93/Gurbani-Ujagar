Through the Perfect Guru, it is obtained.
Those who are imbued with the Naam find everlasting peace.
But without the Naam, mortals burn in egotism. ||3||
By great good fortune, some contemplate the Lord's Name.
Through the Lord's Name, all sorrows are eradicated.
He dwells within the heart, and pervades the external universe as well.
O Nanak, the Creator Lord knows all. ||4||12||
Basant, Third Mehl, Ik-Tukas:
I am just a worm, created by You, O Lord.
If you bless me, then I chant Your Primal Mantra. ||1||
I chant and reflect on His Glorious Virtues, O my mother.
Meditating on the Lord, I fall at the Lord's Feet. ||1||Pause||
By Guru's Grace, I am addicted to the favor of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Why waste your life in hatred, vengeance and conflict? ||2||
When the Guru granted His Grace, my egotism was eradicated,
and then, I obtained the Lord's Name with intuitive ease. ||3||
The most lofty and exalted occupation is to contemplate the Word of the Shabad.
Nanak chants the True Name. ||4||1||13||
Basant, Third Mehl:
The season of spring has come, and all the plants have blossomed forth.
This mind blossoms forth, in association with the True Guru. ||1||
So meditate on the True Lord, O my foolish mind.
Only then shall you find peace, O my mind. ||1||Pause||
This mind blossoms forth, and I am in ecstasy.
I am blessed with the Ambrosial Fruit of the Naam, the Name of the Lord of the Universe. ||2||
Everyone speaks and says that the Lord is the One and Only.
By understanding the Hukam of His Command, we come to know the One Lord. ||3||
Says Nanak, no one can describe the Lord by speaking through ego.
All speech and insight comes from our Lord and Master. ||4||2||14||
Basant, Third Mehl:
All the ages were created by You, O Lord.
Meeting with the True Guru, one's intellect is awakened. ||1||
O Dear Lord, please blend me with Yourself;
let me merge in the True Name, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||1||Pause||
When the mind is in spring, all people are rejuvenated.
Blossoming forth and flowering through the Lord's Name, peace is obtained. ||2||
Contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad, one is in spring forever,
with the Lord's Name enshrined in the heart. ||3||
When the mind is in spring, the body and mind are rejuvenated.
O Nanak, this body is the tree which bears the fruit of the Lord's Name. ||4||3||15||
Basant, Third Mehl:
They alone are in the spring season, who sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
They come to worship the Lord with devotion, through their perfect destiny. ||1||
This mind is not even touched by spring.
This mind is burnt by duality and double-mindedness. ||1||Pause||
This mind is entangled in worldly affairs, creating more and more karma.
Enchanted by Maya, it cries out in suffering forever. ||2||
This mind is released, only when it meets with the True Guru.
Then, it does not suffer beatings by the Messenger of Death. ||3||
This mind is released, when the Guru emancipates it.
O Nanak, attachment to Maya is burnt away through the Word of the Shabad. ||4||4||16||
Basant, Third Mehl:
Spring has come, and all the plants are flowering.
These beings and creatures blossom forth when they focus their consciousness on the Lord. ||1||
