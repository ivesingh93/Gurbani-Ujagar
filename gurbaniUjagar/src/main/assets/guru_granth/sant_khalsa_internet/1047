He does whatever He pleases.
No one has done, or can do anything by himself.
O Nanak, through the Name, one is blessed with glorious greatness, and obtains honor in the Court of the True Lord. ||16||3||
Maaroo, Third Mehl:
All who come shall have to depart.
In the love of duality, they are caught by the noose of the Messenger of Death.
Those humble beings who are protected by the True Guru, are saved. They merge into the Truest of the True. ||1||
The Creator Himself creates the creation, and watches over it.
They alone are acceptable, upon whom He bestows His Glance of Grace.
The Gurmukh attains spiritual wisdom, and understands everything. The ignorant ones act blindly. ||2||
The self-willed manmukh is cynical; he doesn't understand.
He dies and dies again, only to be reborn, and loses his life uselessly again.
The Gurmukh is imbued with the Naam, the Name of the Lord; he find peace, and is intuitively immersed in the True Lord. ||3||
Chasing after worldly affairs, the mind has become corroded and rusty.
But meeting with the Perfect Guru, it is transmuted into gold once again.
When the Lord Himself grants forgiveness, then peace is obtained; through the Perfect Word of the Shabad, one is united with Him. ||4||
The false and evil-minded are the most wicked of the wicked.
They are the most unworthy of the unworthy.
With false intellect, and insipid words of mouth, evil-minded, they do not obtain the Naam. ||5||
The unworthy soul-bride is not pleasing to her Husband Lord.
False-minded, her actions are false.
The foolish person does not know the excellence of her Husband Lord. Without the Guru, she does not understand at all. ||6||
The evil-minded, wicked soul-bride practices wickedness.
She decorates herself, but her Husband Lord is not pleased.
The virtuous soul-bride enjoys and ravishes her Husband Lord forever; the True Guru unites her in His Union. ||7||
God Himself issues the Hukam of His Command, and beholds all.
Some are forgiven, according to their pre-ordained destiny.
Night and day, they are imbued with the Naam, and they find the True Lord. He Himself unites them in His Union. ||8||
Egotism attaches them to the juice of emotional attachment, and makes them run around.
The Gurmukh is intuitively immersed in the True Love of the Lord.
He Himself unites, He Himself acts, and beholds. Without the True Guru, understanding is not obtained. ||9||
Some contemplate the Word of the Shabad; these humble beings remain always awake and aware.
Some are attached to the love of Maya; these unfortunate ones remain asleep.
He Himself acts, and inspires all to act; no one else can do anything. ||10||
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, death is conquered and killed.
Keep the Name of the Lord enshrined within your heart.
Serving the True Guru, peace is obtained, and one merges in the Name of the Lord. ||11||
In the love of duality, the world wanders around insane.
Immersed in love and attachment to Maya, it suffers in pain.
Wearing all sorts of religious robes, He is not obtained. Without the True Guru, peace is not found. ||12||
Who is to blame, when He Himself does everything?
As He wills, so is the path we take.
He Himself is the Merciful Giver of peace; as He wills, so do we follow. ||13||
He Himself is the Creator, and He Himself is the Enjoyer.
He Himself is detached, and He Himself is attached.
He Himself is immaculate, compassionate, the lover of nectar; the Hukam of His Command cannot be erased. ||14||
Those who know the One Lord are very fortunate.
