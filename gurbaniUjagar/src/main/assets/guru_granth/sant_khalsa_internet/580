They alone are acclaimed as brave warriors in the world hereafter, who receive true honor in the Court of the Lord.
They are honored in the Court of the Lord; they depart with honor, and they do not suffer pain in the world hereafter.
They meditate on the One Lord, and obtain the fruits of their rewards. Serving the Lord, their fear is dispelled.
Do not indulge in egotism, and dwell within your own mind; the Knower Himself knows everything.
The death of brave heroes is blessed, if it is approved by God. ||3||
Nanak: for whom should we mourn, O Baba? This world is merely a play.
The Lord Master beholds His work, and contemplates His creative potency.
He contemplates His creative potency, having established the Universe. He who created it, He alone knows.
He Himself beholds it, and He Himself understands it. He Himself realizes the Hukam of His Command.
He who created these things, He alone knows. His subtle form is infinite.
Nanak: for whom should we mourn, O Baba? This world is merely a play. ||4||2||
Wadahans, First Mehl, Dakhanee:
The True Creator Lord is True - know this well; He is the True Sustainer.
He Himself fashioned His Own Self; the True Lord is invisible and infinite.
He brought together, and then separated, the two grinding stones of the earth and the sky; without the Guru, there is only pitch darkness.
He created the sun and the moon; night and day, they move according to His Thought. ||1||
O True Lord and Master, You are True. O True Lord, bless me with Your Love. ||Pause||
You created the Universe; You are the Giver of pain and pleasure.
You created woman and man, the love of poison, and emotional attachment to Maya.
The four sources of creation, and the power of the Word, are also of Your making. You give Support to all beings.
You have made the Creation as Your Throne; You are the True Judge. ||2||
You created comings and goings, but You are ever-stable, O Creator Lord.
In birth and death, in coming and going, this soul is held in bondage by corruption.
The evil person has forgotten the Naam; he has drowned - what can he do now?
Forsaking merit, he has loaded the poisonous cargo of demerits; he is a trader of sins. ||3||
The beloved soul has received the Call, the Command of the True Creator Lord.
The soul, the husband, has become separated from the body, the bride. The Lord is the Re-uniter of the separated ones.
No one cares for your beauty, O beautiful bride.; the Messenger of Death is bound only by the Lord Commander's Command.
He does not distinguish between young children and old people; he tears apart love and affection. ||4||
The nine doors are closed by the True Lord's Command, and the swan-soul takes flight into the skies.
The body-bride is separated, and defrauded by falsehood; she is now a widow - her husband's body lies dead in the courtyard.
The widow cries out at the door, "The light of my mind has gone out, O my mother, with his death".
So cry out, O soul-brides of the Husband Lord, and dwell on the Glorious Praises of the True Lord. ||5||
Her loved one is cleansed, bathed in water, and dressed in silken robes.
The musicians play, and the Bani of the True Lord's Words are sung; the five relatives feel as if they too are dead, so deadened are their minds.
Separation from my beloved is like death to me!" cries the widow".My life in this world is cursed and worthless!
But she alone is approved, who dies, while yet still alive; she lives for the sake of the Love of her Beloved. ||6||
So cry out in mourning, you who have come to mourn; this world is false and fraudulent.
