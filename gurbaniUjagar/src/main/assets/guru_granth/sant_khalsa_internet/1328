Out of pain, pleasure is produced, and out of pleasure comes pain.
That mouth which praises You - what hunger could that mouth ever suffer? ||3||
O Nanak, you alone are foolish; all the rest of the world is good.
That body in which the Naam does not well up - that body becomes miserable. ||4||2||
Prabhaatee, First Mehl:
For His sake, Brahma uttered the Vedas, and Shiva renounced Maya.
For His sake, the Siddhas became hermits and renunciates; even the gods have not realized His Mystery. ||1||
O Baba, keep the True Lord in your mind, and utter the Name of the True Lord with your mouth; the True Lord will carry you across.
Enemies and pain shall not even approach you; only a rare few realize the Wisdom of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Fire, water and air make up the world; these three are the slaves of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
One who does not chant the Naam is a thief, dwelling in the fortress of the five thieves. ||2||
If someone does a good deed for someone else, he totally puffs himself up in his conscious mind.
The Lord bestows so many virtues and so much goodness; He does not ever regret it. ||3||
Those who praise You gather the wealth in their laps; this is Nanak's wealth.
Whoever shows respect to them is not summoned by the Messenger of Death. ||4||3||
Prabhaatee, First Mehl:
One who has no beauty, no social status, no mouth, no flesh
- meeting with the True Guru, he finds the Immaculate Lord, and dwells in Your Name. ||1||
O detached Yogi, contemplate the essence of reality,
and you shall never again come to be born into the world. ||1||Pause||
One who does not have good karma or Dharmic faith, sacred rosary or mala
- through the Light of God, wisdom is bestowed; the True Guru is our Protector. ||2||
One who does not observe any fasts, make religious vows or chant
- he does not have to worry about good luck or bad, if he obeys the Command of the True Guru. ||3||
One who is not hopeful, nor hopeless, who has trained his intuitive consciousness
- his being blends with the Supreme Being. O Nanak, his awareness is awakened. ||4||4||
Prabhaatee, First Mehl:
What he says is approved in the Court of the Lord.
He looks upon poison and nectar as one and the same. ||1||
What can I say? You are permeating and pervading all.
Whatever happens, is all by Your Will. ||1||Pause||
The Divine Light shines radiantly, and egotistical pride is dispelled.
The True Guru bestows the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||
In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, one's birth is approved,
if one is honored in the True Court. ||3||
Speaking and listening, one goes to the Celestial Home of the Indescribable Lord.
Mere words of mouth, O Nanak, are burnt away. ||4||5||
Prabhaatee, First Mehl:
One who bathes in the Ambrosial Water of spiritual wisdom takes with him the virtues of the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage.
The Guru's Teachings are the gems and jewels; the Sikh who serves Him searches and finds them. ||1||
There is no sacred shrine equal to the Guru.
The Guru encompasses the ocean of contentment. ||1||Pause||
