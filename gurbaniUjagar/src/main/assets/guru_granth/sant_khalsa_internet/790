Shalok, First Mehl:
Thieves, adulterers, prostitutes and pimps,
make friendships with the unrighteous, and eat with the unrighteous.
They do not know the value of the Lord's Praises, and Satan is always with them.
If a donkey is anointed with sandalwood paste, he still loves to roll in the dirt.
O Nanak, by spinning falsehood, a fabric of falsehood is woven.
False is the cloth and its measurement, and false is pride in such a garment. ||1||
First Mehl:
The callers to prayer, the flute-players, the horn-blowers, and also the singers -
some are givers, and some are beggars; they become acceptable only through Your Name, Lord.
O Nanak, I am a sacrifice to those who hear and accept the Name. ||2||
Pauree:
Attachment to Maya is totally false, and false are those who go that way.
Through egotism, the world is caught in conflict and strife, and it dies.
The Gurmukh is free of conflict and strife, and sees the One Lord, pervading everywhere.
Recognizing that the Supreme Soul is everywhere, he crosses over the terrifying world-ocean.
His light merges into the Light, and he is absorbed into the Lord's Name. ||14||
Shalok: First Mehl:
O True Guru, bless me with Your charity; You are the All-powerful Giver.
May I subdue and quiet my egotism, pride, sexual desire, anger and self-conceit.
Burn away all my greed, and give me the Support of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Day and night, keep me ever-fresh and new, spotless and pure; let me never be soiled by sin.
O Nanak, in this way I am saved; by Your Grace, I have found peace. ||1||
First Mehl:
There is only the one Husband Lord, for all who stand at His Door.
O Nanak, they ask for news of their Husband Lord, from those who are imbued with His Love. ||2||
First Mehl:
All are imbued with love for their Husband Lord; I am a discarded bride - what good am I?
My body is filled with so many faults; my Lord and Master does not even turn His thoughts to me. ||3||
First Mehl:
I am a sacrifice to those who praise the Lord with their mouths.
All the nights are for the happy soul-brides; I am a discarded bride - if only I could have even one night with Him! ||4||
Pauree:
I am a beggar at Your Door, begging for charity; O Lord, please grant me Your Mercy, and give to me.
As Gurmukh, unite me, your humble servant, with You, that I may receive Your Name.
Then, the unstruck melody of the Shabad will vibrate and resound, and my light will blend with the Light.
Within my heart, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and celebrate the Word of the Lord's Shabad.
The Lord Himself is pervading and permeating the world; so fall in love with Him! ||15||
Shalok, First Mehl:
Those who do not obtain the sublime essence, the love and delight of their Husband Lord,
are like guests in a deserted house; they leave just as they have come, empty-handed. ||1||
First Mehl:
He receives hundreds and thousands of reprimands, day and night;
the swan-soul has renounced the Lord's Praises, and attached itself to a rotting carcass.
Cursed is that life, in which one only eats to fill his belly.
O Nanak, without the True Name, all one's friends turn to enemies. ||2||
Pauree:
The minstrel continually sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, to embellish his life.
The Gurmukh serves and praises the True Lord, enshrining Him within his heart.
