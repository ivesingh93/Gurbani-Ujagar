Gauree Gwaarayree, Fourth Mehl:
Service to the True Guru is fruitful and rewarding;
meeting Him, I meditate on the Name of the Lord, the Lord Master.
So many are emancipated along with those who meditate on the Lord. ||1||
O GurSikhs, chant the Name of the Lord, O my Siblings of Destiny.
Chanting the Lord's Name, all sins are washed away. ||1||Pause||
When one meets the Guru, then the mind becomes centered.
The five passions, running wild, are brought to rest by meditating on the Lord.
Night and day, within the body-village, the Glorious Praises of the Lord are sung. ||2||
Those who apply the dust of the Feet of the True Guru to their faces,
renounce falsehood and enshrine love for the Lord.
Their faces are radiant in the Court of the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny. ||3||
Service to the Guru is pleasing to the Lord Himself.
Even Krishna and Balbhadar meditated on the Lord, falling at the Guru's Feet.
O Nanak, the Lord Himself saves the Gurmukhs. ||4||5||43||
Gauree Gwaarayree, Fourth Mehl:
The Lord Himself is the Yogi, who wields the staff of authority.
The Lord Himself is deeply absorbed in His primal trance.
The Lord Himself practices tapa - intense self-disciplined meditation. ||1||
Such is my Lord, who is all-pervading everywhere.
He dwells near at hand - the Lord is not far away. ||1||Pause||
The Lord Himself is the Word of the Shabad. He Himself is the awareness, attuned to its music.
The Lord Himself beholds, and He Himself blossoms forth.
The Lord Himself chants, and the Lord Himself inspires others to chant. ||2||
He Himself is the rainbird, and the Ambrosial Nectar raining down.
The Lord is the Ambrosial Nectar; He Himself leads us to drink it in.
The Lord Himself is the Doer; He Himself is our Saving Grace. ||3||
The Lord Himself is the Boat, the Raft and the Boatman.
The Lord Himself, through the Guru's Teachings, saves us.
O Nanak, the Lord Himself carries us across to the other side. ||4||6||44||
Gauree Bairaagan, Fourth Mehl:
O Master, You are my Banker. I receive only that capital which You give me.
I would purchase the Lord's Name with love, if You Yourself, in Your Mercy, would sell it to me. ||1||
I am the merchant, the peddler of the Lord.
I trade in the merchandise and capital of the Lord's Name. ||1||Pause||
I have earned the profit, the wealth of devotional worship of the Lord. I have become pleasing to the Mind of the Lord, the True Banker.
I chant and meditate on the Lord, loading the merchandise of the Lord's Name. The Messenger of Death, the tax collector, does not even approach me. ||2||
Those traders who trade in other merchandise, are caught up in the endless waves of the pain of Maya.
According to the business in which the Lord has placed them, so are the rewards they obtain. ||3||
People trade in the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, when the God shows His Mercy and bestows it.
Servant Nanak serves the Lord, the Banker; he shall never again be called to render his account. ||4||1||7||45||
Gauree Bairaagan, Fourth Mehl:
The mother nourishes the fetus in the womb, hoping for a son,
who will grow and earn and give her money to enjoy herself.
In just the same way, the humble servant of the Lord loves the Lord, who extends His Helping Hand to us. ||1||
