Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
The fire runs away from the fuel.
The water runs away from the dust in all directions.
The feet are above, and the sky is beneath.
The ocean appears in the cup. ||1||
Such is our all-powerful dear Lord.
His devotees do not forget Him, even for an instant. Twenty-four hours a day, O mind, meditate on Him. ||1||Pause||
First comes the butter, and then the milk.
The dirt cleans the soap.
The fearless are afraid of fear.
The living are killed by the dead. ||2||
The visible body is hidden, and the etheric body is seen.
The Lord of the world does all these things.
The one who is cheated, is not cheated by the cheat.
With no merchandise, the trader trades again and again. ||3||
So join the Society of the Saints, and chant the Lord's Name.
So say the Simritees, Shaastras, Vedas and Puraanas.
Rare are those who contemplate and meditate on God.
O Nanak, they attain the supreme status. ||4||43||54||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
Whatever pleases Him happens.
Forever and ever, I seek the Sanctuary of the Lord. There is none other than God. ||1||Pause||
You look upon your children, spouse and wealth; none of these will go along with you.
Eating the poisonous potion, you have gone astray. You will have to go, and leave Maya and your mansions. ||1||
Slandering others, you are totally ruined; because of your past actions, you shall be consigned to the womb of reincarnation.
Your past actions will not just go away; the most horrible Messenger of Death shall seize you. ||2||
You tell lies, and do not practice what you preach. Your desires are not satisfied - what a shame.
You have contracted an incurable disease; slandering the Saints, your body is wasting away; you are utterly ruined. ||3||
He embellishes those whom He has fashioned. He Himself gave life to the Saints.
O Nanak, He hugs His slaves close in His Embrace. Please grant Your Grace, O Supreme Lord God, and be kind to me as well. ||4||44||55||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
Such is the Perfect Divine Guru, my help and support.
Meditation on Him is not wasted. ||1||Pause||
Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, I am enraptured.
The dust of His feet snaps the noose of Death.
His lotus feet dwell within my mind,
and so all the affairs of my body are arranged and resolved. ||1||
One upon whom He places His Hand, is protected.
My God is the Master of the masterless.
He is the Savior of sinners, the treasure of mercy.
Forever and ever, I am a sacrifice to Him. ||2||
One whom He blesses with His Immaculate Mantra,
renounces corruption; his egotistical pride is dispelled.
Meditate on the One Lord in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
Sins are erased, through the love of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||3||
The Guru, the Transcendent Lord, dwells among all.
The treasure of virtue pervades and permeates each and every heart.
Please grant me the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan;
O God, I place my hopes in You. Nanak continually offers this true prayer. ||4||45||56||
