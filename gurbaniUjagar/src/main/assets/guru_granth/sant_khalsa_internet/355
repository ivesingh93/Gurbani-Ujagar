Aasaa, First Mehl:
Let the body be the Brahmin, and let the mind be the loin-cloth;
let spiritual wisdom be the sacred thread, and meditation the ceremonial ring.
I seek the Name of the Lord and His Praise as my cleansing bath.
By Guru's Grace, I am absorbed into God. ||1||
O Pandit, O religious scholar, contemplate God in such a way
that His Name may sanctify you, that His Name may be your study, and His Name your wisdom and way of life. ||1||Pause||
The outer sacred thread is worthwhile only as long as the Divine Light is within.
So make the remembrance of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, your loin-cloth and the ceremonial mark on your forehead.
Here and hereafter, the Name alone shall stand by you.
Do not seek any other actions, except the Name. ||2||
Worship the Lord in loving adoration, and burn your desire for Maya.
Behold only the One Lord, and do not seek out any other.
Become aware of reality, in the Sky of the Tenth Gate;
read aloud the Lord's Word, and contemplate it. ||3||
With the diet of His Love, doubt and fear depart.
With the Lord as your night watchman, no thief will dare to break in.
Let the knowledge of the One God be the ceremonial mark on your forehead.
Let the realization that God is within you be your discrimination. ||4||
Through ritual actions, God cannot be won over;
by reciting sacred scriptures, His value cannot be estimated.
The eighteen Puraanas and the four Vedas do not know His mystery.
O Nanak, the True Guru has shown me the Lord God. ||5||20||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
He alone is the selfless servant, slave and humble devotee,
who as Gurmukh, becomes the slave of his Lord and Master.
He, who created the Universe, shall ultimately destroy it.
Without Him, there is no other at all. ||1||
Who reflects upon the True Name through the Word of the Guru's Shabad,
that Gurmukh is found to be true in the True Court. ||1||Pause||
The true supplication, the true prayer -
within the Mansion of His Sublime Presence, the True Lord Master hears and applauds these.
He summons the truthful to His Heavenly Throne
and bestows glorious greatness upon them; that which He wills, comes to pass. ||2||
The Power is Yours; You are my only Support.
The Word of the Guru's Shabad is my true password.
One who obeys the Hukam of the Lord's Command, goes to Him openly.
With the password of truth, his way is not blocked. ||3||
The Pandit reads and expounds on the Vedas,
but he does not know the secret of the thing within himself.
Without the Guru, understanding and realization are not obtained;
but still God is True, pervading everywhere. ||4||
What should I say, or speak or describe?
Only You Yourself know, O Lord of total wonder.
Nanak takes the Support of the Door of the One God.
There, at the True Door, the Gurmukhs sustain themselves. ||5||21||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
The clay pitcher of the body is miserable; it suffers in pain through birth and death.
How can this terrifying world-ocean be crossed over? Without the Lord - Guru, it cannot be crossed. ||1||
Without You, there is no other at all, O my Beloved; without you, there is no other at all.
You are in all colors and forms; he alone is forgiven, upon whom You bestow Your Glance of Grace. ||1||Pause||
Maya, my mother-in-law, is evil; she does not let me live in my own home. The vicious one does not let me meet with my Husband Lord.
I serve at the feet of my companions and friends; the Lord has showered me with His Mercy, through Guru's Grace. ||2||
Reflecting upon my self, and conquering my mind, I have seen that there is no other friend like You.
