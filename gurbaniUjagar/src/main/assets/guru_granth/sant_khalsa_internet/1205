With my feet, I walk on my Lord and Mater's Path. With my tongue, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||2||
With my eyes, I see the Lord, the Embodiment of Absolute Bliss; the Saint has turned away from the world.
I have found the Priceless Name of the Beloved Lord; it never leaves me or goes anywhere else. ||3||
What praise, what glory and what virtues should I utter, in order to please the Lord?
That humble being, unto whom the Merciful Lord is kind - O servant Nanak, he is the slave of God's slaves. ||4||8||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Who can I tell, and with whom can I speak, about this state of peace and bliss?
I am in ecstasy and delight, gazing upon the Blessed Vision of God's Darshan. My mind sings His Songs of Joy and His Glories. ||1||Pause||
I am wonderstruck, gazing upon the Wondrous Lord. The Merciful Lord is All-pervading everywhere.
I drink in the Invaluable Nectar of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Like the mute, I can only smile - I cannot speak of its flavor. ||1||
As the breath is held in bondage, no one can understand its coming in and going out.
So is that person, whose heart is enlightened by the Lord - his story cannot be told. ||2||
As many other efforts as you can think of - I have seen them and studied them all.
My Beloved, Carefree Lord has revealed Himself within the home of my own heart; thus I have realized the Inaccessible Lord. ||3||
The Absolute, Formless, Eternally Unchanging, Immeasurable Lord cannot be measured.
Says Nanak, whoever endures the unendurable - this state belongs to him alone. ||4||9||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
The corrupt person passes his days and nights uselessly.
He does not vibrate and meditate on the Lord of the Universe; he is intoxicated with egotistical intellect. He loses his life in the gamble. ||1||Pause||
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is priceless, but he is not in love with it. He loves only to slander others.
Weaving the grass, he builds his house of straw. At the door, he builds a fire. ||1||
He carries a load of sulfur on his head, and drives the Ambrosial Nectar out of his mind.
Wearing his good clothes, the mortal falls into the coal-pit; again and again, he tries to shake it off. ||2||
Standing on the branch, eating and eating and smiling, he cuts down the tree.
He falls down head-first and is shattered into bits and pieces. ||3||
He bears vengeance against the Lord who is free of vengeance. The fool is not up to the task.
Says Nanak, the Saving Grace of the Saints is the Formless, Supreme Lord God. ||4||10||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
All the others are deluded by doubt; they do not understand.
That person, within whose heart the One Pure Word abides, realizes the essence of the Vedas. ||1||Pause||
He walks in the ways of the world, trying to please people.
But as long as his heart is not enlightened, he is stuck in pitch black darkness. ||1||
The land may be prepared in every way, but nothing sprouts without being planted.
Just so, without the Lord's Name, no one is liberated, nor is egotistical pride eradicated. ||2||
The mortal may churn water until he is sore, but how can butter be produced?
Without meeting the Guru, no one is liberated, and the Lord of the Universe is not met. ||3||
