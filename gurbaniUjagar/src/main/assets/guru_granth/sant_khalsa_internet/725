He Himself knows, and He Himself acts; He laid out the garden of the world. ||1||
Savor the story, the story of the Beloved Lord, which brings a lasting peace. ||Pause||
She who does not enjoy the Love of her Husband Lord, shall come to regret and repent in the end.
She wrings her hands, and bangs her head, when the night of her life has passed away. ||2||
Nothing comes from repentance, when the game is already finished.
She shall have the opportunity to enjoy her Beloved, only when her turn comes again. ||3||
The happy soul-bride attains her Husband Lord - she is so much better than I am.
I have none of her merits or virtues; whom should I blame? ||4||
I shall go and ask those sisters who have enjoyed their Husband Lord.
I touch their feet, and ask them to show me the Path. ||5||
She who understands the Hukam of His Command, O Nanak, applies the Fear of God as her sandalwood oil;
she charms her Beloved with her virtue, and so obtains Him. ||6||
She who meets her Beloved in her heart, remains united with Him; this is truly called union.
As much as she may long for Him, she shall not meet Him through mere words. ||7||
As metal melts into metal again, so does love melt into love.
By Guru's Grace, this understanding is obtained, and then, one obtains the Fearless Lord. ||8||
There may be an orchard of betel nut trees in the garden, but the donkey does not appreciate its value.
If someone savors a fragrance, then he can truly appreciate its flower. ||9||
One who drinks in the ambrosia, O Nanak, abandons his doubts and wanderings.
Easily and intuitively, he remains blended with the Lord, and obtains the immortal status. ||10||1||
Tilang, Fourth Mehl:
The Guru, my friend, has told me the stories and the sermon of the Lord.
I am a sacrifice to my Guru; to the Guru, I am a sacrifice. ||1||
Come, join with me, O Sikh of the Guru, come and join with me. You are my Guru's Beloved. ||Pause||
The Glorious Praises of the Lord are pleasing to the Lord; I have obtained them from the Guru.

Those who cherish love for the Lord, their souls are always with God.
Chanting and meditating on their Beloved, they live in, and gather in, the Lord's Name. ||7||
I am a sacrifice to those Gurmukhs who serve their Beloved Lord.
They themselves are saved, along with their families, and through them, all the world is saved. ||8||
My Beloved Guru serves the Lord. Blessed is the Guru, Blessed is the Guru.
The Guru has shown me the Lord's Path; the Guru has done the greatest good deed. ||9||
