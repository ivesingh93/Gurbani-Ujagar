Whatever pleases You is good, O Beloved; Your Will is Eternal. ||7||
Nanak, those who are imbued with the Love of the All-Pervading Lord, O Beloved, remain intoxicated with His Love, in natural ease. ||8||2||4||
You know all about my condition, O Beloved; who can I speak to about it? ||1||
You are the Giver of all beings; they eat and wear what You give them. ||2||
Pleasure and pain come by Your Will, O Beloved; they do not come from any other. ||3||
Whatever You cause me to do, that I do, O Beloved; I cannot do anything else. ||4||
All my days and nights are blessed, O Beloved, when I chant and meditate on the Lord's Name. ||5||
He does the deeds, O Beloved, which are pre-ordained, and inscribed upon his forehead. ||6||
The One is Himself prevailing everywhere, O Beloved; He is pervading in each and every heart. ||7||
Lift me up out of the deep pit of the world, O Beloved; Nanak has taken to Your Sanctuary. ||8||3||22||15||2||42||
Raag Aasaa, First Mehl, Patee Likhee ~ The Poem Of The Alphabet:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Sassa: He who created the world, is the One Lord and Master of all.
Those whose consciousness remains committed to His Service - blessed is their birth and their coming into the world. ||1||
O mind, why forget Him? You foolish mind!
When your account is adjusted, O brother, only then shall you be judged wise. ||1||Pause||
Eevree: The Primal Lord is the Giver; He alone is True.
No accounting is due from the Gurmukh who understands the Lord through these letters. ||2||
Ooraa: Sing the Praises of the One whose limit cannot be found.
Those who perform service and practice truth, obtain the fruits of their rewards. ||3||
Nganga: One who understands spiritual wisdom becomes a Pandit, a religious scholar.
One who recognizes the One Lord among all beings does not talk of ego. ||4||
Kakka: When the hair grows grey, then it shines without shampoo.
The hunters of the King of Death come, and bind him in the chains of Maya. ||5||
Khakha: The Creator is the King of the world; He enslaves by giving nourishment.
By His Binding, all the world is bound; no other Command prevails. ||6||
Gagga: One who renounces the singing of the songs of the Lord of the Universe, becomes arrogant in his speech.
One who has shaped the pots, and made the world the kiln, decides when to put them in it. ||7||
Ghagha: The servant who performs service, remains attached to the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
One who recognizes bad and good as one and the same - in this way he is absorbed into the Lord and Master. ||8||
Chacha: He created the four Vedas, the four sources of creation, and the four ages -
through each and every age, He Himself has been the Yogi, the enjoyer, the Pandit and the scholar. ||9||
