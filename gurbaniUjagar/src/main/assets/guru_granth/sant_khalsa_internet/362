their pains of birth and death are taken away. They are automatically ushered into the Court of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
One who has tasted the Shabad, obtains the true flavor.
The Name of the Lord abides within his mind.
The Lord God is Eternal and All-pervading.
He Himself is near, and He Himself is far away. ||2||
Everyone talks and speaks through speech;
the Lord Himself forgives, and unites us with Himself.
By merely speaking and talking, He is not obtained.
By Guru's Grace, He comes to abide in the mind. ||3||
The Gurmukh eradicates his self-conceit from within.
He is imbued with the Lord's Love, having discarded worldly attachment.
He contemplates the utterly Immaculate Word of the Guru's Shabad.
O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is our Salvation. ||4||4||43||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
Attached to the love of duality, one only incurs pain.
Without the Word of the Shabad, one's life is wasted away in vain.
Serving the True Guru, understanding is obtained,
and then, one is not attached to the love of duality. ||1||
Those who hold fast to their roots, become acceptable.
Night and day, they meditate within their hearts on the Lord's Name; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they know the One Lord. ||1||Pause||
One who is attached to the branch, does not receive the fruits.
For blind actions, blind punishment is received.
The blind, self-willed manmukh finds no place of rest.
He is a maggot in manure, and in manure he shall rot away. ||2||
Serving the Guru, everlasting peace is obtained.
Joining the True Congregation, the Sat Sangat, the Glorious Praises of the Lord are sung.
One who contemplates the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
saves himself, and his family as well. ||3||
Through the Word of the Guru's Bani, the Naam resounds;
O Nanak, through the Word of the Shabad, one finds the Mansion of the Lord's Presence within the home of the heart.
Under Guru's Instruction, bathe in the Pool of Truth, in the Water of the Lord;
thus the filth of evil-mindedness and sin shall all be washed away. ||4||5||44||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
The self-willed manmukhs are dying; they are wasting away in death.
In the love of duality, they murder their own souls.
Crying out, "Mine, mine!", they are ruined.
They do not remember their souls; they are asleep in superstition. ||1||
He alone dies a real death, who dies in the Word of the Shabad.
The Guru has inspired me to realize, that praise and slander are one and the same; in this world, the profit is obtained by chanting the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Those who lack the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are dissolved within the womb.
Useless is the birth of those who are lured by duality.
Without the Naam, all are burning in pain.
The Perfect True Guru has given me this understanding. ||2||
The fickle mind is struck down so many times.
Having lost this opportunity, no place of rest shall be found.
Cast into the womb of reincarnation, the mortal lives in manure;
in such a home, the self-willed manmukh takes up residence. ||3||
I am forever a sacrifice to my True Guru;
the light of the Gurmukh blends with the Divine Light of the Lord.
Through the Immaculate Bani of the Word, the mortal dwells within the home of his own inner self.
O Nanak, he conquers his ego, and remains forever detached. ||4||6||45||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
The Lord's slave sets aside his own social status.
He dedicates his mind and body to the True Guru, and seeks His Sanctuary.
