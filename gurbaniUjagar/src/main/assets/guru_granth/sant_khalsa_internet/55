Through the Shabad, they recognize the Dear Lord; through the Guru's Word, they are attuned to Truth.
Filth does not stick to the body of one who has secured a dwelling in his True Home.
When the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace, we obtain the True Name. Without the Name, who are our relatives? ||5||
Those who have realized the Truth are at peace throughout the four ages.
Subduing their egotism and desires, they keep the True Name enshrined in their hearts.
In this world, the only real profit is the Name of the One Lord; it is earned by contemplating the Guru. ||6||
Loading the Merchandise of the True Name, you shall gather in your profits forever with the Capital of Truth.
In the Court of the True One, you shall sit in truthful devotion and prayer.
Your account shall be settled with honor, in the Radiant Light of the Name of the Lord. ||7||
The Lord is said to be the Highest of the High; no one can perceive Him.
Wherever I look, I see only You. The True Guru has inspired me to see You.
The Divine Light within is revealed, O Nanak, through this intuitive understanding. ||8||3||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
The fish did not notice the net in the deep and salty sea.
It was so clever and beautiful, but why was it so confident?
By its actions it was caught, and now death cannot be turned away from its head. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, just like this, see death hovering over your own heads!
People are just like this fish; unaware, the noose of death descends upon them. ||1||Pause||
The whole world is bound by death; without the Guru, death cannot be avoided.
Those who are attuned to Truth are saved; they renounce duality and corruption.
I am a sacrifice to those who are found to be Truthful in the True Court. ||2||
Think of the hawk preying on the birds, and the net in the hands of the hunter.
Those who are protected by the Guru are saved; the others are caught by the bait.
Without the Name, they are picked up and thrown away; they have no friends or companions. ||3||
God is said to be the Truest of the True; His Place is the Truest of the True.
Those who obey the True One-their minds abide in true meditation.
Those who become Gurmukh, and obtain spiritual wisdom-their minds and mouths are known to be pure. ||4||
Offer your most sincere prayers to the True Guru, so that He may unite you with your Best Friend.
Meeting your Best Friend, you shall find peace; the Messenger of Death shall take poison and die.
I dwell deep within the Name; the Name has come to dwell within my mind. ||5||
Without the Guru, there is only pitch darkness; without the Shabad, understanding is not obtained.
Through the Guru's Teachings, you shall be enlightened; remain absorbed in the Love of the True Lord.
Death does not go there; your light shall merge with the Light. ||6||
You are my Best Friend; You are All-knowing. You are the One who unites us with Yourself.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, we praise You; You have no end or limitation.
Death does not reach that place, where the Infinite Word of the Guru's Shabad resounds. ||7||
By the Hukam of His Command, all are created. By His Command, actions are performed.
By His Command, all are subject to death; by His Command, they merge in Truth.
O Nanak, whatever pleases His Will comes to pass. Nothing is in the hands of these beings. ||8||4||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
If the mind is polluted, then the body is polluted, and the tongue is polluted as well.
