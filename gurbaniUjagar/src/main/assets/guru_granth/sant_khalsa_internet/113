You Yourself create, destroy and adorn. O Nanak, we are adorned and embellished with the Naam. ||8||5||6||
Maajh, Third Mehl:
He is the Enjoyer of all hearts.
The Invisible, Inaccessible and Infinite is pervading everywhere.
Meditating on my Lord God, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I am intuitively absorbed in the Truth. ||1||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who implant the Word of the Guru's Shabad in their minds.
When someone understands the Shabad, then he wrestles with his own mind; subduing his desires, he merges with the Lord. ||1||Pause||
The five enemies are plundering the world.
The blind, self-willed manmukhs do not understand or appreciate this.
Those who become Gurmukh-their houses are protected. The five enemies are destroyed by the Shabad. ||2||
The Gurmukhs are forever imbued with love for the True One.
They serve God with intuitive ease. Night and day, they are intoxicated with His Love.
Meeting with their Beloved, they sing the Glorious Praises of the True one; they are honored in the Court of the Lord. ||3||
First, the One created Himself;
second, the sense of duality; third, the three-phased Maya.
The fourth state, the highest, is obtained by the Gurmukh, who practices Truth, and only Truth. ||4||
Everything which is pleasing to the True Lord is true.
Those who know the Truth merge in intuitive peace and poise.
The life-style of the Gurmukh is to serve the True Lord. He goes and blends with the True Lord. ||5||
Without the True One, there is no other at all.
Attached to duality, the world is distracted and distressed to death.
One who becomes Gurmukh knows only the One. Serving the One, peace is obtained. ||6||
All beings and creatures are in the Protection of Your Sanctuary.
You place the chessmen on the board; You see the imperfect and the perfect as well.
Night and day, You cause people to act; You unite them in Union with Yourself. ||7||
You Yourself unite, and You see Yourself close at hand.
You Yourself are totally pervading amongst all.
O Nanak, God Himself is pervading and permeating everywhere; only the Gurmukhs understand this. ||8||6||7||
Maajh, Third Mehl:
The Nectar of the Guru's Bani is very sweet.
Rare are the Gurmukhs who see and taste it.
The Divine Light dawns within, and the supreme essence is found. In the True Court, the Word of the Shabad vibrates. ||1||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who focus their consciousness on the Guru's Feet.
The True Guru is the True Pool of Nectar; bathing in it, the mind is washed clean of all filth. ||1||Pause||
Your limits, O True Lord, are not known to anyone.
Rare are those who, by Guru's Grace, focus their consciousness on You.
Praising You, I am never satisfied; such is the hunger I feel for the True Name. ||2||
I see only the One, and no other.
By Guru's Grace, I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar.
My thirst is quenched by the Word of the Guru's Shabad; I am absorbed in intuitive peace and poise. ||3||
The Priceless Jewel is discarded like straw;
the blind self-willed manmukhs are attached to the love of duality.
As they plant, so do they harvest. They shall not obtain peace, even in their dreams. ||4||
Those who are blessed with His Mercy find the Lord.
The Word of the Guru's Shabad abides in the mind.
