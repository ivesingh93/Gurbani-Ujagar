By Guru's Grace, a few rare ones are saved; I am a sacrifice to those humble beings. ||3||
The One who created the Universe, that Lord alone knows. His beauty is incomparable.
O Nanak, the Lord Himself gazes upon it, and is pleased. The Gurmukh contemplates God. ||4||3||14||
Soohee, Fourth Mehl:
All that happens, and all that will happen, is by His Will. If we could do something by ourselves, we would.
By ourselves, we cannot do anything at all. As it pleases the Lord, He preserves us. ||1||
O my Dear Lord, everything is in Your power.
I have no power to do anything at all. As it pleases You, You forgive us. ||1||Pause||
You Yourself bless us with soul, body and everything. You Yourself cause us to act.
As You issue Your Commands, so do we act, according to our pre-ordained destiny. ||2||
You created the entire Universe out of the five elements; if anyone can create a sixth, let him.
You unite some with the True Guru, and cause them to understand, while others, the self-willed manmukhs, do their deeds and cry out in pain. ||3||
I cannot describe the glorious greatness of the Lord; I am foolish, thoughtless, idiotic and lowly.
Please, forgive servant Nanak, O my Lord and Master; I am ignorant, but I have entered Your Sanctuary. ||4||4||15||24||
Raag Soohee, Fifth Mehl, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The actor stages the play,
playing the many characters in different costumes;
but when the play ends, he takes off the costumes,
and then he is one, and only one. ||1||
How many forms and images appeared and disappeared?
Where have they gone? Where did they come from? ||1||Pause||
Countless waves rise up from the water.
Jewels and ornaments of many different forms are fashioned from gold.
I have seen seeds of all kinds being planted -
when the fruit ripens, the seeds appear in the same form as the original. ||2||
The one sky is reflected in thousands of water jugs,
but when the jugs are broken, only the sky remains.
Doubt comes from greed, emotional attachment and the corruption of Maya.
Freed from doubt, one realizes the One Lord alone. ||3||
He is imperishable; He will never pass away.
He does not come, and He does not go.
The Perfect Guru has washed away the filth of ego.
Says Nanak, I have obtained the supreme status. ||4||1||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
Whatever God wills, that alone happens.
Without You, there is no other at all.
The humble being serves Him, and so all his works are perfectly successful.
O Lord, please preserve the honor of Your slaves. ||1||
I seek Your Sanctuary, O Perfect, Merciful Lord.
Without You, who would cherish and love me? ||1||Pause||
He is permeating and pervading the water, the land and the sky.
God dwells near at hand; He is not far away.
By trying to please other people, nothing is accomplished.
When someone is attached to the True Lord, his ego is taken away. ||2||
