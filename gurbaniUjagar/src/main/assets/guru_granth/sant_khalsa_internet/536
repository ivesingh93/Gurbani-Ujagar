Make servant Nanak the slave of Your slave; let his head roll in the dust under the feet of the Holy. ||2||4||37||
Raag Dayv-Gandhaaree, Fifth Mehl, Seventh House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
You are all-powerful, at all times; You show me the Way; I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to You.
Your Saints sing to You with love; I fall at their feet. ||1||Pause||
O Praiseworthy Lord, Enjoyer of celestial peace, Embodiment of mercy, One Infinite Lord, Your place is so beautiful. ||1||
Riches, supernatural spiritual powers and wealth are in the palm of Your hand. O Lord, Life of the World, Master of all, infinite is Your Name.
Show Kindness, Mercy and Compassion to Nanak; hearing Your Praises, I live. ||2||1||38||6||44||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Raag Dayv-Gandhaaree, Ninth Mehl:
This mind does not follow my advice one tiny bit.
I am so tired of giving it instructions - it will not refrain from its evil-mindedness. ||1||Pause||
It has gone insane with the intoxication of Maya; it does not chant the Lord's Praise.
Practicing deception, it tries to cheat the world, and so it fills its belly. ||1||
Like a dog's tail, it cannot be straightened; it will not listen to what I tell it.
Says Nanak, vibrate forever the Name of the Lord, and all your affairs shall be adjusted. ||2||1||
Raag Dayv-Gandhaaree, Ninth Mehl:
All things are mere diversions of life:
mother, father, siblings, children, relatives and the wife of your home. ||1||Pause||
When the soul is separated from the body, then they will cry out, calling you a ghost.
No one will let you stay, for even half an hour; they drive you out of the house. ||1||
The created world is like an illusion, a mirage - see this, and reflect upon it in your mind.
Says Nanak, vibrate forever the Name of the Lord, which shall deliver you. ||2||2||
Raag Dayv-Gandhaaree, Ninth Mehl:
In this world, I have seen love to be false.
Whether they are spouses or friends, all are concerned only with their own happiness. ||1||Pause||
All say, "Mine, mine", and attach their consciousness to you with love.
But at the very last moment, none shall go along with you. How strange are the ways of the world! ||1||
The foolish mind has not yet reformed itself, although I have grown weary of continually instructing it.
O Nanak, one crosses over the terrifying world-ocean, singing the Songs of God. ||2||3||6||38||47||
