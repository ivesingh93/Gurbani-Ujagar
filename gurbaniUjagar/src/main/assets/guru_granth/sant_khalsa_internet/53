O Siblings of Destiny, service to the True Guru alone is True.
When the True Guru is pleased, we obtain the Perfect, Unseen, Unknowable Lord. ||1||Pause||
I am a sacrifice to the True Guru, who has bestowed the True Name.
Night and day, I praise the True One; I sing the Glorious Praises of the True One.
True is the food, and true are the clothes, of those who chant the True Name of the True One. ||2||
With each breath and morsel of food, do not forget the Guru, the Embodiment of Fulfillment.
None is seen to be as great as the Guru. Meditate on Him twenty-four hours a day.
As He casts His Glance of Grace, we obtain the True Name, the Treasure of Excellence. ||3||
The Guru and the Transcendent Lord are one and the same, pervading and permeating amongst all.
Those who have such pre-ordained destiny, meditate on the Naam.
Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Guru, who does not die, or come and go in reincarnation. ||4||30||100||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Siree Raag, First Mehl, First House, Ashtapadees:
I speak and chant His Praises, vibrating the instrument of my mind. The more I know Him, the more I vibrate it.
The One, unto whom we vibrate and sing-how great is He, and where is His Place?
Those who speak of Him and praise Him-they all continue speaking of Him with love. ||1||
O Baba, the Lord Allah is Inaccessible and Infinite.
Sacred is His Name, and Sacred is His Place. He is the True Cherisher. ||1||Pause||
The extent of Your Command cannot be seen; no one knows how to write it.
Even if a hundred poets met together, they could not describe even a tiny bit of it.
No one has found Your Value; they all merely write what they have heard again and again. ||2||
The Pirs, the Prophets, the spiritual teachers, the faithful, the innocents and the martyrs,
the Shaikhs, the mystics, the Qazis, the Mullahs and the Dervishes at His Door -
they are blessed all the more as they continue reading their prayers in praise to Him. ||3||
He seeks no advice when He builds; He seeks no advice when He destroys. He seeks no advice while giving or taking.
He alone knows His Creative Power; He Himself does all deeds.
He beholds all in His Vision. He gives to those with whom He is pleased. ||4||
His Place and His Name are not known, no one knows how great is His Name.
How great is that place where my Sovereign Lord dwells?
No one can reach it; whom shall I go and ask? ||5||
One class of people does not like the other, when one has been made great.
Greatness is only in His Great Hands; He gives to those with whom He is pleased.
By the Hukam of His Command, He Himself regenerates, without a moment's delay. ||6||
Everyone cries out, "More! More!", with the idea of receiving.
How great should we call the Giver? His Gifts are beyond estimation.
O Nanak, there is no deficiency; Your Storehouses are filled to overflowing, age after age. ||7||1||
First Mehl:
All are brides of the Husband Lord; all decorate themselves for Him.
