Servant Nanak's mind is filled with bliss, when he beholds the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, even for an instant. ||2||39||13||15||67||
Raag Aasaa, Second House, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
One who loves her, is ultimately devoured.
One who seats her in comfort, is totally terrified by her.
Siblings, friends and family, beholding her, argue.
But she has come under my control, by Guru's Grace. ||1||
Beholding her, all are bewitched:
the strivers, the Siddhas, the demi-gods, angels and mortals. All, except the Saadhus, are deceived by her deception. ||1||Pause||
Some wander around as renunciates, but they are engrossed in sexual desire.
Some grow rich as householders, but she does not belong to them.
Some call themselves men of charity, and she torments them terribly.
The Lord has saved me, by attaching me to the Feet of the True Guru. ||2||
She leads astray the penitents who practice penance.
The scholarly Pandits are all seduced by greed.
The world of the three qualities is enticed, and the heavens are enticed.
The True Guru has saved me, by giving me His Hand. ||3||
She is the slave of those who are spiritually wise.
With her palms pressed together, she serves them and offers her prayer:
Whatever you wish, that is what I shall do.
O servant Nanak, she does not draw near to the Gurmukh. ||4||1||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
I have been separated from my Beloved by Maya (my mother-in-law).
Hope and desire (my younger brother-in-law and sister-in-law) are dying of grief.
I am no longer swayed by the fear of Death (my elder brother-in-law).
I am protected by my All-knowing, Wise Husband Lord. ||1||
Listen, O people: I have tasted the elixir of love.
The evil ones are dead, and my enemies are destroyed. The True Guru has given me the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
First, I renounced my egotistical love of myself.
Second, I renounced the ways of the world.
Renouncing the three qualities, I look alike upon friend and enemy.
And then, the fourth state of bliss was revealed to me by the Holy One. ||2||
In the cave of celestial bliss, I have obtained a seat.
The Lord of Light plays the unstruck melody of bliss.
I am in ecstasy, contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
Imbued with my Beloved Husband Lord, I am the blessed, happy soul-bride. ||3||
Servant Nanak chants the wisdom of God;
one who listens and practices it, is carried across and saved.
He is not born, and he does not die; he does not come or go.
He remains blended with the Lord. ||4||2||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The bride shows such special devotion, and has such an agreeable disposition.
Her beauty is incomparable, and her character is perfect.
The house in which she dwells is such a praiseworthy house.
But rare are those who, as Gurmukh, attain that state||1||
As the soul-bride of pure actions, I have met with the Guru.
In worship, marriage and in the next world, such a soul-bride looks beautiful. ||1||Pause||
