You Yourself created the Universe;
You created the play of duality, and staged it.
The Truest of the True is pervading everywhere; He instructs those with whom He is pleased. ||20||
By Guru's Grace, I have found God.
By His Grace, I have shed emotional attachment to Maya.
Showering His Mercy, He has blended me into Himself. ||21||
You are the Gopis, the milk-maids of Krishna; You are the sacred river Jamunaa; You are Krishna, the herdsman.
You Yourself support the world.
By Your Command, human beings are fashioned. You Yourself embellish them, and then again destroy them. ||22||
Those who have focused their consciousness on the True Guru,
have rid themselves of the love of duality.
The light of those mortal beings is immaculate. They depart after redeeming their lives. ||23||
Your Goodness, I forever,
admire by night and day.
You bestow Your Gifts, even if we do not ask for them. Says Nanak, contemplate the True Lord. ||24||1||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
I fall at His Feet to please and appease Him.
The True Guru has united me with the Lord, the Primal Being. There is no other as great as He. ||1||Pause||
The Lord of the Universe is my Sweet Beloved.
He is sweeter than my mother or father.
Among all sisters and brothers and friends, there is no one like You. ||1||
By Your Command, the month of Saawan has come.
I have hooked up the plow of Truth,
and I plant the seed of the Name in hopes that the Lord, in His Generosity, will bestow a bountiful harvest. ||2||
Meeting with the Guru, I recognize only the One Lord.
In my consciousness, I do not know of any other account.
The Lord has assigned one task to me; as it pleases Him, I perform it. ||3||
Enjoy yourselves and eat, O Siblings of Destiny.
In the Guru's Court, He has blessed me with the Robe of Honor.
I have become the Master of my body-village; I have taken the five rivals as prisoners. ||4||
I have come to Your Sanctuary.
The five farm-hands have become my tenants;
none dare to raise their heads against me. O Nanak, my village is populous and prosperous. ||5||
I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to You.
I meditate on You continually.
The village was in ruins, but You have re-populated it. I am a sacrifice to You. ||6||
O Beloved Lord, I meditate on You continually;
I obtain the fruits of my mind's desires.
All my affairs are arranged, and the hunger of my mind is appeased. ||7||
I have forsaken all my entanglements;
I serve the True Lord of the Universe.
I have firmly attached the Name, the Home of the Nine Treasures to my robe. ||8||
I have obtained the comfort of comforts.
The Guru has implanted the Word of the Shabad deep within me.
The True Guru has shown me my Husband Lord; He has placed His Hand upon my forehead. ||9||
I have established the Temple of Truth.
I sought out the Guru's Sikhs, and brought them into it.
I wash their feet, and wave the fan over them. Bowing low, I fall at their feet. ||10||
