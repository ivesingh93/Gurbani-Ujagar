Aasaa:
They wear loin cloths, three and a half yards long, and triple-wound sacred threads.
They have rosaries around their necks, and they carry glittering jugs in their hands.
They are not called Saints of the Lord - they are thugs of Benares. ||1||
Such 'saints' are not pleasing to me;
they eat the trees along with the branches. ||1||Pause||
They wash their pots and pans before putting them on the stove, and they wash the wood before lighting it.
They dig up the earth and make two fireplaces, but they eat the whole person! ||2||
Those sinners continually wander in evil deeds, while they call themselves touch-nothing saints.
They wander around forever and ever in their self-conceit, and all their families are drowned. ||3||
He is attached to that, to which the Lord has attached him, and he acts accordingly.
Says Kabeer, one who meets the True Guru, is not reincarnated again. ||4||2||
Aasaa:
My Father has comforted me.
He has given me a cozy bed, and placed His Ambrosial Nectar in my mouth.
How could I forget that Father from my mind?
When I go to the world hereafter, I shall not lose the game. ||1||
Maya is dead, O mother, and I am very happy.
I do not wear the patched coat, nor do I feel the chill. ||1||Pause||
I am a sacrifice to my Father, who gave me life.
He put an end to my association with the five deadly sins.
I have conquered those five demons, and trampled them underfoot.
Remembering the Lord in meditation, my mind and body are drenched with His Love. ||2||
My Father is the Great Lord of the Universe.
How shall I go to that Father?
When I met the True Guru, He showed me the Way.
The Father of the Universe is pleasing to my mind. ||3||
I am Your son, and You are my Father.
We both dwell in the same place.
Says Kabeer, the Lord's humble servant knows only the One.
By Guru's Grace, I have come to know everything. ||4||3||
Aasaa:
In one pot, they put a boiled chicken, and in the other pot, they put wine.
The five Yogis of the Tantric ritual sit there, and in their midst sits the noseless one, the shameless queen. ||1||
The bell of the shameless queen, Maya, rings in both worlds.
Some rare person of discriminating wisdom has cut off your nose. ||1||Pause||
Within all dwells the noseless Maya, who kills all, and destroys them.
She says, "I am the sister, and the daughter of the sister of everyone; I am the hand-maiden of one who marries me". ||2||
My Husband is the Great One of discriminating wisdom; He alone is called a Saint.
He stands by me, and no one else comes near me. ||3||
I have cut off her nose, and cut off her ears, and cutting her into bits, I have expelled her.
Says Kabeer, she is the darling of the three worlds, but the enemy of the Saints. ||4||4||
Aasaa:
The Yogis, celibates, penitents and Sannyaasees make pilgrimages to all the sacred places.
The Jains with shaven heads, the silent ones, the beggars with matted hair - in the end, they all shall die. ||1||
Meditate, therefore, on the Lord.
What can the Messenger of Death do to one whose tongue loves the Name of the Lord? ||1||Pause||
Those who know the Shaastras and the Vedas, astrology and the rules of grammar of many languages;
