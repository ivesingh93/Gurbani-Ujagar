His body becomes golden, by the Lord's Incomparable Light.
He beholds the divine beauty in all the three worlds.
That inexhaustible wealth of Truth is now in my lap. ||4||
In the five elements, the three worlds, the nine regions and the four directions, the Lord is pervading.
He supports the earth and the sky, exercising His almighty power.
He turns the outgoing mind around. ||5||
The fool does not realize what he sees with his eyes.
He does not taste with his tongue, and does not understand what is said.
Intoxicated with poison, he argues with the world. ||6||
In the uplifting society, one is uplifted.
He chases after virtue and washes off his sins.
Without serving the Guru, celestial poise is not obtained. ||7||
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is a diamond, a jewel, a ruby.
The pearl of the mind is the inner wealth.
O Nanak, the Lord tests us, and blesses us with His Glance of Grace. ||8||5||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
The Gurmukh obtains spiritual wisdom, meditation and satisfaction of the mind.
The Gurmukh realizes the Mansion of the Lord's Presence.
The Gurmukh is attuned to the Word of the Shabad, as his Insignia. ||1||
Such is the loving devotional worship of the Lord's contemplation.
The Gurmukh realizes the True Name, the Destroyer of ego. ||1||Pause||
Day and night, he remains immaculately pure, and abides in the sublime place.
He gains the wisdom of the three worlds.
Through the True Guru, the Command of the Lord's Will is realized. ||2||
He enjoys true pleasure, and suffers no pain.
He enjoys the ambrosial wisdom, and the highest sublime essence.
He overcomes the five evil passions, and becomes the happiest of all men. ||3||
Your Divine Light is contained in all; everyone belongs to You.
You Yourself join and separate again.
Whatever the Creator does, comes to pass. ||4||
He demolishes, and He builds; by His Order, he merges us into Himself.
Whatever is pleasing to His Will, happens.
Without the Guru, no one obtains the Perfect Lord. ||5||
In childhood and old age, he does not understand.
In the prime of youth, he is drowned in his pride.
Without the Name, what can the fool obtain? ||6||
He does not know the One who blesses him with nourishment and wealth.
Deluded by doubt, he later regrets and repents.
The noose of death is around the neck of that crazy madman. ||7||
I saw the world drowning, and I ran away in fear.
How very fortunate are those who have been saved by the True Guru.
O Nanak, they are attached to the feet of the Guru. ||8||6||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
They sing religious songs, but their consciousness is wicked.
They sing the songs, and call themselves divine,
but without the Name, their minds are false and wicked. ||1||
Where are you going? O mind, remain in your own home.
The Gurmukhs are satisfied with the Lord's Name; searching, they easily find the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Sexual desire, anger and emotional attachment fill the mind and body;
greed and egotism lead only to pain.
How can the mind be comforted without the Lord's Name? ||2||
One who cleanses himself within, knows the True Lord.
The Gurmukh knows the condition of his innermost being.
Without the True Word of the Shabad, the Mansion of the Lord's Presence is not realized. ||3||
One who merges his form into the Formless Lord,
abides in the True Lord, the Powerful, beyond power.
Such a person does not enter into the womb of reincarnation again. ||4||
Go there, where you may obtain the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
