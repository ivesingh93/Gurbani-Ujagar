Nanak has obtained the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||4||27||78||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Those who are attuned to their Lord and Master
are satisfied and fulfilled with the perfect food. ||1||
The Lord's devotees never run short of anything.
They have plenty to eat, spend, enjoy and give. ||1||Pause||
One who has the Unfathomable Lord of the Universe as his Master -
how can any mere mortal stand up to him? ||2||
One who is served by the eighteen supernatural powers of the Siddhas -
grasp his feet, even for an instant. ||3||
That one, upon whom You have showered Your Mercy, O my Lord Master -
says Nanak, he does not lack anything. ||4||28||79||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
When I meditate on my True Guru,
my mind becomes supremely peaceful. ||1||
The record of my account is erased, and my doubts are dispelled.
Imbued with the Naam, the Name of the Lord, His humble servant is blessed with good fortune. ||1||Pause||
When I remember my Lord and Master,
my fears are dispelled, O my friend. ||2||
When I took to Your Protection, O God,
my desires were fulfilled. ||3||
Gazing upon the wonder of Your play, my mind has become encouraged.
Servant Nanak relies on You alone. ||4||29||80||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Night and day, the mouse of time gnaws away at the rope of life.
Falling into the well, the mortal eats the sweet treats of Maya. ||1||
Thinking and planning, the night of the life is passing away.
Thinking of the many pleasures of Maya, the mortal never remembers the Lord, the Sustainer of the earth. ||1||Pause||
Believing the shade of the tree to be permanent, he builds his house beneath it.
But the noose of death is around his neck, and Shakti, the power of Maya, has aimed her arrows at him. ||2||
The sandy shore is being washed away by the waves,
but the fool still believes that place to be permanent. ||3||
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, chant the Name of the Lord, the King.
Nanak lives by singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||4||30||81||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Du-Tukas 9:
With that, you are engaged in playful sport;
with that, I am joined to you.
With that, everyone longs for you;
without it, no one would even look at your face. ||1||
Where is that detached soul now contained?
Without it, you are miserable. ||1||Pause||
With that, you are the woman of the house;
with that, you are respected.
With that, you are caressed;
without it, you are reduced to dust. ||2||
With that, you have honor and respect;
with that, you have relatives in the world.
With that, you are adorned in every way;
without it, you are reduced to dust. ||3||
That detached soul is neither born, nor dies.
It acts according to the Command of the Lord's Will.
O Nanak, having fashioned the body, the Lord unites the soul with it, and separates them again;
He alone knows His All-powerful creative nature. ||4||31||82||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
