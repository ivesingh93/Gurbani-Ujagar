With your tongue, repeat the True Name, and your mind and body shall become pure.
Your mother and father and all your relations-without Him, there are none at all.
If God Himself bestows His Mercy, then He is not forgotten, even for an instant. ||1||
O my mind, serve the True One, as long as you have the breath of life.
Without the True One, everything is false; in the end, all shall perish. ||1||Pause||
My Lord and Master is Immaculate and Pure; without Him, I cannot even survive.
Within my mind and body, there is such a great hunger; if only someone would come and unite me with Him, O my mother!
I have searched the four corners of the world-without our Husband Lord, there is no other place of rest. ||2||
Offer your prayers to Him, who shall unite you with the Creator.

Those unto whom He is Merciful, receive His Grace. ||1||
O my mind, there is no other as great as the Guru.
I cannot imagine any other place. The Guru leads me to meet the True Lord. ||1||Pause||
Those who go to see the Guru obtain all treasures.
Those whose minds are attached to the Guru's Feet are very fortunate, O my mother.
The Guru is the Giver, the Guru is All-powerful. The Guru is All-pervading, contained amongst all.
The Guru is the Transcendent Lord, the Supreme Lord God. The Guru lifts up and saves those who are drowning. ||2||
How shall I praise the Guru, the All-powerful Cause of causes?
Those, upon whose foreheads the Guru has placed His Hand, remain steady and stable.
The Guru has led me to drink in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam, the Name of the Lord; He has released me from the cycle of birth and death.
I serve the Guru, the Transcendent Lord, the Dispeller of fear; my suffering has been taken away. ||3||
