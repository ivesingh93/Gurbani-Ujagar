But if the Lord casts His Glance of Grace, then He Himself embellishes us.
O Nanak, the Gurmukhs meditate on the Lord; blessed and approved is their coming into the world. ||63||
Yoga is not obtained by wearing saffron robes; Yoga is not obtained by wearing dirty robes.
O Nanak, Yoga is obtained even while sitting in your own home, by following the Teachings of the True Guru. ||64||
You may wander in all four directions, and read the Vedas throughout the four ages.
O Nanak, if you meet with the True Guru, the Lord shall come to dwell within your mind, and you shall find the door of salvation. ||65||
O Nanak, the Hukam, the Command of your Lord and Master, is prevailing. The intellectually confused person wanders around lost, misled by his fickle consciousness.
If you make friends with the self-willed manmukhs, O friend, who can you ask for peace?
Make friends with the Gurmukhs, and focus your consciousness on the True Guru.
The root of birth and death will be cut away, and then, you shall find peace, O friend. ||66||
The Lord Himself instructs those who are misguided, when He casts His Glance of Grace.
O Nanak, those who are not blessed by His Glance of Grace, cry and weep and wail. ||67||
Shalok, Fourth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Blessed and very fortunate are those happy soul-brides who, as Gurmukh, meet their Sovereign Lord King.
The Light of God shines within them; O Nanak, they are absorbed in the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||
Waaho! Waaho! Blessed and Great is the True Guru, the Primal Being, who has realized the True Lord.
Meeting Him, thirst is quenched, and the body and mind are cooled and soothed.
Waaho! Waaho! Blessed and Great is the True Guru, the True Primal Being, who looks upon all alike.
Waaho! Waaho! Blessed and Great is the True Guru, who has no hatred; slander and praise are all the same to Him.
Waaho! Waaho! Blessed and Great is the All-knowing True Guru, who has realized God within.
Waaho! Waaho! Blessed and Great is the Formless True Guru, who has no end or limitation.
Waaho! Waaho! Blessed and Great is the True Guru, who implants the Truth within.
O Nanak, Blessed and Great is the True Guru, through whom the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is received. ||2||
For the Gurmukh, the true Song of Praise is to chant the Name of the Lord God.
Chanting the Praises of the Lord, their minds are in ecstasy.
By great good fortune, they find the Lord, the Embodiment of perfect, supreme bliss.
Servant Nanak praises the Naam, the Name of the Lord; no obstacle will block his mind or body. ||3||
I am in love with my Beloved; how can I meet my Dear Friend?
I seek that friend, who is embellished with Truth.
The True Guru is my Friend; if I meet Him, I will offer this mind as a sacrifice to Him.
He has shown me my Beloved Lord, my Friend, the Creator.
O Nanak, I was searching for my Beloved; the True Guru has shown me that He has been with me all the time. ||4||
I stand by the side of the road, waiting for You; O my Friend, I hope that You will come.
If only someone would come today and unite me in Union with my Beloved.
