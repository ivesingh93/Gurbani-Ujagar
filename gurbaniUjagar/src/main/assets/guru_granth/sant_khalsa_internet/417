Raag Aasaa, First Mehl, Ashtapadees, Third House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Those heads adorned with braided hair, with their parts painted with vermillion -
those heads were shaved with scissors, and their throats were choked with dust.
They lived in palatial mansions, but now, they cannot even sit near the palaces. ||1||
Hail to You, O Father Lord, Hail to You!
O Primal Lord. Your limits are not known; You create, and create, and behold the scenes. ||1||Pause||
When they were married, their husbands looked so handsome beside them.
They came in palanquins, decorated with ivory;
water was sprinkled over their heads, and glittering fans were waved above them. ||2||
They were given hundreds of thousands of coins when they sat, and hundreds of thousands of coins when they stood.
They ate coconuts and dates, and rested comfortably upon their beds.
But ropes were put around their necks, and their strings of pearls were broken. ||3||
Their wealth and youthful beauty, which gave them so much pleasure, have now become their enemies.
The order was given to the soldiers, who dishonored them, and carried them away.
If it is pleasing to God's Will, He bestows greatness; if is pleases His Will, He bestows punishment. ||4||
If someone focuses on the Lord beforehand, then why should he be punished?
The kings had lost their higher consciousness, reveling in pleasure and sensuality.
Since Baabar's rule has been proclaimed, even the princes have no food to eat. ||5||
The Muslims have lost their five times of daily prayer, and the Hindus have lost their worship as well.
Without their sacred squares, how shall the Hindu women bathe and apply the frontal marks to their foreheads?
They never remembered their Lord as Raam, and now they cannot even chant Khudaa-i||6||
Some have returned to their homes, and meeting their relatives, they ask about their safety.
For some, it is pre-ordained that they shall sit and cry out in pain.
Whatever pleases Him, comes to pass. O Nanak, what is the fate of mankind? ||7||11||
Aasaa, First Mehl:
Where are the games, the stables, the horses? Where are the drums and the bugles?
Where are the sword-belts and chariots? Where are those scarlet uniforms?
Where are the rings and the beautiful faces? They are no longer to be seen here. ||1||
This world is Yours; You are the Lord of the Universe.
In an instant, You establish and disestablish. You distribute wealth as it pleases You. ||1||Pause||
Where are the houses, the gates, the hotels and palaces? Where are those beautiful way-stations?
Where are those beautiful women, reclining on their beds, whose beauty would not allow one to sleep?
Where are those betel leaves, their sellers, and the harem? They have vanished like shadows. ||2||
For the sake of this wealth, so many were ruined; because of this wealth, so many have been disgraced.
It was not gathered without sin, and it does not go along with the dead.
Those, whom the Creator Lord would destroy - first He strips them of virtue. ||3||
Millions of religious leaders failed to halt the invader, when they heard of the Emperor's invasion.
