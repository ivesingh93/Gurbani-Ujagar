Your Glories are uncounted, O God, my Lord and Master.
I am an orphan, entering Your Sanctuary.
Have Mercy on me, O Lord, that I may meditate on Your Feet. ||1||
Take pity upon me, and abide within my mind;
I am worthless - please let me grasp hold of the hem of Your robe. ||1||Pause||
When God comes into my consciousness, what misfortune can strike me?
The Lord's servant does not suffer pain from the Messenger of Death.
All pains are dispelled, when one remembers the Lord in meditation;
God abides with him forever. ||2||
The Name of God is the Support of my mind and body.
Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the body is reduced to ashes.
When God comes into my consciousness, all my affairs are resolved.
Forgetting the Lord, one becomes subservient to all. ||3||
I am in love with the Lotus Feet of the Lord.
I am rid of all evil-minded ways.
The Mantra of the Lord's Name, Har, Har, is deep within my mind and body.
O Nanak, eternal bliss fills the home of the Lord's devotees. ||4||3||
Raag Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl, Second House, To Be Sung To The Tune Of Yaan-Ree-Ay:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
You are the Support of my mind, O my Beloved, You are the Support of my mind.
All other clever tricks are useless, O Beloved; You alone are my Protector. ||1||Pause||
One who meets with the Perfect True Guru, O Beloved, that humble person is enraptured.
He alone serves the Guru, O Beloved, unto whom the Lord becomes merciful.
Fruitful is the form of the Divine Guru, O Lord and Master; He is overflowing with all powers.
O Nanak, the Guru is the Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent Lord; He is ever-present, forever and ever. ||1||
I live by hearing, hearing of those who know their God.
They contemplate the Lord's Name, they chant the Lord's Name, and their minds are imbued with the Lord's Name.
I am Your servant; I beg to serve Your humble servants. By the karma of perfect destiny, I do this.
This is Nanak's prayer: O my Lord and Master, may I obtain the Blessed Vision of Your humble servants. ||2||
They are said to be very fortunate, O Beloved, who dwell in the Society of the Saints.
They contemplate the Immaculate, Ambrosial Naam, and their minds are illuminated.
The pains of birth and death are eradicated, O Beloved, and the fear of the Messenger of Death is ended.
They alone obtain the Blessed Vision of this Darshan, O Nanak, who are pleasing to their God. ||3||
O my lofty, incomparable and infinite Lord and Master, who can know Your Glorious Virtues?
Those who sing them are saved, and those who listen to them are saved; all their sins are erased.
You save the beasts, demons and fools, and even stones are carried across.
Slave Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary; he is forever and ever a sacrifice to You. ||4||1||4||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Renounce the tasteless water of corruption, O my companion, and drink in the supreme nectar of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Without the taste of this nectar, all have drowned, and their souls have not found happiness.
You have no honor, glory or power - become the slave of the Holy Saints.
