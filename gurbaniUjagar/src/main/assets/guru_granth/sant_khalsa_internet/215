Honor and dishonor are the same to me; I have placed my forehead upon the Guru's Feet.
Wealth does not excite me, and misfortune does not disturb me; I have embraced love for my Lord and Master. ||1||
The One Lord and Master dwells in the home; He is seen in the wilderness as well.
I have become fearless; the Saint has removed my doubts. The All-knowing Lord is pervading everywhere. ||2||
Whatever the Creator does, my mind is not troubled.
By the Grace of the Saints and the Company of the Holy, my sleeping mind has been awakened. ||3||
Servant Nanak seeks Your Support; he has come to Your Sanctuary.
In the Love of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he enjoys intuitive peace; pain no longer touches him. ||4||2||160||
Gauree Maalaa, Fifth Mehl:
I have found the jewel of my Beloved within my mind.
My body is cooled, my mind is cooled and soothed, and I am absorbed into the Shabad, the Word of the True Guru. ||1||Pause||
My hunger has departed, my thirst has totally departed, and all my anxiety is forgotten.
The Perfect Guru has placed His Hand upon my forehead; conquering my mind, I have conquered the whole world. ||1||
Satisfied and satiated, I remain steady within my heart, and now, I do not waver at all.
The True Guru has given me the inexhaustible treasure; it never decreases, and never runs out. ||2||
Listen to this wonder, O Siblings of Destiny: the Guru has given me this understanding.
I threw off the veil of illusion, when I met my Lord and Master; then, I forgot my jealousy of others. ||3||
This is a wonder which cannot be described. They alone know it, who have tasted it.
Says Nanak, the Truth has been revealed to me. The Guru has given me the treasure; I have taken it and enshrined it within my heart. ||4||3||161||
Gauree Maalaa, Fifth Mehl:
Those who take to the Sanctuary of the Lord, the King, are saved.
All other people, in the mansion of Maya, fall flat on their faces on the ground. ||1||Pause||
The great men have studied the Shaastras, the Simritees and the Vedas, and they have said this:
Without the Lord's meditation, there is no emancipation, and no one has ever found peace. ||1||
People may accumulate the wealth of the three worlds, but the waves of greed are still not subdued.
Without devotional worship of the Lord, where can anyone find stability? People wander around endlessly. ||2||
People engage in all sorts of mind-enticing pastimes, but their passions are not fulfilled.
They burn and burn, and are never satisfied; without the Lord's Name, it is all useless. ||3||
Chant the Name of the Lord, my friend; this is the essence of perfect peace.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, birth and death are ended. Nanak is the dust of the feet of the humble. ||4||4||162||
Gauree Maalaa, Fifth Mehl:
Who can help me understand my condition?
Only the Creator knows it. ||1||Pause||
This person does things in ignorance; he does not chant in meditation, and does not perform any deep, self-disciplined meditation.
This mind wanders around in the ten directions - how can it be restrained? ||1||
I am the lord, the master of my mind, body, wealth and lands. These are mine.
