He Himself gives His Name to those, upon whom He bestows His Mercy.
Very fortunate, O Nanak, are those people. ||8||13||
Shalok:
Give up your cleverness, good people - remember the Lord God, your King!
Enshrine in your heart, your hopes in the One Lord. O Nanak, your pain, doubt and fear shall depart. ||1||
Ashtapadee:
Reliance on mortals is in vain - know this well.
The Great Giver is the One Lord God.
By His gifts, we are satisfied,
and we suffer from thirst no longer.
The One Lord Himself destroys and also preserves.
Nothing at all is in the hands of mortal beings.
Understanding His Order, there is peace.
So take His Name, and wear it as your necklace.
Remember, remember, remember God in meditation.
O Nanak, no obstacle shall stand in your way. ||1||
Praise the Formless Lord in your mind.
O my mind, make this your true occupation.
Let your tongue become pure, drinking in the Ambrosial Nectar.
Your soul shall be forever peaceful.
With your eyes, see the wondrous play of your Lord and Master.
In the Company of the Holy, all other associations vanish.
With your feet, walk in the Way of the Lord.
Sins are washed away, chanting the Lord's Name, even for a moment.
So do the Lord's Work, and listen to the Lord's Sermon.
In the Lord's Court, O Nanak, your face shall be radiant. ||2||
Very fortunate are those humble beings in this world,
who sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, forever and ever.
Those who dwell upon the Lord's Name,
are the most wealthy and prosperous in the world.
Those who speak of the Supreme Lord in thought, word and deed -
know that they are peaceful and happy, forever and ever.
One who recognizes the One and only Lord as One,
understands this world and the next.
One whose mind accepts the Company of the Naam,
the Name of the Lord, O Nanak, knows the Immaculate Lord. ||3||
By Guru's Grace, one understands himself;
know that then, his thirst is quenched.
In the Company of the Holy, one chants the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har.
Such a devotee of the Lord is free of all disease.
Night and day, sing the Kirtan, the Praises of the One Lord.
In the midst of your household, remain balanced and unattached.
One who places his hopes in the One Lord -
the noose of Death is cut away from his neck.
One whose mind hungers for the Supreme Lord God,
O Nanak, shall not suffer pain. ||4||
One who focuses his conscious mind on the Lord God -
that Saint is at peace; he does not waver.
Those unto whom God has granted His Grace -
who do those servants need to fear?
As God is, so does He appear;
in His Own creation, He Himself is pervading.
Searching, searching, searching, and finally, success!
By Guru's Grace, the essence of all reality is understood.
Wherever I look, there I see Him, at the root of all things.
O Nanak, He is the subtle, and He is also the manifest. ||5||
Nothing is born, and nothing dies.
He Himself stages His own drama.
Coming and going, seen and unseen,
all the world is obedient to His Will.
