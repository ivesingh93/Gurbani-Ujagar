God exists in the beginning, in the middle and in the end.
Whatever the Creator Lord Himself does, comes to pass.
Doubt and fear are erased, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and then one is not afflicted by deadly pain. ||6||
I sing the most Sublime Bani, the Word of the Lord of the Universe.
I beg for the dust of the feet of the Saadh Sangat.
Eradicating desire, I have become free of desire; I have burnt away all my sins. ||7||
This is the unique way of the Saints;
they behold the Supreme Lord God with them.
With each and every breath, they worship and adore the Lord, Har, Har. How could anyone be too lazy to meditate on Him? ||8||
Wherever I look, there I see the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.
I never forget God, my Lord and Master, even for an instant.
Your slaves live by meditating, meditating in remembrance on the Lord; You are permeating the woods, the water and the land. ||9||
Even the hot wind does not touch one
who remains awake in meditative remembrance, night and day.
He delights and enjoys meditative remembrance on the Lord; he has no attachment to Maya. ||10||
Disease, sorrow and pain do not affect him;
he sings the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
Please bless me with Your Name, O my Beloved Lord God; please listen to my prayer, O Creator. ||11||
Your Name is a jewel, O my Beloved Lord.
Your slaves are imbued with Your Infinite Love.
Those who are imbued with Your Love, become like You; it is so rare that they are found. ||12||
My mind longs for the dust of the feet of those
who never forget the Lord.
Associating with them, I obtain the supreme status; the Lord, my Companion, is always with me. ||13||
He alone is my beloved friend and companion,
who implants the Name of the One Lord within, and eradicates evil-mindedness.
Immaculate are the teachings of that humble servant of the Lord, who casts out sexual desire, anger and egotism. ||14||
Other than You, O Lord, no one is mine.
The Guru has led me to grasp the feet of God.
I am a sacrifice to the Perfect True Guru, who has destroyed the illusion of duality. ||15||
With each and every breath, I never forget God.
Twenty-four hours a day, I meditate on the Lord, Har, Har.
O Nanak, the Saints are imbued with Your Love; You are the great and all-powerful Lord. ||16||4||13||
Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
I enshrine the Lord's lotus feet continually within my heart.
Each and every moment, I humbly bow to the Perfect Guru.
I dedicate my body, mind and everything, and place it in offering before the Lord. His Name is the most beautiful in this world. ||1||
Why forget the Lord and Master from your mind?
He blessed you with body and soul, creating and embellishing you.
With every breath and morsel of food, the Creator takes care of His beings, who receive according to what they have done. ||2||
No one returns empty-handed from Him;
twenty-four hours a day, keep the Lord in your mind.
