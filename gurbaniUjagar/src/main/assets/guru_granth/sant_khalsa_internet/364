By Guru's Grace, one serves Him. ||1||
With the jewel of spiritual wisdom, total understanding is obtained.
By Guru's Grace, ignorance is dispelled; one then remains wakeful, night and day, and beholds the True Lord. ||1||Pause||
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, attachment and pride are burnt away.
From the Perfect Guru, true understanding is obtained.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, one realizes the Lord's Presence within.
Then, one's coming and going cease, and one becomes stable, absorbed in the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||
The world is tied to birth and death.
The unconscious, self-willed manmukh is enveloped in the darkness of Maya and emotional attachment.
He slanders others, and practices utter falsehood.
He is a maggot in manure, and into manure he is absorbed. ||3||
Joining the True Congregation, the Sat Sangat, total understanding is obtained.

Aasaa, Third Mehl, Panch-Padas:
One who dies in the Word of the Shabad, finds eternal bliss.
He is united with the True Guru, the Guru, the Lord God.
He does not die any more, and he does not come or go.
Through the Perfect Guru, he merges with the True Lord. ||1||
One who has the Naam, the Name of the Lord, written in his pre-ordained destiny,
night and day, meditates forever on the Naam; he obtains the wondrous blessing of devotional love from the Perfect Guru. ||1||Pause||
Those, whom the Lord God has blended with Himself -
their sublime state cannot be described.
The Perfect True Guru has given the Glorious Greatness,
of the most exalted order, and I am absorbed into the Lord's Name. ||2||
Whatever the Lord does, He does all by Himself.
In an instant, He establishes, and disestablishes.
By merely speaking, talking, shouting and preaching about the Lord,
even hundreds of times, the mortal is not approved. ||3||
The Guru meets with those, who take virtue as their treasure;
they listen to the True Word of the Guru's Bani, the Shabad.
Pain departs, from that place where the Shabad abides.
By the jewel of spiritual wisdom, one is easily absorbed into the True Lord. ||4||

It is bestowed only by the True Lord.
Through the Perfect Word of the Shabad, it abides in the mind.
O Nanak, imbued with the Naam, peace is obtained. ||5||11||50||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
One may dance and play numerous instruments;
but this mind is blind and deaf, so for whose benefit is this speaking and preaching?
Deep within is the fire of greed, and the dust-storm of doubt.
The lamp of knowledge is not burning, and understanding is not obtained. ||1||
The Gurmukh has the light of devotional worship within his heart.
Understanding his own self, he meets God. ||1||Pause||
The Gurmukh's dance is to embrace love for the Lord;
to the beat of the drum, he sheds his ego from within.
My God is True; He Himself is the Knower of all.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, recognize the Creator Lord within yourself. ||2||
The Gurmukh is filled with devotional love for the Beloved Lord.
He intuitively reflects upon the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
For the Gurmukh, loving devotional worship is the way to the True Lord.
But the dances and the worship of the hypocrites bring only pain. ||3||
True Devotion is to remain dead while yet alive.
