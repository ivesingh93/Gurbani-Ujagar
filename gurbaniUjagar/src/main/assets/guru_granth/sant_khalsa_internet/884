Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
God has made me His own, and vanquished all my enemies.
Those enemies who have plundered this world, have all been placed in bondage. ||1||
The True Guru is my Transcendent Lord.
I enjoy countless pleasures of power and tasty delights, chanting Your Name, and placing my faith in You. ||1||Pause||
I do not think of any other at all. The Lord is my protector, above my head.
I am carefree and independent, when I have the Support of Your Name, O my Lord and Master. ||2||
I have become perfect, meeting with the Giver of peace, and now, I lack nothing at all.
I have obtained the essence of excellence, the supreme status; I shall not forsake it to go anywhere else. ||3||
I cannot describe how You are, O True Lord, unseen, infinite,
immeasurable, unfathomable and unmoving Lord. O Nanak, He is my Lord and Master. ||4||5||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
You are wise; You are eternal and unchanging. You are my social class and honor.
You are unmoving - You never move at all. How can I be worried? ||1||
You alone are the One and only Lord;
You alone are the king.
By Your Grace, I have found peace. ||1||Pause||
You are the ocean, and I am Your swan; the pearls and rubies are in You.
You give, and You do not hesitate for an instant; I receive, forever enraptured. ||2||
I am Your child, and You are my father; You place the milk in my mouth.
I play with You, and You caress me in every way. You are forever the ocean of excellence. ||3||
You are perfect, perfectly all-pervading; I am fulfilled with You as well.
I am merged, merged, merged and remain merged; O Nanak, I cannot describe it! ||4||6||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
Make your hands the cymbals, your eyes the tambourines, and your forehead the guitar you play.
Let the sweet flute music resound in your ears, and with your tongue, vibrate this song.
Move your mind like the rhythmic hand-motions; do the dance, and shake your ankle bracelets. ||1||
This is the rhythmic dance of the Lord.
The Merciful Audience, the Lord, sees all your make-up and decorations. ||1||Pause||
The whole earth is the stage, with the canopy of the sky overhead.
The wind is the director; people are born of water.
From the five elements, the puppet was created with its actions. ||2||
The sun and the moon are the two lamps which shine, with the four corners of the world placed between them.
The ten senses are the dancing girls, and the five passions are the chorus; they sit together within the one body.
They all put on their own shows, and speak in different languages. ||3||
In each and every home there is dancing, day and night; in each and every home, the bugles blow.
Some are made to dance, and some are whirled around; some come and some go, and some are reduced to dust.
Says Nanak, one who meets with the True Guru, does not have to dance the dance of reincarnation again. ||4||7||
