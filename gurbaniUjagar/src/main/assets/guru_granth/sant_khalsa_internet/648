This is how the Gurmukhs eliminate their self-conceit, and come to rule the whole world.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh understands, when the Lord casts His Glance of Grace. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Blessed and approved is the coming into the world, of those Gurmukhs who meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
O Nanak, they save their families, and they are honored in the Court of the Lord. ||2||
Pauree:
The Guru unites His Sikhs, the Gurmukhs, with the Lord.
The Guru keeps some of them with Himself, and engages others in His Service.
Those who cherish their Beloved in their conscious minds, the Guru blesses them with His Love.
The Guru loves all of His GurSikhs equally well, like friends, children and siblings.
So chant the Name of the Guru, the True Guru, everyone! Chanting the Name of the Guru, Guru, you shall be rejuvenated. ||14||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
O Nanak, the blind, ignorant fools do not remember the Naam, the Name of the Lord; they involve themselves in other activities.
They are bound and gagged at the door of the Messenger of Death; they are punished, and in the end, they rot away in manure. ||1||
Third Mehl:
O Nanak, those humble beings are true and approved, who serve their True Guru.
They remain absorbed in the Name of the Lord, and their comings and goings cease. ||2||
Pauree:
Gathering the wealth and property of Maya, brings only pain in the end.
Homes, mansions and adorned palaces will not go with anyone.
He may breed horses of various colors, but these will not be of any use to him.
O human, link your consciousness to the Lord's Name, and in the end, it shall be your companion and helper.
Servant Nanak meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; the Gurmukh is blessed with peace. ||15||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Without the karma of good actions, the Name is not obtained; it can be obtained only by perfect good karma.
O Nanak, if the Lord casts His Glance of Grace, then under Guru's Instruction, one is united in His Union. ||1||
First Mehl:
Some are cremated, and some are buried; some are eaten by dogs.
Some are thrown into water, while others are thrown into wells.
O Nanak, it is not known, where they go and into what they merge. ||2||
Pauree:
The food and clothes, and all the worldly possessions of those who are attuned to the Lord's Name are sacred.
All the homes, temples, palaces and way-stations are sacred, where the Gurmukhs, the selfless servants, the Sikhs and the renouncers of the world, go and take their rest.
All the horses, saddles and horse blankets are sacred, upon which the Gurmukhs, the Sikhs, the Holy and the Saints, mount and ride.
All the rituals and Dharmic practices and deeds are sacred, for those who utter the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, the True Name of the Lord.
Those Gurmukhs, those Sikhs, who have purity as their treasure, go to their Guru. ||16||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
O Nanak, forsaking the Name, he loses everything, in this world and the next.
Chanting, deep meditation and austere self-disciplined practices are all wasted; he is deceived by the love of duality.
He is bound and gagged at the door of the Messenger of Death. He is beaten, and receives terrible punishment. ||1||
