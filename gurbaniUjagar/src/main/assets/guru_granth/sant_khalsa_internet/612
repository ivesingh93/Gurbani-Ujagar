Listen, friends: I am a sacrifice to the dust of Your feet.
This mind is yours, O Siblings of Destiny. ||Pause||
I wash your feet, I massage and clean them; I give this mind to you.
Listen, friends: I have come to Your Sanctuary; teach me, that I might unite with God. ||2||
Do not be proud; seek His Sanctuary, and accept as good all that He does.
Listen, friends: dedicate your soul, body and your whole being to Him; thus you shall receive the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. ||3||
He has shown mercy to me, by the Grace of the Saints; the Lord's Name is sweet to me.
The Guru has shown mercy to servant Nanak; I see the casteless, immaculate Lord everywhere. ||4||1||12||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
God is the Lord and Master of millions of universes; He is the Giver of all beings.
He ever cherishes and cares for all beings, but the fool does not appreciate any of His virtues. ||1||
I do not know how to worship the Lord in adoration.
I can only repeat, "Lord, Lord, Guru, Guru".
O Dear Lord, I go by the name of the Lord's slave. ||Pause||
The Compassionate Lord is Merciful to the meek, the ocean of peace; He fills all hearts.
He sees, hears, and is always with me; but I am a fool, and I think that He is far away. ||2||
The Lord is limitless, but I can only describe Him within my limitations; what do I know, about what He is like?
I offer my prayer to my True Guru; I am so foolish - please, teach me! ||3||
I am just a fool, but millions of sinners just like me have been saved.
Those who have heard, and seen Guru Nanak, do not descend into the womb of reincarnation again. ||4||2||13||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
Those things, which caused me such anxiety, have all vanished.
Now, I sleep in peace and tranquility, and my mind is in a state of deep and profound peace; the inverted lotus of my heart has blossomed forth. ||1||
Behold, a wondrous miracle has happened!
That Lord and Master, whose wisdom is said to be unfathomable, has been enshrined within my heart, by the Guru. ||Pause||
The demons which tormented me so much, have themselves become terrified.
They pray: please, save us from your Lord Master; we seek your protection. ||2||
When the treasure of the Lord of the Universe is opened, those who are pre-destined, receive it.
The Guru has given me the one jewel, and my mind and body have become peaceful and tranquil. ||3||
The Guru has blessed me with the one drop of Ambrosial Nectar, and so I have become stable, unmoving and immortal - I shall not die.
The Lord blessed Guru Nanak with the treasure of devotional worship, and did not call him to account again. ||4||3||14||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
Those whose minds are attached to the lotus feet of the Lord - those humble beings are satisfied and fulfilled.
But those, within whose hearts the priceless virtue does not abide - those men remain thirsty and unsatisfied. ||1||
Worshipping the Lord in adoration, one becomes happy, and free of disease.
But one who forgets my Dear Lord - know him to be afflicted with tens of thousands of illnesses. ||Pause||
