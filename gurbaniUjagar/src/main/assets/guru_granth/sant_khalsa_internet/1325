Those who have terrible luck and bad fortune do not drink in the water which washes the dust of the feet of the Holy.
The burning fire of their desires is not extinguished; they are beaten and punished by the Righteous Judge of Dharma. ||6||
You may visit all the sacred shrines, observe fasts and sacred feasts, give generously in charity and waste away the body, melting it in the snow.
The weight of the Lord's Name is unweighable, according to the Guru's Teachings; nothing can equal its weight. ||7||
O God, You alone know Your Glorious Virtues. Servant Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary.
You are the Ocean of water, and I am Your fish. Please be kind, and keep me always with You. ||8||3||
Kalyaan, Fourth Mehl:
I worship and adore the Lord, the All-pervading Lord.
I surrender my mind and body, and place everything before Him; following the Guru's Teachings, spiritual wisdom is implanted within me. ||1||Pause||
God's Name is the tree, and His Glorious Virtues are the branches. Picking and gathering up the fruit, I worship Him.
The soul is divine; divine is the soul. Worship Him with love. ||1||
One of keen intellect and precise understanding is immaculate in all this world. In thoughtful consideration, he drinks in the sublime essence.
By Guru's Grace, the treasure is found; dedicate this mind to the True Guru. ||2||
Priceless and utterly sublime is the Diamond of the Lord. This Diamond pierces the diamond of the mind.
The mind becomes the jeweler, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad; it appraises the Diamond of the Lord. ||3||
Attaching oneself to the Society of the Saints, one is exalted and uplifted, as the palaas tree is absorbed by the peepal tree.
That mortal being is supreme among all people, who is perfumed by the fragrance of the Lord's Name. ||4||
One who continually acts in goodness and immaculate purity, sprouts green branches in great abundance.
The Guru has taught me that Dharmic faith is the flower, and spiritual wisdom is the fruit; this fragrance permeates the world. ||5||
The One, the Light of the One, abides within my mind; God, the One, is seen in all.
The One Lord, the Supreme Soul, is spread out everywhere; all place their heads beneath His Feet. ||6||
Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, people look like criminals with their noses cut off; bit by bit, their noses are cut off.
The faithless cynics are called egotistical; without the Name, their lives are cursed. ||7||
As long as the breath breathes through the mind deep within, hurry and seek God's Sanctuary.
Please shower Your Kind Mercy and take pity upon Nanak, that he may wash the feet of the Holy. ||8||4||
Kalyaan, Fourth Mehl:
O Lord, I wash the feet of the Holy.
May my sins be burnt away in an instant; O my Lord and Master, please bless me with Your Mercy. ||1||Pause||
The meek and humble beggars stand begging at Your Door. Please be generous and give to those who are yearning.
Save me, save me, O God - I have come to Your Sanctuary. Please implant the Guru's Teachings, and the Naam within me. ||1||
Sexual desire and anger are very powerful in the body-village; I rise up to fight the battle against them.
Please make me Your Own and save me; through the Perfect Guru, I drive them out. ||2||
The powerful fire of corruption is raging violently within; the Word of the Guru's Shabad is the ice water which cools and soothes.
