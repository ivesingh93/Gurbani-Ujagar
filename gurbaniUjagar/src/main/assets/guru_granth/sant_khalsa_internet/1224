Slave Nanak asks for the Blessed Vision of God. It is the Support of his mind and body. ||2||78||101||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Without the Name of the Lord, the soul is polluted.
The True Lord God has Himself administered the intoxicating drug of corruption, and led the mortal astray. ||1||Pause||
Wandering through millions of incarnations in countless ways, he does not find stability anywhere.
The faithless cynic does not intuitively meet with the Perfect True Guru; he continues coming and going in reincarnation. ||1||
Please save me, O All-powerful Lord God, O Great Giver; O God, You are Inaccessible and Infinite.
Slave Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary, to cross over the terrible world-ocean, and reach the other shore. ||2||79||102||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
To chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord is Sublime.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, meditate on the Transcendent Lord God; The taste of His essence is Ambrosial Nectar. ||1||Pause||
Meditating in remembrance on the One Unmoving, Eternal, Unchanging Lord God, the intoxication of Maya wears off.
One who is blessed with intuitive peace and poise, and the vibrations of the Unstruck Celestial Bani, never suffers again. ||1||
Even Brahma and his sons sing God's Praises; Sukdayv and Prahlaad sing His Praises as well.
Drinking in the fascinating Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord's sublime essence, Nanak meditates on the Amazing Lord. ||2||80||103||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
He commits many millions of sins.
Day and night, he does not get tired of them, and he never finds release. ||1||Pause||
He carries on his head a terrible, heavy load of sin and corruption.
In an instant, he is exposed. The Messenger of Death seizes him by his hair. ||1||
He is consigned to countless forms of reincarnation, into beasts, ghosts, camels and donkeys.
Vibrating and meditating on the Lord of the Universe in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O Nanak, you shall never be struck or harmed at all. ||2||81||104||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
He is so blind! He is eating loads of poison.
His eyes, ears and body are totally exhausted; he shall lose his breath in an instant. ||1||Pause||
Making the poor suffer, he fills his belly, but the wealth of Maya shall not go with him.
Committing sinful mistakes again and again, he regrets and repents, but he can never give them up. ||1||
The Messenger of Death comes to slaughter the slanderer; he beats him on his head.
O Nanak, he cuts himself with his own dagger, and damages his own mind. ||2||82||105||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
The slanderer is destroyed in mid-stream.
Our Lord and Master is the Saving Grace, the Protector of His humble servants; those who have turned their backs on the Guru are overtaken by death. ||1||Pause||
No one listens to what he says; he is not allowed to sit anywhere.
He suffers in pain here, and falls into hell hereafter. He wanders in endless reincarnations. ||1||
He has become infamous across worlds and galaxies; he receives according to what he has done.
Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Fearless Creator Lord; he sings His Glorious Praises in ecstasy and bliss. ||2||83||106||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Desire plays itself out in so many ways.
