Bhairao, The Word Of Ravi Daas Jee, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Without seeing something, the yearning for it does not arise.
Whatever is seen, shall pass away.
Whoever chants and praises the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
is the true Yogi, free of desire. ||1||
When someone utters the Name of the Lord with love,
it is as if he has touched the philosopher's stone; his sense of duality is eradicated. ||1||Pause||
He alone is a silent sage, who destroys the duality of his mind.
Keeping the doors of his body closed, he merges in the Lord of the three worlds.
Everyone acts according to the inclinations of the mind.
Attuned to the Creator Lord, one remains free of fear. ||2||
Plants blossom forth to produce fruit.
When the fruit is produced, the flowers wither away.
For the sake of spiritual wisdom, people act and practice rituals.
When spiritual wisdom wells up, then actions are left behind. ||3||
For the sake of ghee, wise people churn milk.
Those who are Jivan-mukta, liberated while yet alive - are forever in the state of Nirvaanaa.
Says Ravi Daas, O you unfortunate people,
why not meditate on the Lord with love in your heart? ||4||1||
Naam Dayv:
Come, O Lord of beautiful hair,
wearing the robes of a Sufi Saint. ||Pause||
Your cap is the realm of the Akaashic ethers; the seven nether worlds are Your sandals.
The body covered with skin is Your temple; You are so beautiful, O Lord of the World. ||1||
The fifty-six million clouds are Your gowns, the 16,000 milkmaids are your skirts.
The eighteen loads of vegetation is Your stick, and all the world is Your plate. ||2||
The human body is the mosque, and the mind is the pirEst, who peacefully leads the prayer.
You are married to Maya, O Formless Lord, and so You have taken form. ||3||
Performing devotional worship services to You, my cymbals were taken away; unto whom should I complain?
Naam Dayv's Lord and Master, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, wanders everywhere; He has no specific home. ||4||1||
