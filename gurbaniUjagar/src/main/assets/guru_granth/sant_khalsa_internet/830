You have saved so many devotees, so many humble servants; so many silent sages contemplate You.
The support of the blind, the wealth of the poor; Nanak has found God, of endless virtues. ||2||2||127||
Raag Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl, Thirteenth House, Partaal:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O Enticing Lord, I cannot sleep; I sigh. I am adorned with necklaces, gowns, ornaments and make-up.
I am sad, sad and depressed.
When will You come home? ||1||Pause||
I seek the Sanctuary of the happy soul-brides; I place my head upon their feet.
Unite me with my Beloved.
When will He come to my home? ||1||
Listen, my companions: tell me how to meet Him. Eradicate all egotism, and then you shall find your Beloved Lord within the home of your heart.
Then, in delight, you shall sing the songs of joy and praise.
Meditate on the Lord, the embodiment of bliss.
O Nanak, I came to the Lord's Door,
and then, I found my Beloved. ||2||
The Enticing Lord has revealed His form to me,
and now, sleep seems sweet to me.
My thirst is totally quenched,
and now, I am absorbed in celestial bliss.
How sweet is the story of my Husband Lord.
I have found my Beloved, Enticing Lord. ||Second Pause||1||128||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
My ego is gone; I have obtained the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan.
I am absorbed in my Lord and Master, the help and support of the Saints.
Now, I hold tight to His Feet. ||1||Pause||
My mind longs for Him, and does not love any other. I am totally absorbed, in love with His Lotus Feet, like the bumble bee attached to the honey of the lotus flower.
I do not desire any other taste; I seek only the One Lord. ||1||
I have broken away from the others, and I have been released from the Messenger of Death.
O mind, drink in the subtle essence of the Lord; join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and turn away from the world.
There is no other, none other than the Lord.
O Nanak, love the Feet, the Feet of the Lord. ||2||2||129||
Raag Bilaaval, Ninth Mehl, Du-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The Name of the Lord is the Dispeller of sorrow - realize this.
Remembering Him in meditation, even Ajaamal the robber and Ganikaa the prostitute were liberated; let your soul know this. ||1||Pause||
The elephant's fear was taken away in an instant, as soon as he chanted the Lord's Name.
Listening to Naarad's teachings, the child Dhroo was absorbed in deep meditation. ||1||
He obtained the immovable, eternal state of fearlessness, and all the world was amazed.
Says Nanak, the Lord is the Saving Grace and the Protector of His devotees; believe it - He is close to you. ||2||1||
Bilaaval, Ninth Mehl:
Without the Name of the Lord, you shall only find pain.
Without devotional worship, doubt is not dispelled; the Guru has revealed this secret. ||1||Pause||
Of what use are sacred shrines of pilgrimage, if one does not enter the Sanctuary of the Lord?
