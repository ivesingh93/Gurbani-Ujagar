The 8.4 million species of beings all yearn for the Lord. Those whom He unites, come to be united with the Lord.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh finds the Lord, and remains forever absorbed in the Lord's Name. ||4||6||39||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
The Name of the Lord is the Ocean of Peace; the Gurmukhs obtain it.
Meditating on the Naam, night and day, they are easily and intuitively absorbed in the Naam.
Their inner beings are immersed in the True Lord; they sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, the world is in misery, engrossed in the love of duality.
In the Sanctuary of the Guru, peace is found, meditating on the Naam night and day. ||1||Pause||
The truthful ones are not stained by filth. Meditating on the Lord, their minds remain pure.
The Gurmukhs realize the Word of the Shabad; they are immersed in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord's Name.
The Guru has lit the brilliant light of spiritual wisdom, and the darkness of ignorance has been dispelled. ||2||
The self-willed manmukhs are polluted. They are filled with the pollution of egotism, wickedness and desire.
Without the Shabad, this pollution is not washed off; through the cycle of death and rebirth, they waste away in misery.
Engrossed in this transitory drama, they are not at home in either this world or the next. ||3||
For the Gurmukh, the love of the Name of the Lord is chanting, deep meditation and self-discipline.
The Gurmukh meditates forever on the Name of the One Creator Lord.
O Nanak, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the Support of all beings. ||4||7||40||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
The self-willed manmukhs are engrossed in emotional attachment; they are not balanced or detached.
They do not comprehend the Word of the Shabad. They suffer in pain forever, and lose their honor in the Court of the Lord.
The Gurmukhs shed their ego; attuned to the Naam, they find peace. ||1||
O my mind, day and night, you are always full of wishful hopes.
Serve the True Guru, and your emotional attachment shall be totally burnt away; remain detached within the home of your heart. ||1||Pause||
The Gurmukhs do good deeds and blossom forth; balanced and detached in the Lord, they are in ecstasy.
Night and day, they perform devotional worship, day and night; subduing their ego, they are carefree.
By great good fortune, I found the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation; I have found the Lord, with intuitive ease and ecstasy. ||2||
That person is a Holy Saadhu, and a renouncer of the world, whose heart is filled with the Naam.
His inner being is not touched by anger or dark energies at all; he has lost his selfishness and conceit.
The True Guru has revealed to him the Treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord; he drinks in the Sublime Essence of the Lord, and is satisfied. ||3||
Whoever has found it, has done so in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. Through perfect good fortune, such balanced detachment is attained.
The self-willed manmukhs wander around lost, but they do not know the True Guru. They are inwardly attached to egotism.
O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Shabad are dyed in the Color of the Lord's Name. Without the Fear of God, how can they retain this Color? ||4||8||41||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Within the home of your own inner being, the merchandise is obtained. All commodities are within.
Each and every moment, dwell on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; the Gurmukhs obtain it.
The Treasure of the Naam is inexhaustible. By great good fortune, it is obtained. ||1||
O my mind, give up slander, egotism and arrogance.
