Pauree:
Praise the Lord, forever and ever; dedicate your body and mind to Him.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I have found the True, Profound and Unfathomable Lord.
The Lord, the jewel of jewels, is permeating my mind, body and heart.
The pains of birth and death are gone, and I shall never again be consigned to the cycle of reincarnation.
O Nanak, praise the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the ocean of excellence. ||10||
Shalok, First Mehl:
O Nanak, burn this body; this burnt body has forgotten the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
The dirt is piling up, and in the world hereafter, your hand shall not be able to reach down into this stagnant pond to clean it out. ||1||
First Mehl:
O Nanak, wicked are the uncountable actions of the mind.
They bring terrible and painful retributions, but if the Lord forgives me, then I will be spared this punishment. ||2||
Pauree:
True is the Command He sends forth, and True are the Orders He issues.
Forever unmoving and unchanging, permeating and pervading everywhere, He is the All-knowing Primal Lord.
By Guru's Grace, serve Him, through the True Insignia of the Shabad.
That which He makes is perfect; through the Guru's Teachings, enjoy His Love.
He is inaccessible, unfathomable and unseen; as Gurmukh, know the Lord. ||11||
Shalok, First Mehl:
O Nanak, the bags of coins are brought in
and placed in the Court of our Lord and Master, and there, the genuine and the counterfeit are separated. ||1||
First Mehl:
They go and bathe at sacred shrines of pilgrimage, but their minds are still evil, and their bodies are thieves.
Some of their filth is washed off by these baths, but they only accumulate twice as much.
Like a gourd, they may be washed off on the outside, but on the inside, they are still filled with poison.
The holy man is blessed, even without such bathing, while a thief is a thief, no matter how much he bathes. ||2||
Pauree:
He Himself issues His Commands, and links the people of the world to their tasks.
He Himself joins some to Himself, and through the Guru, they find peace.
The mind runs around in the ten directions; the Guru holds it still.
Everyone longs for the Name, but it is only found through the Guru's Teachings.
Your pre-ordained destiny, written by the Lord in the very beginning, cannot be erased. ||12||
Shalok, First Mehl:
The two lamps light the fourteen markets.
There are just as many traders as there are living beings.
The shops are open, and trading is going on;
whoever comes there, is bound to depart.
The Righteous Judge of Dharma is the broker, who gives his sign of approval.
O Nanak, those who earn the profit of the Naam are accepted and approved.
And when they return home, they are greeted with cheers;
they obtain the glorious greatness of the True Name. ||1||
First Mehl:
Even when the night is dark, whatever is white retains its white color.
And even when the light of day is dazzlingly bright, whatever is black retains its black color.
The blind fools have no wisdom at all; their understanding is blind.
O Nanak, without the Lord's Grace, they will never receive honor. ||2||
Pauree:
The True Lord Himself created the body-fortress.
Some are ruined through the love of duality, engrossed in egotism.
This human body is so difficult to obtain; the self-willed manmukhs suffer in pain.
He alone understands, whom the Lord Himself causes to understand; he is blessed by the True Guru.
He created the entire world for His play; He is pervading amongst all. ||13||
