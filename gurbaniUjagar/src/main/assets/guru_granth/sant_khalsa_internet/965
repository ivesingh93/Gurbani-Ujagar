He conquers his soul, following the Guru's Teachings, and attains the Imperishable Lord.
He alone keeps up in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, who meditates on the Supreme Lord God.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, he is immaculate, as if he has bathed at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage.
He alone is a man of good fortune, who has met with God.
Nanak is a sacrifice to such a one, whose destiny is so great! ||17||
Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
When the Husband Lord is within the heart, then Maya, the bride, goes outside.
When one's Husband Lord is outside of oneself, then Maya, the bride, is supreme.
Without the Name, one wanders all around.
The True Guru shows us that the Lord is with us.
Servant Nanak merges in the Truest of the True. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
Making all sorts of efforts, they wander around; but they do not make even one effort.
O Nanak, how rare are those who understand the effort which saves the world. ||2||
Pauree:
The greatest of the great, infinite is Your dignity.
Your colors and hues are so numerous; no one can know Your actions.
You are the Soul within all souls; You alone know everything.
Everything is under Your control; Your home is beautiful.
Your home is filled with bliss, which resonates and resounds throughout Your home.
Your honor, majesty and glory are Yours alone.
You are overflowing with all powers; wherever we look, there You are.
Nanak, the slave of Your slaves, prays to You alone. ||18||
Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
Your streets are covered with canopies; under them, the traders look beautiful.
O Nanak, he alone is truly a banker, who buys the infinite commodity. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
Kabeer, no one is mine, and I belong to no one.
I am absorbed in the One, who created this creation. ||2||
Pauree:
The Lord is the most beautiful fruit tree, bearing fruits of Ambrosial Nectar.
My mind longs to meet Him; how can I ever find Him?
He has no color or form; He is inaccessible and unconquerable.
I love Him with all my soul; He opens the door for me.
I shall serve you forever, if you tell me of my Friend.
I am a sacrifice, a dedicated, devoted sacrifice to Him.
The Beloved Saints tell us, to listen with our consciousness.
One who has such pre-ordained destiny, O slave Nanak, is blessed with the Ambrosial Name by the True Guru. ||19||
Shalok, Fifth Mehl:
Kabeer, the earth belongs to the Holy, but the thieves have come and now sit among them.
The earth does not feel their weight; even they profit. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
Kabeer, for the sake of the rice, the husks are beaten and threshed.
When one sits in the company of evil people, then he will be called to account by the Righteous Judge of Dharma. ||2||
Pauree:
He Himself has the greatest family; He Himself is all alone.
He alone knows His own worth.
He Himself, by Himself, created everything.
Only He Himself can describe His own creation.
Blessed is Your place, where You dwell, Lord.
