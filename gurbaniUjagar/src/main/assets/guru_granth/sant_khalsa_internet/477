those who know Tantras and mantras and all medicines - even they shall die in the end. ||2||
Those who enjoy regal power and rule, royal canopies and thrones, many beautiful women,
betel nuts, camphor and fragrant sandalwood oil - in the end, they too shall die. ||3||
I have searched all the Vedas, Puraanas and Simritees, but none of these can save anyone.
Says Kabeer, meditate on the Lord, and eliminate birth and death. ||4||5||
Aasaa:
The elephant is the guitar player, the ox is the drummer, and the crow plays the cymbals.
Putting on the skirt, the donkey dances around, and the water buffalo performs devotional worship. ||1||
The Lord, the King, has cooked the cakes of ice,
but only the rare man of understanding eats them. ||1||Pause||
Sitting in his den, the lion prepares the betel leaves, and the muskrat brings the betel nuts.
Going from house to house, the mouse sings the songs of joy, and the turtle blows on the conch-shell. ||2||
The son of the sterile woman goes to get married, and the golden canopy is spread out for him.
He marries a beautiful and enticing young woman; the rabbit and the lion sing their praises. ||3||
Says Kabeer, listen, O Saints - the ant has eaten the mountain.
The turtle says, "I need a burning coal, also". Listen to this mystery of the Shabad. ||4||6||
Aasaa:
The body is a bag with seventy-two chambers, and one opening, the Tenth Gate.
He alone is a real Yogi on this earth, who asks for the primal world of the nine regions. ||1||
Such a Yogi obtains the nine treasures.
He lifts his soul up from below, to the skies of the Tenth Gate. ||1||Pause||
He makes spiritual wisdom his patched coat, and meditation his needle. He twists the thread of the Word of the Shabad.
Making the five elements his deer skin to sit on, he walks on the Guru's Path. ||2||
He makes compassion his shovel, his body the firewood, and he kindles the fire of divine vision.
He places love within his heart, and he remains in deep meditation throughout the four ages. ||3||
All Yoga is in the Name of the Lord; the body and the breath of life belong to Him.
Says Kabeer, if God grants His Grace, He bestows the insignia of Truth. ||4||7||
Aasaa:
Where have the Hindus and Muslims come from? Who put them on their different paths?
Think of this, and contemplate it within your mind, O men of evil intentions. Who will go to heaven and hell? ||1||
O Qazi, which book have you read?
Such scholars and students have all died, and none of them have discovered the inner meaning. ||1||Pause||
Because of the love of woman, circumcision is done; I don't believe in it, O Siblings of Destiny.
If God wished me to be a Muslim, it would be cut off by itself. ||2||
If circumcision makes one a Muslim, then what about a woman?
She is the other half of a man's body, and she does not leave him, so he remains a Hindu. ||3||
Give up your holy books, and remember the Lord, you fool, and stop oppressing others so badly.
Kabeer has grasped hold of the Lord's Support, and the Muslims have utterly failed. ||4||8||
Aasaa:
As long as the oil and the wick are in the lamp, everything is illuminated.
