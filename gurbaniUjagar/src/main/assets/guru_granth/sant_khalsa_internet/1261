The lifestyle of the Lord's humble servant is exalted and sublime. He spreads the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises throughout the world. ||3||
O my Lord and Master, please be merciful, merciful to me, that I may enshrine the Lord, Har, Har, Har, within my heart.
Nanak has found the Perfect True Guru; in his mind, he chants the Name of the Lord. ||4||9||
Malaar, Third Mehl, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Is this mind a householder, or is this mind a detached renunciate?
Is this mind beyond social class, eternal and unchanging?
Is this mind fickle, or is this mind detached?
How has this mind been gripped by possessiveness? ||1||
O Pandit, O religious scholar, reflect on this in your mind.
Why do you read so many other things, and carry such a heavy load? ||1||Pause||
The Creator has attached it to Maya and possessiveness.
Enforcing His Order, He created the world.
By Guru's Grace, understand this, O Siblings of Destiny.
Remain forever in the Sanctuary of the Lord. ||2||
He alone is a Pandit, who sheds the load of the three qualities.
Night and day, he chants the Name of the One Lord.
He accepts the Teachings of the True Guru.
He offers his head to the True Guru.
He remains forever unattached in the state of Nirvaanaa.
Such a Pandit is accepted in the Court of the Lord. ||3||
He preaches that the One Lord is within all beings.
As he sees the One Lord, he knows the One Lord.
That person, whom the Lord forgives, is united with Him.
He finds eternal peace, here and hereafter. ||4||
Says Nanak, what can anyone do?
He alone is liberated, whom the Lord blesses with His Grace.
Night and day, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
Then, he no longer bothers with the proclamations of the Shaastras or the Vedas. ||5||1||10||
Malaar, Third Mehl:
The self-willed manmukhs wander lost in reincarnation, confused and deluded by doubt.
The Messenger of Death constantly beats them and disgraces them.
Serving the True Guru, the mortal's subservience to Death is ended.
He meets the Lord God, and enters the Mansion of His Presence. ||1||
O mortal, as Gurmukh, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
In duality, you are ruining and wasting this priceless human life. You trade it away in exchange for a shell. ||1||Pause||
The Gurmukh falls in love with the Lord, by His Grace.
He enshrines loving devotion to the Lord, Har, Har, deep within his heart.
The Word of the Shabad carries him across the terrifying world-ocean.
He appears true in the True Court of the Lord. ||2||
Performing all sorts of rituals, they do not find the True Guru.
Without the Guru, so many wander lost and confused in Maya.
Egotism, possessiveness and attachment rise up and increase within them.
In the love of duality, the self-willed manmukhs suffer in pain. ||3||
The Creator Himself is Inaccessible and Infinite.
Chant the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and earn the true profit.
The Lord is Independent, Ever-present, here and now.
