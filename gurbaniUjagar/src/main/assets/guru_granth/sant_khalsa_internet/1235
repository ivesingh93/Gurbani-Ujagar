The self-willed manmukhs wander, lost in doubt and duality. They do not know how to contemplate the Lord. ||7||
He Himself is the Gurmukh, and He Himself gives; He Himself creates and beholds.
O Nanak, those humble beings are approved, whose honor the Lord Himself accepts. ||8||3||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl, Ashtapadees, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
O Lord of the World, I gaze upon Your wondrous glory.
You are the Doer, the Cause of causes, the Creator and Destroyer. You are the Sovereign Lord of all. ||1||Pause||
The rulers and nobles and kings shall become beggars. Their ostentatious shows are false
. My Sovereign Lord King is eternally stable. His Praises are sung in every heart. ||1||
Listen to the Praises of my Lord King, O Saints. I chant them as best I can.
My Lord King, the Great Giver, is Immeasurable. He is the Highest of the high. ||2||
He has strung His Breath throughout the creation; He locked the fire in the wood.
He placed the water and the land together, but neither blends with the other. ||3||
In each and every heart, the Story of our Sovereign Lord is told; in each and every home, they yearn for Him.
Afterwards, He created all beings and creatures; but first, He provided them with sustenance. ||4||
Whatever He does, He does by Himself. Who has ever given Him advice?
The mortals make all sorts of efforts and showy displays, but He is realized only through the Teachings of Truth. ||5||
The Lord protects and saves His devotees; He blesses them with the glory of His Name.
Whoever is disrespectful to the humble servant of the Lord, shall be swept away and destroyed. ||6||
Those who join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, are liberated; all their demerits are taken away.
Seeing them, God becomes merciful; they are carried across the terrifying world-ocean. ||7||
I am lowly, I am nothing at all; You are my Great Lord and Master - how can I even contemplate Your creative potency?
My mind and body are cooled and soothed, gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan. Nanak takes the Support of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||8||1||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl, Ashtapadees, Sixth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Listen to the Story of the Inaccessible and Unfathomable.
The glory of the Supreme Lord God is wondrous and amazing! ||1||Pause||
Forever and ever, humbly bow to the True Guru.
By Guru's Grace, sing the Glorious Praises of the Infinite Lord.
His Light shall radiate deep within your mind.
With the healing ointment of spiritual wisdom, ignorance is dispelled. ||1||
There is no limit to His Expanse.
His Glory is Infinite and Endless.
His many plays cannot be counted.
He is not subject to pleasure or pain. ||2||
Many Brahmas vibrate Him in the Vedas.
Many Shivas sit in deep meditation.
