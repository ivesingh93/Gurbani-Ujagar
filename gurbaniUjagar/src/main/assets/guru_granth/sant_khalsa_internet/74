I heard of the Guru, and so I went to Him.
He instilled within me the Naam, the goodness of charity and true cleansing.
All the world is liberated, O Nanak, by embarking upon the Boat of Truth. ||11||
The whole Universe serves You, day and night.
Please hear my prayer, O Dear Lord.
I have thoroughly tested and seen all-You alone, by Your Pleasure, can save us. ||12||
Now, the Merciful Lord has issued His Command.
Let no one chase after and attack anyone else.
Let all abide in peace, under this Benevolent RÃ¼le. ||13||
Softly and gently, drop by drop, the Ambrosial Nectar trickles down.
I speak as my Lord and Master causes me to speak.
I place all my faith in You; please accept me. ||14||
Your devotees are forever hungry for You.
O Lord, please fulfill my desires.
Grant me the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, O Giver of Peace. Please, take me into Your Embrace. ||15||
I have not found any other as Great as You.
You pervade the continents, the worlds and the nether regions;
You are permeating all places and interspaces. Nanak: You are the True Support of Your devotees. ||16||
I am a wrestler; I belong to the Lord of the World.
I met with the Guru, and I have tied a tall, plumed turban.
All have gathered to watch the wrestling match, and the Merciful Lord Himself is seated to behold it. ||17||
The bugles play and the drums beat.
The wrestlers enter the arena and circle around.
I have thrown the five challengers to the ground, and the Guru has patted me on the back. ||18||
All have gathered together,
but we shall return home by different routes.
The Gurmukhs reap their profits and leave, while the self-willed manmukhs lose their investment and depart. ||19||
You are without color or mark.
The Lord is seen to be manifest and present.
Hearing of Your Glories again and again, Your devotees meditate on You; they are attuned to You, O Lord, Treasure of Excellence. ||20||
Through age after age, I am the servant of the Merciful Lord.
The Guru has cut away my bonds.
I shall not have to dance in the wrestling arena of life again. Nanak has searched, and found this opportunity. ||21||2||29||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Siree Raag, First Mehl, Pehray, First House:
In the first watch of the night, O my merchant friend, you were cast into the womb, by the Lord's Command.
Upside-down, within the womb, you performed penance, O my merchant friend, and you prayed to your Lord and Master.
You uttered prayers to your Lord and Master, while upside-down, and you meditated on Him with deep love and affection.
You came into this Dark Age of Kali Yuga naked, and you shall depart again naked.
As God's Pen has written on your forehead, so it shall be with your soul.
Says Nanak, in the first watch of the night, by the Hukam of the Lord's Command, you enter into the womb. ||1||
