O people, O Siblings of Destiny, do not wander deluded by doubt.
The Creation is in the Creator, and the Creator is in the Creation, totally pervading and permeating all places. ||1||Pause||
The clay is the same, but the Fashioner has fashioned it in various ways.
There is nothing wrong with the pot of clay - there is nothing wrong with the Potter. ||2||
The One True Lord abides in all; by His making, everything is made.
Whoever realizes the Hukam of His Command, knows the One Lord. He alone is said to be the Lord's slave. ||3||
The Lord Allah is Unseen; He cannot be seen. The Guru has blessed me with this sweet molasses.
Says Kabeer, my anxiety and fear have been taken away; I see the Immaculate Lord pervading everywhere. ||4||3||
Prabhaatee:
Do not say that the Vedas, the Bible and the Koran are false. Those who do not contemplate them are false.
You say that the One Lord is in all, so why do you kill chickens? ||1||
O Mullah, tell me: is this God's Justice?
The doubts of your mind have not been dispelled. ||1||Pause||
You seize a living creature, and then bring it home and kill its body; you have killed only the clay.
The light of the soul passes into another form. So tell me, what have you killed? ||2||
And what good are your purifications? Why do you bother to wash your face? And why do you bother to bow your head in the mosque?
Your heart is full of hypocrisy; what good are your prayers or your pilgrimage to Mecca? ||3||
You are impure; you do not understand the Pure Lord. You do not know His Mystery.
Says Kabeer, you have missed out on paradise; your mind is set on hell. ||4||4||
Prabhaatee:
Hear my prayer, Lord; You are the Divine Light of the Divine, the Primal, All-pervading Master.
The Siddhas in Samaadhi have not found Your limits. They hold tight to the Protection of Your Sanctuary. ||1||
Worship and adoration of the Pure, Primal Lord comes by worshipping the True Guru, O Siblings of Destiny.
Standing at His Door, Brahma studies the Vedas, but he cannot see the Unseen Lord. ||1||Pause||
With the oil of knowledge about the essence of reality, and the wick of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, this lamp illuminates my body.
I have applied the Light of the Lord of the Universe, and lit this lamp. God the Knower knows. ||2||
The Unstruck Melody of the Panch Shabad, the Five Primal Sounds, vibrates and resounds. I dwell with the Lord of the World.
Kabeer, Your slave, performs this Aartee, this lamp-lit worship service for You, O Formless Lord of Nirvaanaa. ||3||5||
Prabhaatee, The Word Of Devotee Naam Dayv Jee:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The mind alone knows the state of the mind; I tell it to the Knowing Lord.
I chant the Name of the Lord, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts - why should I be afraid? ||1||
My mind is pierced through by the love of the Lord of the World.
My God is All-pervading everywhere. ||1||Pause||
The mind is the shop, the mind is the town, and the mind is the shopkeeper.
The mind abides in various forms, wandering all across the world. ||2||
This mind is imbued with the Word of the Guru's Shabad, and duality is easily overcome.
