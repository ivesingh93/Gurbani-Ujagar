They are filled and fulfilled with the Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord, the Treasure of sublime wealth;
O Nanak, the unstruck celestial melody vibrates for them. ||36||
Shalok:
The Guru, the Supreme Lord God, preserved my honor, when I renounced hypocrisy, emotional attachment and corruption.
O Nanak, worship and adore the One, who has no end or limitation. ||1||
Pauree:
PAPPA: He is beyond estimation; His limits cannot be found.
The Sovereign Lord King is inaccessible;
He is the Purifier of sinners. Millions of sinners are purified;
they meet the Holy, and chant the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Deception, fraud and emotional attachment are eliminated,
by those who are protected by the Lord of the World.
He is the Supreme King, with the royal canopy above His Head.
O Nanak, there is no other at all. ||37||
Shalok:
The noose of Death is cut, and one's wanderings cease; victory is obtained, when one conquers his own mind.
O Nanak, eternal stability is obtained from the Guru, and one's day-to-day wanderings cease. ||1||
Pauree:
FAFFA: After wandering and wandering for so long, you have come;
in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, you have obtained this human body, so very difficult to obtain.
This opportunity shall not come into your hands again.
So chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and the noose of Death shall be cut away.
You shall not have to come and go in reincarnation over and over again,
if you chant and meditate on the One and Only Lord.
Shower Your Mercy, O God, Creator Lord,
and unite poor Nanak with Yourself. ||38||
Shalok:
Hear my prayer, O Supreme Lord God, Merciful to the meek, Lord of the World.
The dust of the feet of the Holy is peace, wealth, great enjoyment and pleasure for Nanak. ||1||
Pauree:
BABBA: One who knows God is a Brahmin.
A Vaishnaav is one who, as Gurmukh, lives the righteous life of Dharma.
One who eradicates his own evil is a brave warrior;
no evil even approaches him.
Man is bound by the chains of his own egotism, selfishness and conceit.
The spiritually blind place the blame on others.
But all debates and clever tricks are of no use at all.
O Nanak, he alone comes to know, whom the Lord inspires to know. ||39||
Shalok:
The Destroyer of fear, the Eradicator of sin and sorrow - enshrine that Lord in your mind.
One whose heart abides in the Society of the Saints, O Nanak, does not wander around in doubt. ||1||
Pauree:
BHABHA: Cast out your doubt and delusion -
this world is just a dream.
The angelic beings, goddesses and gods are deluded by doubt.
The Siddhas and seekers, and even Brahma are deluded by doubt.
Wandering around, deluded by doubt, people are ruined.
It is so very difficult and treacherous to cross over this ocean of Maya.
That Gurmukh who has eradicated doubt, fear and attachment,
O Nanak, obtains supreme peace. ||40||
Shalok:
Maya clings to the mind, and causes it to waver in so many ways.
When You, O Lord, restrain someone from asking for wealth, then, O Nanak, he comes to love the Name. ||1||
Pauree:
MAMMA: The beggar is so ignorant -
the Great Giver continues to give. He is All-knowing.
Whatever He gives, He gives once and for all.
O foolish mind, why do you complain, and cry out so loud?
Whenever you ask for something, you ask for worldly things;
no one has obtained happiness from these.
If you must ask for a gift, then ask for the One Lord.
O Nanak, by Him, you shall be saved. ||41||
