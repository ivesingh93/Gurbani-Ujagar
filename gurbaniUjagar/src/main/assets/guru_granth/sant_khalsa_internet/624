Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
The Perfect Guru has made me perfect.
God is totally pervading and permeating everywhere.
With joy and pleasure, I take my purifying bath.
I am a sacrifice to the Supreme Lord God. ||1||
I enshrine the lotus feet of the Guru within my heart.
Not even the tiniest obstacle blocks my way; all my affairs are resolved. ||1||Pause||
Meeting with the Holy Saints, my evil-mindedness was eradicated.
All the sinners are purified.
Bathing in the sacred pool of Guru Ram Das,
all the sins one has committed are washed away. ||2||
So sing forever the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe;
joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, meditate on Him.
The fruits of your mind's desires are obtained
by meditating on the Perfect Guru within your heart. ||3||
The Guru, the Lord of the World, is blissful;
chanting, meditating on the Lord of supreme bliss, He lives.
Servant Nanak meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
God has confirmed His innate nature. ||4||10||60||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
In the ten directions, the clouds cover the sky like a canopy; through the dark clouds, lightning flashes, and I am terrified.
By bed is empty, and my eyes are sleepless; my Husband Lord has gone far away. ||1||
Now, I receive no messages from Him, O mother!
When my Beloved used to go even a mile away, He would send me four letters. ||Pause||
How could I forget this Dear Beloved of mine? He is the Giver of peace, and all virtues.
Ascending to His Mansion, I gaze upon His path, and my eyes are filled with tears. ||2||
The wall of egotism and pride separates us, but I can hear Him nearby.
There is a veil between us, like the wings of a butterfly; without being able to see Him, He seems so far away. ||3||
The Lord and Master of all has become merciful; He has dispelled all my sufferings.
Says Nanak, when the Guru tore down the wall of egotism, then, I found my Merciful Lord and Master. ||4||
All my fears have been dispelled, O mother!
Whoever I seek, the Guru leads me to find.
The Lord, our King, is the treasure of all virtue. ||Second. Pause||11||61||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
The Restorer of what was taken away, the Liberator from captivity; the Formless Lord, the Destroyer of pain.
I do not know about karma and good deeds; I do not know about Dharma and righteous living. I am so greedy, chasing after Maya.
I go by the name of God's devotee; please, save this honor of Yours. ||1||
O Dear Lord, You are the honor of the dishonored.
You make the unworthy ones worthy, O my Lord of the Universe; I am a sacrifice to Your almighty creative power. ||Pause||
Like the child, innocently making thousands of mistakes -
his father teaches him, and scolds him so many times, but still, he hugs him close in his embrace.
Please forgive my past actions, God, and place me on Your path for the future. ||2||
The Lord, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, knows all about my state of mind; so who else should I go to and speak to?
The Lord, the Lord of the Universe, is not pleased by mere recitation of words; if it is pleasing to His Will, He preserves our honor.
I have seen all other shelters, but Yours alone remains for me. ||3||
