It is like oil to the lamp whose flame is dying out.
It is like water poured on the burning fire.
It is like milk poured into the baby's mouth. ||1||
As one's brother becomes a helper on the field of battle;
as one's hunger is satisfied by food;
as the cloudburst saves the crops;
as one is protected in the tiger's lair;||2||
As with the magic spell of Garuda the eagle upon one's lips, one does not fear the snake;
as the cat cannot eat the parrot in its cage;
as the bird cherishes her eggs in her heart;
as the grains are spared, by sticking to the central post of the mill;||3||
Your Glory is so great; I can describe only a tiny bit of it.
O Lord, You are inaccessible, unapproachable and unfathomable.
You are lofty and high, utterly great and infinite.
Meditating in remembrance on the Lord, O Nanak, one is carried across. ||4||3||
Maalee Gauraa, Fifth Mehl:
Please let my works be rewarding and fruitful.
Please cherish and exalt Your slave. ||1||Pause||
I lay my forehead on the feet of the Saints,
and with my eyes, I gaze upon the Blessed Vision of their Darshan, day and night.
With my hands, I work for the Saints.
I dedicate my breath of life, my mind and wealth to the Saints. ||1||
My mind loves the Society of the Saints.
The Virtues of the Saints abide within my consciousness.
The Will of the Saints is sweet to my mind.
Seeing the Saints, my heart-lotus blossoms forth. ||2||
I dwell in the Society of the Saints.
I have such a great thirst for the Saints.
The Words of the Saints are the Mantras of my mind.
By the Grace of the Saints, my corruption is taken away. ||3||
This way of liberation is my treasure.
O Merciful God, please bless me with this gift.
O God, shower Your Mercy upon Nanak.
I have enshrined the feet of the Saints within my heart. ||4||4||
Maalee Gauraa, Fifth Mehl:
He is with all; He is not far away.
He is the Cause of causes, ever-present here and now. ||1||Pause||
Hearing His Name, one comes to life.
Pain is dispelled; peace and tranquility come to dwell within.
The Lord, Har, Har, is all treasure.
The silent sages serve Him. ||1||
Everything is contained in His home.
No one is turned away empty-handed.
He cherishes all beings and creatures.
Forever and ever, serve the Merciful Lord. ||2||
Righteous justice is dispensed in His Court forever.
He is carefree, and owes allegiance to no one.
He Himself, by Himself, does everything.
O my mind, meditate on Him. ||3||
I am a sacrifice to the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
Joining them, I am saved.
My mind and body are attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
God has blessed Nanak with this gift. ||4||5||
Maalee Gauraa, Fifth Mehl, Du-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
I seek the Sanctuary of the all-powerful Lord.
My soul, body, wealth and capital belong to the One God, the Cause of causes. ||1||Pause||
Meditating, meditating in remembrance on Him, I have found everlasting peace. He is the source of life.
He is all-pervading, permeating all places; He is in subtle essence and manifest form. ||1||
