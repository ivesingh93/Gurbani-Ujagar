Says Nanak, I am every bit a sacrifice to those, within whose hearts my Lord God abides. ||3||
Shalok:
Those who long for the Lord, are said to be His servants.
Nanak knows this Truth, that the Lord is not different from His Saint. ||1||
Chhant:
As water mixes and blends with water,
so does one's light mix and blend with the Lord's Light.
Merging with the perfect, all-powerful Creator, one comes to know his own self.
Then, he enters the celestial state of absolute Samaadhi, and speaks of the One and Only Lord.
He Himself is unmanifest, and He Himself is liberated; He Himself speaks of Himself.
O Nanak, doubt, fear and the limitations of the three qualities are dispelled, as one merges into the Lord, like water blending with water. ||4||2||
Wadahans, Fifth Mehl:
God is the all-powerful Creator, the Cause of causes.
He preserves the whole world, reaching out with His hand.
He is the all-powerful, safe Sanctuary, Lord and Master, Treasure of mercy, Giver of peace.
I am a sacrifice to Your slaves, who recognize only the One Lord.
His color and shape cannot be seen; His description is indescribable.
Prays Nanak, hear my prayer, O God, Almighty Creator, Cause of causes. ||1||
These beings are Yours; You are their Creator.
God is the Destroyer of pain, suffering and doubt.
Eliminate my doubt, pain and suffering in an instant, and preserve me, O Lord, Merciful to the meek.
You are mother, father and friend, O Lord and Master; the whole world is Your child, O Lord of the World.
One who comes seeking Your Sanctuary, obtains the treasure of virtue, and does not have to enter the cycle of birth and death again.
Prays Nanak, I am Your slave. All beings are Yours; You are their Creator. ||2||
Meditating on the Lord, twenty-four hours a day,
the fruits of the heart's desires are obtained.
Your heart's desires are obtained, meditating on God, and the fear of death is dispelled.
I sing of the Lord of the Universe in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and my hopes are fulfilled.
Renouncing egotism, emotional attachment and all corruption, we become pleasing to the Mind of God.
Prays Nanak, day and night, meditate forever on the Lord, Har, Har. ||3||
At the Lord's Door, the unstruck melody resounds.
In each and every heart, the Lord, the Lord of the Universe, sings.
The Lord of the Universe sings, and abides forever; He is unfathomable, profoundly deep, lofty and exalted.
His virtues are infinite - none of them can be described. No one can reach Him.
He Himself creates, and He Himself sustains; all beings and creatures are fashioned by Him.
Prays Nanak, happiness comes from devotional worship of the Naam; at His Door, the unstruck melody resounds. ||4||3||
Raag Wadahans, First Mehl, Fifth House, Alaahanees ~ Songs Of Mourning:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Blessed is the Creator, the True King, who has linked the whole world to its tasks.
When one's time is up, and the measure is full, this dear soul is caught, and driven off.
