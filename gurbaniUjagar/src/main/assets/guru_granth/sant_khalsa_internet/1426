Those whom He saves, meditate in remembrance on the Creator Lord. ||15||
Forsake duality and the ways of evil; focus your consciousness on the One Lord.
In the love of duality, O Nanak, the mortals are being washed downstream. ||16||
In the markets and bazaars of the three qualities, the merchants make their deals.
Those who load the true merchandise are the true traders. ||17||
Those who do not know the way of love are foolish; they wander lost and confused.
O Nanak, forgetting the Lord, they fall into the deep, dark pit of hell. ||18||
In his mind, the mortal does not forget Maya; he begs for more and more wealth.
That God does not even come into his consciousness; O Nanak, it is not in his karma. ||19||
The mortal does not run out of capital, as long as the Lord Himself is merciful.
The Word of the Shabad is Guru Nanak's inexhaustible treasure; this wealth and capital never runs out, no matter how much it is spent and consumed. ||20||
If I could find wings for sale, I would buy them with an equal weight of my flesh.
I would attach them to my body, and seek out and find my Friend. ||21||
My Friend is the True Supreme King, the King over the heads of kings.
Sitting by His side, we are exalted and beautified; He is the Support of all. ||22||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Shalok, Ninth Mehl:
If you do not sing the Praises of the Lord, your life is rendered useless.
Says Nanak, meditate, vibrate upon the Lord; immerse your mind in Him, like the fish in the water. ||1||
Why are you engrossed in sin and corruption? You are not detached, even for a moment!
Says Nanak, meditate, vibrate upon the Lord, and you shall not be caught in the noose of death. ||2||
Your youth has passed away like this, and old age has overtaken your body.
Says Nanak, meditate, vibrate upon the Lord; your life is fleeting away! ||3||
You have become old, and you do not understand that death is overtaking you.
Says Nanak, you are insane! Why do you not remember and meditate on God? ||4||
Your wealth, spouse, and all the possessions which you claim as your own -
none of these shall go along with you in the end. O Nanak, know this as true. ||5||
He is the Saving Grace of sinners, the Destroyer of fear, the Master of the masterless.
Says Nanak, realize and know Him, who is always with you. ||6||
He has given you your body and wealth, but you are not in love with Him.
Says Nanak, you are insane! Why do you now shake and tremble so helplessly? ||7||
He has given you your body, wealth, property, peace and beautiful mansions.
Says Nanak, listen, mind: why don't you remember the Lord in meditation? ||8||
The Lord is the Giver of all peace and comfort. There is no other at all.
Says Nanak, listen, mind: meditating in remembrance on Him, salvation is attained. ||9||
