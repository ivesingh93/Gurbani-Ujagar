One who searches the village of the body, through the Shabad, obtains the nine treasures of the Naam. ||22||
Conquering desire, the mind is absorbed in intuitive ease, and then one chants the Lord's Praises without speaking. ||23||
Let your eyes gaze upon the Wondrous Lord; let your consciousness be attached to the Unseen Lord. ||24||
The Unseen Lord is forever absolute and immaculate; one's light merges into the Light. ||25||
I praise my Guru forever, who has inspired me to understand this true understanding. ||26||
Nanak offers this one prayer: through the Name, may I find salvation and honor. ||27||2||11||
Raamkalee, Third Mehl:
It is so hard to obtain that devotional worship of the Lord, O Saints. It cannot be described at all. ||1||
O Saints, as Gurmukh, find the Perfect Lord,
and worship the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Without the Lord, everything is filthy, O Saints; what offering should I place before Him? ||2||
Whatever pleases the True Lord is devotional worship; His Will abides in the mind. ||3||
Everyone worships Him, O Saints, but the self-willed manmukh is not accepted or approved. ||4||
If someone dies in the Word of the Shabad, his mind become immaculate, O Saints; such worship is accepted and approved. ||5||
Sanctified and pure are those true beings, who enshrine love for the Shabad. ||6||
There is no worship of the Lord, other than the Name; the world wanders, deluded by doubt. ||7||
The Gurmukh understands his own self, O Saints; he lovingly centers his mind on the Lord's Name. ||8||
The Immaculate Lord Himself inspires worship of Him; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, it is accepted and approved. ||9||
Those who worship Him, but do not know the Way, are polluted with the love of duality. ||10||
One who becomes Gurmukh, knows what worship is; the Lord's Will abides within his mind. ||11||
One who accepts the Lord's Will obtains total peace, O Saints; in the end, the Naam will be our help and support. ||12||
One who does not understand his own self, O Saints, falsely flatters himself. ||13||
The Messenger of Death does not give up on those who practices hypocrisy; they are dragged away in disgrace. ||14||
Those who have the Shabad deep within, understand themselves; they find the way of salvation. ||15||
Their minds enter into the deepest state of Samaadhi, and their light is absorbed into the Light. ||16||
The Gurmukhs listen constantly to the Naam, and chant it in the True Congregation. ||17||
The Gurmukhs sing the Lord's Praises, and erase self-conceit; they obtain true honor in the Court of the Lord. ||18||
True are their words; they speak only the Truth; they lovingly focus on the True Name. ||19||
My God is the Destroyer of fear, the Destroyer of sin; in the end, He is our only help and support. ||20||
He Himself pervades and permeates everything; O Nanak, glorious greatness is obtained through the Naam. ||21||3||12||
Raamkalee, Third Mehl:
I am filthy and polluted, proud and egotistical; receiving the Word of the Shabad, my filth is taken away. ||1||
O Saints, the Gurmukhs are saved through the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
The True Name abides deep within their hearts. The Creator Himself embellishes them. ||1||Pause||
