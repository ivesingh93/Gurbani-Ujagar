All have grown weary of wandering throughout the four ages, but none know the Lord's worth.
The True Guru has shown me the One Lord, and my mind and body are at peace.
The Gurmukh praises the Lord forever; that alone happens, which the Creator Lord does. ||7||
Shalok, Second Mehl:
Those who have the Fear of God, have no other fears; those who do not have the Fear of God, are very afraid.
O Nanak, this mystery is revealed at the Court of the Lord. ||1||
Second Mehl:
That which flows, mingles with that which flows; that which blows, mingles with that which blows.
The living mingle with the living, and the dead mingle with the dead.
O Nanak, praise the One who created the creation. ||2||
Pauree:
Those who meditate on the True Lord are true; they contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
They subdue their ego, purify their minds, and enshrine the Lord's Name within their hearts.
The fools are attached to their homes, mansions and balconies.
The self-willed manmukhs are caught in darkness; they do not know the One who created them.
He alone understands, whom the True Lord causes to understand; what can the helpless creatures do? ||8||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
O bride, decorate yourself, after you surrender and accept your Husband Lord.
Otherwise, your Husband Lord will not come to your bed, and your ornaments will be useless.
O bride, your decorations will adorn you, only when your Husband Lord's Mind is pleased.
Your ornaments will be acceptable and approved, only when your Husband Lord loves you.
So make the Fear of God your ornaments, joy your betel nuts to chew, and love your food.
Surrender your body and mind to your Husband Lord, and then, O Nanak, He will enjoy you. ||1||
Third Mehl:
The wife takes flowers, and fragrance of betel, and decorates herself.
But her Husband Lord does not come to her bed, and so these efforts are useless. ||2||
Third Mehl:
They are not said to be husband and wife, who merely sit together.
They alone are called husband and wife, who have one light in two bodies. ||3||
Pauree:
Without the Fear of God, there is no devotional worship, and no love for the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Meeting with the True Guru, the Fear of God wells up, and one is embellished with the Fear and the Love of God.
When the body and mind are imbued with the Lord's Love, egotism and desire are conquered and subdued.
The mind and body become immaculately pure and very beautiful, when one meets the Lord, the Destroyer of ego.
Fear and love all belong to Him; He is the True Lord, permeating and pervading the Universe. ||9||
Shalok, First Mehl:
Waaho! Waaho! You are wonderful and great, O Lord and Master; You created the creation, and made us.
You made the waters, waves, oceans, pools, plants, clouds and mountains.
You Yourself stand in the midst of what You Yourself created.
The selfless service of the Gurmukhs is approved; in celestial peace, they live the essence of reality.
They receive the wages of their labor, begging at the Door of their Lord and Master.
O Nanak, the Court of the Lord is overflowing and carefree; O my True Carefree Lord, no one returns empty-handed from Your Court. ||1||
First Mehl:
The teeth are like brilliant, beautiful pearls, and the eyes are like sparkling jewels.
Old age is their enemy, O Nanak; when they grow old, they waste away. ||2||
