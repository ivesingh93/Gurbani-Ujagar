O My True Lord Master, True is Your glorious greatness.
You are the Supreme Lord God, the Infinite Lord and Master. Your creative power cannot be described.
True is Your glorious greatness; when You enshrine it within the mind, one sings Your Glorious Praises forever.
He sings Your Glorious Praises, when it is pleasing to You, O True Lord; he centers his consciousness on You.
One whom You unite with Yourself, as Gurmukh, remains absorbed in You.
Thus says Nanak: O my True Lord Master, True is Your Glorious Greatness. ||10||2||7||5||2||7||
Raag Aasaa, Chhant, Fourth Mehl, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Life - I have found real life, as Gurmukh, through His Love.
The Lord's Name - He has given me the Lord's Name, and enshrined it within my breath of life.
He has enshrined the Name of the Lord, Har, Har within my breath of life, and all my doubts and sorrows have departed.
I have meditated on the invisible and unapproachable Lord, through the Guru's Word, and I have obtained the pure, supreme status.
The unstruck melody resounds, and the instruments ever vibrate, singing the Bani of the True Guru.
O Nanak, God the Great Giver has given me a gift; He has blended my light into the Light. ||1||
The self-willed manmukhs dIE in their self-willed stubbornness, declaring that the wealth of Maya is theirs.
They attach their consciousness to the foul-smelling pile of filth, which comes for a moment, and departs in an instant.
They attach their consciousness to the foul-smelling pile of filth, which is transitory, like the fading color of the safflower.
One moment, they are facing east, and the next instant, they are facing west; they continue spinning around, like the potter's wheel.
In sorrow, they eat, and in sorrow, they gather things and try to enjoy them, but they only increase their stores of sorrow.
O Nanak, one easily crosses over the terrifying world-ocean, when he comes to the Sanctuary of the Guru. ||2||
My Lord, my Lord Master is sublime, unapproachable and unfathomable.
The wealth of the Lord - I seek the wealth of the Lord, from my True Guru, the Divine Banker.
I seek the wealth of the Lord, to purchase the Naam; I sing and love the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
I have totally renounced sleep and hunger, and through deep meditation, I am absorbed into the Absolute Lord.
The traders of one kind come and take away the Name of the Lord as their profit.
O Nanak, dedicate your mind and body to the Guru; one who is so destined, attains it. ||3||
The great ocean is full of the treasures of jewels upon jewels.
Those who are committed to the Word of the Guru's Bani, see them come into their hands.
This priceless, incomparable jewel comes into the hands of those who are committed to the Word of the Guru's Bani.
They obtain the immeasurable Name of the Lord, Har, Har; their treasure is overflowing with devotional worship.
I have churned the ocean of the body, and I have seen the incomparable thing come into view.
The Guru is God, and God is the Guru, O Nanak; there is no difference between the two, O Siblings of Destiny. ||4||1||8||
Aasaa, Fourth Mehl:
Slowly, slowly, slowly, very slowly, the drops of Ambrosial Nectar trickle down.
