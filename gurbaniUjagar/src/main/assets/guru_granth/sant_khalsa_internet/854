My Lord and Master is on the side of servant Nanak. The All-powerful and All-knowing Lord God is my Best Friend.
Seeing the food being distributed, everyone came and fell at the feet of the True Guru, who cleansed the minds of all of their egotistical pride. ||10||
Shalok, First Mehl:
One plants the seed, another harvests the crop, and still another beats the grain from the chaff.
O Nanak, it is not known, who will ultimately eat the grain. ||1||
First Mehl:
He alone is carried across, within whose mind the Lord abides.
O Nanak, that alone happens, which is pleasing to His Will. ||2||
Pauree:
The Merciful Supreme Lord God has carried me across the world-ocean.
The compassionate perfect Guru has eradicated my doubts and fears.
Unsatisfied sexual desire and unresolved anger, the horrible demons, have been totally destroyed.
I have enshrined the treasure of the Ambrosial Naam within my throat and heart.
O Nanak, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, my birth and death have been adorned and redeemed. ||11||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Those who forget the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are said to be false.
The five thieves plunder their homes, and egotism breaks in.
The faithless cynics are defrauded by their own evil-mindedness; they do not know the sublime essence of the Lord.
Those who lose the Ambrosial Nectar through doubt, remain engrossed and entangled in corruption.
They make friends with the wicked, and argue with the humble servants of the Lord.
O Nanak, the faithless cynics are bound and gagged by the Messenger of Death, and suffer agony in hell.
They act according to the karma of the actions they committed before; as the Lord keeps them, so do they live. ||1||
Third Mehl:
Those who serve the True Guru, are transformed from powerless into powerful.
With every breath and morsel of food, the Lord abides in their minds forever, and the Messenger of Death cannot even see them.
The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, fills their hearts, and Maya is their servant.
One who becomes the slave of the Lord's slaves, obtains the greatest treasure.
O Nanak, I am forever a sacrifice to that one, within whose mind and body God dwells.
One who has such pre-ordained destiny, he alone is in love with the humble Saints. ||2||
Pauree:
Whatever the Perfect True Guru says, the Transcendent Lord hears.
It pervades and permeates the whole world, and it is on the mouth of each and every being.
So numerous are the great glories of the Lord, they cannot even be counted.
Truth, poise and bliss rest in the True Guru; the Guru bestows the jewel of Truth.
O Nanak, the Supreme Lord God embellishes the Saints, who become like the True Lord. ||12||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
He does not understand himself; he believes the Lord God to be far away.
He forgets to serve the Guru; how can his mind remain in the Lord's Presence?
The self-willed manmukh wastes away his life in worthless greed and falsehood.
O Nanak, the Lord forgives, and blends them with Himself; through the True Word of the Shabad, He is ever-present. ||1||
Third Mehl:
True is the Praise of the Lord God; the Gurmukh chants the Name of the Lord of the Universe.
Praising the Naam night and day, and meditating on the Lord, the mind becomes blissful.
By great good fortune, I have found the Lord, the perfect embodiment of supreme bliss.
Servant Nanak praises the Naam; his mind and body shall never again be shattered. ||2||
