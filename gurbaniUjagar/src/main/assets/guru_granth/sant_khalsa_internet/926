Prays Nanak, God has granted His Grace, and I have found the Perfect True Guru. ||2||
Meet with the holy, humble servants of God; meeting with the Lord, listen to the Kirtan of His Praises.
God is the Merciful Master, the Lord of wealth; there is no end to His Virtues.
The Merciful Lord is the Dispeller of pain, the Giver of Sanctuary, the Eradicator of all evil.
Emotional attachment, sorrow, corruption and pain - chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, one is saved from these.
All beings are Yours, O my God; bless me with Your Mercy, that I may become the dust under the feet of all men.
Prays Nanak, O God, be kind to me, that I may chant Your Name, and live. ||3||
God saves His humble devotees, attaching them to His feet.
Twenty-four hours a day, they meditate in remembrance on their God; they meditate on the One Name.
Meditating on that God, they cross over the terrifying world-ocean, and their comings and goings cease.
They enjoy eternal peace and pleasure, singing the Kirtan of God's Praises; His Will seems so sweet to them.
All my desires are fulfilled, meeting with the Perfect True Guru.
Prays Nanak, God has blended me with Himself; I shall never suffer pain or sorrow again. ||4||3||

In the Sanctuary of His lotus feet, I sing His Glorious Praises in ecstasy and bliss.
O Nanak, worship God in adoration, the Eradicator of misfortune. ||1||
Chhant:
God is the Eradicator of misfortune; there is none other than Him.
Forever and ever, remember the Lord in meditation; He is permeating the water, the land and the sky.
He is permeating and pervading the water, the land and the sky; do not forget Him from your mind, even for an instant.
Blessed was that day, when I grasped the Guru's feet; all virtues rest in the Lord of the Universe.
So serve Him day and night, O servant; whatever pleases Him, happens.
Nanak is a sacrifice to the Giver of peace; his mind and body are enlightened. ||1||

Meditating in remembrance on the Lord, the mind and body find peace; the thought of duality is dispelled.

The Merciful Lord has eradicated my fears and troubles.
In ecstasy, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord; God is the Cherisher, the Master of the meek.
The Cherishing Lord is imperishable, the One and only Primal Lord; I am imbued with His Love.
When I placed my hands and forehead upon His Feet, He blended me with Himself; I became awake and aware forever, night and day.
My soul, body, household and home belong to Him, along with my body, youth, wealth and property.
Forever and ever, Nanak is a sacrifice to Him, who cherishes and nurtures all beings. ||2||

My tongue chants the Name of the Lord, and chants the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe.
