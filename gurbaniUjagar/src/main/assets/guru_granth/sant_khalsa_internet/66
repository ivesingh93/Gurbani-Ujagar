Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
The soul-bird in the beautiful tree of the body pecks at Truth, with love for the Guru.
She drinks in the Sublime Essence of the Lord, and abides in intuitive ease; she does not fly around coming and going.
She obtains her home within her own heart; she is absorbed into the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||1||
O mind, work to serve the Guru.
If you walk in harmony with the Guru's Will, you shall remain immersed in the Lord's Name, night and day. ||1||Pause||
The birds in the beautiful trees fly around in all four directions.
The more they fly around, the more they suffer; they burn and cry out in pain.
Without the Guru, they do not find the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, and they do not obtain the Ambrosial Fruit. ||2||
The Gurmukh is like God's tree, always green, blessed with the Sublime Love of the True One, with intuitive peace and poise.
He cuts off the three branches of the three qualities, and embraces love for the One Word of the Shabad.
The Lord alone is the Ambrosial Fruit; He Himself gives it to us to eat. ||3||
The self-willed manmukhs stand there and dry up; they do not bear any fruit, and they do not provide any shade.
Don't even bother to sit near them-they have no home or village.
They are cut down and burnt each day; they have neither the Shabad, nor the Lord's Name. ||4||
According to the Lord's Command, people perform their actions; they wander around, driven by the karma of their past actions.
By the Lord's Command, they behold the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. Wherever He sends them, there they go.
By His Command, the Lord, Har, Har, abides within our minds; by His Command we merge in Truth. ||5||
The wretched fools do not know the Lord's Will; they wander around making mistakes.
They go about their business stubborn-mindedly; they are disgraced forever and ever.
Inner peace does not come to them; they do not embrace love for the True Lord. ||6||
Beautiful are the faces of the Gurmukhs, who bear love and affection for the Guru.
Through true devotional worship, they are attuned to Truth; at the True Door, they are found to be true.
Blessed is their coming into being; they redeem all their ancestors. ||7||
All do their deeds under the Lord's Glance of Grace; no one is beyond His Vision.
According to the Glance of Grace with which the True Lord beholds us, so do we become.
O Nanak, the Glorious Greatness of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is received only by His Mercy. ||8||3||20||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
The Gurmukhs meditate on the Naam; the self-willed manmukhs do not understand.
The faces of the Gurmukhs are always radiant; the Lord has come to dwell within their minds.
Through intuitive understanding they are at peace, and through intuitive understanding they remain absorbed in the Lord. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny, be the slaves of the Lord's slaves.
Service to the Guru is worship of the Guru. How rare are those who obtain it! ||1||Pause||
The happy soul-bride is always with her Husband Lord, if she walks in harmony with the Will of the True Guru.
She attains her Eternal, Ever-stable Husband, who never dies or goes away.
United with the Word of the Shabad, she shall not be separated again. She is immersed in the Lap of her Beloved. ||2||
The Lord is Immaculate and Radiantly Bright; without the Guru, He cannot be found.
He cannot be understood by reading scriptures; the deceitful pretenders are deluded by doubt.
Through the Guru's Teachings, the Lord is always found, and the tongue is permeated with the Sublime Essence of the Lord. ||3||
Emotional attachment to Maya is shed with intuitive ease, through the Guru's Teachings.
