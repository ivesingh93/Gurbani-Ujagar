I have no desire for these. ||2||
The Sanctuary of the Lord's Feet, and dedication to the Saints -
these bring me peace and pleasure.
O Nanak, my burning fire has been put out,
obtaining the Love of the Beloved. ||3||3||143||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The Guru has revealed Him to my eyes. ||1||Pause||
Here and there, in each and every heart, and each and every being, You, O Fascinating Lord, You exist. ||1||
You are the Creator, the Cause of causes, the Support of the earth; You are the One and only, Beauteous Lord. ||2||
Meeting the Saints, and beholding the Blessed Vision of their Darshan, Nanak is a sacrifice to them; he sleeps in absolute peace. ||3||4||144||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is priceless.
It brings peace and poise. ||1||Pause||
The Lord is my Companion and Helper; He shall not forsake me or leave me. He is unfathomable and unequalled. ||1||
He is my Beloved, my brother, father and mother; He is the Support of His devotees. ||2||
The Invisible Lord is seen through the Guru; O Nanak, this is the wondrous play of the Lord. ||3||5||145||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Please help me sustain my devotion.
O Lord Master, I have come to You. ||1||Pause||
With the wealth of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, life becomes fruitful. Lord, please place Your Feet within my heart. ||1||
This is liberation, and this is the best way of life; please, keep me in the Society of the Saints. ||2||
Meditating on the Naam, I am absorbed in celestial peace; O Nanak, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||3||6||146||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The Feet of my Lord and Master are so Beautiful!
The Lord's Saints obtain them. ||1||Pause||
They eradicate their self-conceit and serve the Lord; drenched in His Love, they sing His Glorious Praises. ||1||
They place their hopes in Him, and they thirst for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. Nothing else is pleasing to them. ||2||
This is Your Mercy, Lord; what can Your poor creatures do? Nanak is devoted, a sacrifice to You. ||3||7||147||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Remember the One Lord in meditation within your mind. ||1||Pause||
Meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and enshrine Him within your heart. Without Him there is no other. ||1||
Entering God's Sanctuary, all rewards are obtained, and all pains are taken away. ||2||
He is the Giver of all beings, the Architect of Destiny; O Nanak, He is contained in each and every heart. ||3||8||148||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
One who forgets the Lord is dead. ||1||Pause||
One who meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, obtains all rewards. That person becomes happy. ||1||
One who calls himself a king, and acts in ego and pride, is caught by his doubts, like a parrot in a trap. ||2||
Says Nanak, one who meets the True Guru, becomes permanent and immortal. ||3||9||149||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl, Fourteenth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
That love is forever fresh and new,
which is for the Beloved Lord. ||1||Pause||
One who is pleasing to God shall not be reincarnated again.
He remains absorbed in the loving devotional worship of the Lord, in the Love of the Lord. ||1||
