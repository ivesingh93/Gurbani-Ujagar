When someone tries to appease her,
then she takes pride in herself.
But when someone puts her out of his thoughts,
then she serves him like a slave. ||2||
She seems to please, but in the end, she deceives.
She does not remain in any one place.
She has bewitched a great many worlds.
The Lord's humble servants cut her apart into pieces. ||3||
Whoever begs from her remains hungry.
Whoever is infatuated with her obtains nothing.
But one who renounces her, and joins the Society of the Saints,
by great good fortune, O Nanak, is saved. ||4||18||29||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
See the Lord, the Universal Soul, in all.
The One God is perfect, and all-pervading.
Know that the priceless jewel is within your own heart.
Realize that your essence is within your own self. ||1||
Drink in the Ambrosial Nectar, by the Grace of the Saints.
One who is blessed with high destiny, obtains it. Without a tongue, how can one know the taste? ||1||Pause||
How can a deaf person listen to the eighteen Puraanas and the Vedas?
The blind man cannot see even a million lights.
The beast loves grass, and remains attached to it.
One who has not been taught - how can he understand? ||2||
God, the Knower, knows all.
He is with His devotees, through and through.
Those who sing God's Praises with joy and delight,
O Nanak - the Messenger of Death does not even approach them. ||3||19||30||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
Blessing me with His Name, He has purified and sanctified me.
The Lord's wealth is my capital. False hope has left me; this is my wealth.
Breaking my bonds, the Lord has linked me to His service.
I am a devotee of the Lord, Har, Har; I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||
The unstruck sound current vibrates and resounds.
The Lord's humble servants sing His Glorious Praises with love and delight; they are honored by the Divine Guru. ||1||Pause||
My pre-ordained destiny has been activated;
I have awakened from the sleep of countless incarnations.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, my aversion is gone.
My mind and body are imbued with love for the Lord. ||2||
The Merciful Savior Lord has saved me.
I have no service or work to my credit.
In His Mercy, God has taken pity on me;
He lifted me up and pulled me out, when I was suffering in pain. ||3||
Listening, listening to His Praises, joy has welled up within my mind.
Twenty-four hours a day, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
Singing, singing His Praises, I have obtained the supreme status.
By Guru's Grace, Nanak is lovingly focused on the Lord. ||4||20||31||
Raamkalee, Fifth Mehl:
In exchange for a shell, he gives up a jewel.
He tries to get what he must give up.
He collects those things which are worthless.
Enticed by Maya, he takes the crooked path. ||1||
You unfortunate man - have you no shame?
You do not remember in your mind the ocean of peace, the perfect Transcendent Lord God. ||1||Pause||
Nectar seems bitter to you, and poison is sweet.
Such is your condition, you faithless cynic, which I have seen with my own eyes.
You are fond of falsehood, fraud and egotism.
