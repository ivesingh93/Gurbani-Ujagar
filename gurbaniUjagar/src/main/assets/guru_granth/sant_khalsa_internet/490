Raag Goojaree, Third Mehl, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Cursed is that life, in which the Lord's Love is not obtained.
Cursed is that occupation, in which the Lord is forgotten, and one becomes attached to duality. ||1||
Serve such a True Guru, O my mind, that by serving Him, God's Love may be produced, and all others may be forgotten.
Your consciousness shall remain attached to the Lord; there shall be no fear of old age, and the supreme status shall be obtained. ||1||Pause||
A divine peace wells up from God's Love; behold, it comes from devotional worship.
When my identity consumed my identical identity, then my mind became immaculately pure, and my light was blended with the Divine Light. ||2||
Without good fortune, such a True Guru cannot be found, no matter how much all may yearn for Him.
If the veil of falsehood is removed from within, then lasting peace is obtained. ||3||
O Nanak, what service can the servant perform for such a True Guru? He should offer his life, his very soul, to the Guru.
If he focuses his consciousness on the Will of the True Guru, then the True Guru Himself will bless him. ||4||1||3||
Goojaree, Third Mehl:
Serve the Lord; do not serve anyone else.
Serving the Lord, you shall obtain the fruits of your heart's desires; serving another, your life shall pass away in vain. ||1||
The Lord is my Love, the Lord is my way of life, the Lord is my speech and conversation.
By Guru's Grace, my mind is saturated with the Lord's Love; this is what makes up my service. ||1||Pause||
The Lord is my Simritees, the Lord is my Shaastras; the Lord is my relative and the Lord is my brother.
I am hungry for the Lord; my mind is satisfied with the Name of the Lord. The Lord is my relation, my helper in the end. ||2||
Without the Lord, other assets are false. They do not go with the mortal when he departs.
The Lord is my wealth, which shall go with me; wherever I go, it will go. ||3||
One who is attached to falsehood is false; false are the deeds he does.
Says Nanak, everything happens according to the Will of the Lord; no one has any say in this at all. ||4||2||4||
Goojaree, Third Mehl:
It is so difficult to obtain the Naam, the Name of the Lord, in this age; only the Gurmukh obtains it.
Without the Name, no one is liberated; let anyone make other efforts, and see. ||1||
I am a sacrifice to my Guru; I am forever a sacrifice to Him.
Meeting the True Guru, the Lord comes to dwell in the mind, and one remains absorbed in Him. ||1||Pause||
When God instills His fear, a balanced detachment springs up in the mind.
Through this detachment, the Lord is obtained, and one remains absorbed in the Lord. ||2||
He alone is liberated, who conquers his mind; Maya does not stick to him again.
He dwells in the Tenth Gate, and obtains the understanding of the three worlds. ||3||
O Nanak, through the Guru, one becomes the Guru; behold, His Wondrous Will.
