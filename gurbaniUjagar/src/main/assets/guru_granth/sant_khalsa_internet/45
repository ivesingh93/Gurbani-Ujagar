O my mind, meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
The Naam is your Companion; it shall always be with you. It shall save you in the world hereafter. ||1||Pause||
What good is worldly greatness?
All the pleasures of Maya are tasteless and insipid. In the end, they shall all fade away.
Perfectly fulfilled and supremely acclaimed is the one, in whose heart the Lord abides. ||2||
Become the dust of the Saints; renounce your selfishness and conceit.
Give up all your schemes and your clever mental tricks, and fall at the Feet of the Guru.
He alone receives the Jewel, upon whose forehead such wondrous destiny is written. ||3||
O Siblings of Destiny, it is received only when God Himself bestows it.
People serve the True Guru only when the fever of egotism has been eradicated.
Nanak has met the Guru; all his sufferings have come to an end. ||4||8||78||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
The One is the Knower of all beings; He alone is our Savior.
The One is the Support of the mind; the One is the Support of the breath of life.
In His Sanctuary there is eternal peace. He is the Supreme Lord God, the Creator. ||1||
O my mind, give up all these efforts.
Dwell upon the Perfect Guru each day, and attach yourself to the One Lord. ||1||Pause||
The One is my Brother, the One is my Friend. The One is my Mother and Father.
The One is the Support of the mind; He has given us body and soul.
May I never forget God from my mind; He holds all in the Power of His Hands. ||2||
The One is within the home of the self, and the One is outside as well. He Himself is in all places and interspaces.
Meditate twenty-four hours a day on the One who created all beings and creatures.
Attuned to the Love of the One, there is no sorrow or suffering. ||3||
There is only the One Supreme Lord God; there is no other at all.
Soul and body all belong to Him; whatever pleases His Will come to pass.
Through the Perfect Guru, one becomes perfect; O Nanak, meditate on the True One. ||4||9||79||
Siree Raag, Fifth Mehl:
Those who focus their consciousness on the True Guru are perfectly fulfilled and famous.
Spiritual wisdom wells up in the minds of those unto whom the Lord Himself shows Mercy.
Those who have such destiny written upon their foreheads obtain the Name of the Lord. ||1||
O my mind, meditate on the Name of the One Lord.
The happiness of all happiness shall well up, and in the Court of the Lord, you shall be dressed in robes of honor. ||1||Pause||
The fear of death and rebirth is removed by performing loving devotional service to the Lord of the World.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, one becomes immaculate and pure; the Lord Himself takes care of such a one.
The filth of birth and death is washed away, and one is uplifted, beholding the Blessed Vision of the Guru's Darshan. ||2||
The Supreme Lord God is pervading all places and interspaces.
The One is the Giver of all-there is no other at all.
In His Sanctuary, one is saved. Whatever He wishes, comes to pass. ||3||
Perfectly fulfilled and famous are those, in whose minds the Supreme Lord God abides.
Their reputation is spotless and pure; they are famous all over the world.
O Nanak, I am a sacrifice to those who meditate on my God. ||4||10||80||
