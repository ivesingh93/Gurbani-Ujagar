If you focus your consciousness on the Feet of the One Lord, what reason would you have to chase after greed? ||3||
Meditate on the Immaculate Lord, and saturate your mind with Him.
Why, O Yogi, do you make so many false and deceptive claims? ||1||Pause||
The body is wild, and the mind is foolish. Practicing egotism, selfishness and conceit, your life is passing away.
Prays Nanak, when the naked body is cremated, then you will come to regret and repent. ||4||3||15||
Gauree Chaytee, First Mehl:
O mind, there is only the One medicine, mantra and healing herb - center your consciousness firmly on the One Lord.
Take to the Lord, the Destroyer of the sins and karma of past incarnations. ||1||
The One Lord and Master is pleasing to my mind.
In Your three qualities, the world is engrossed; the Unknowable cannot be known. ||1||Pause||
Maya is so sweet to the body, like sugar or molasses. We all carry loads of it.
In the dark of the night, nothing can be seen. The mouse of death is gnawing away at the rope of life, O Siblings of Destiny! ||2||
As the self-willed manmukhs act, they suffer in pain. The Gurmukh obtains honor and greatness.
Whatever He does, that alone happens; past actions cannot be erased. ||3||
Those who are imbued with, and committed to the Lord's Love, are filled to overflowing; they never lack anything.
If Nanak could be the dust of their feet, then he, the ignorant one, might also obtain some. ||4||4||16||
Gauree Chaytee, First Mehl:
Who is our mother, and who is our father? Where did we come from?
We are formed from the fire of the womb within, and the bubble of water of the sperm. For what purpose are we created? ||1||
O my Master, who can know Your Glorious Virtues?
My own demerits cannot be counted. ||1||Pause||
I took the form of so many plants and trees, and so many animals.
Many times I entered the families of snakes and flying birds. ||2||
I broke into the shops of the city and well-guarded palaces; stealing from them, I come home again.
I looked in front of me, and I looked behind me, but where could I hide from You? ||3||
I saw the banks of sacred rivers, the nine continents, the shops and bazaars of the cities.
Taking the scale, the merchant begins to weigh his actions within his own heart. ||4||
As the seas and the oceans are overflowing with water, so vast are my own sins.
Please, shower me with Your Mercy, and take pity upon me. I am a sinking stone - please carry me across! ||5||
My soul is burning like fire, and the knife is cutting deep.
Prays Nanak, recognizing the Lord's Command, I am at peace, day and night. ||6||5||17||
Gauree Bairaagan, First Mehl:
The nights are wasted sleeping, and the days are wasted eating.
Human life is such a precious jewel, but it is being lost in exchange for a mere shell. ||1||
You do not know the Name of the Lord.
You fool - you shall regret and repent in the end! ||1||Pause||
You bury your temporary wealth in the ground, but how can you love that which is temporary?
Those who have departed, after craving for temporary wealth, have returned home without this temporary wealth. ||2||
If people could gather it in by their own efforts, then everyone would be so lucky.
