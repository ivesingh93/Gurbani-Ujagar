Basant, Fifth Mehl:
You gave us our soul, breath of life and body.
I am a fool, but You have made me beautiful, enshrining Your Light within me.
We are all beggars, O God; You are merciful to us.
Chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, we are uplifted and exalted. ||1||
O my Beloved, only You have the potency to act,
and cause all to be done. ||1||Pause||
Chanting the Naam, the mortal is saved.
Chanting the Naam, sublime peace and poise are found.
Chanting the Naam, honor and glory are received.
Chanting the Naam, no obstacles shall block your way. ||2||
For this reason, you have been blessed with this body, so difficult to obtain.
O my Dear God, please bless me to speak the Naam.
This tranquil peace is found in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
May I always chant and meditate within my heart on Your Name, O God. ||3||
Other than You, there is no one at all.
Everything is Your play; it all merges again into You.
As it pleases Your Will, save me, Lord.
O Nanak, peace is obtained by meeting with the Perfect Guru. ||4||4||
Basant, Fifth Mehl:
My Beloved God, my King is with me.
Gazing upon Him, I live, O my mother.
Remembering Him in meditation, there is no pain or suffering.
Please, take pity on me, and lead me on to meet Him. ||1||
My Beloved is the Support of my breath of life and mind.
This soul, breath of life, and wealth are all Yours, O Lord. ||1||Pause||
He is sought by the angels, mortals and divine beings.
The silent sages, the humble, and the religious teachers do not understand His mystery.
His state and extent cannot be described.
In each and every home of each and every heart, He is permeating and pervading. ||2||
His devotees are totally in bliss.
His devotees cannot be destroyed.
His devotees are not afraid.
His devotees are victorious forever. ||3||
What Praises of Yours can I utter?
God, the Giver of peace, is all-pervading, permeating everywhere.
Nanak begs for this one gift.
Be merciful, and bless me with Your Name. ||4||5||
Basant, Fifth Mehl:
As the plant turns green upon receiving water,
just so, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, egotism is eradicated.
Just as the servant is encouraged by his ruler,
we are saved by the Guru. ||1||
You are the Great Giver, O Generous Lord God.
Each and every instant, I humbly bow to You. ||1||Pause||
Whoever enters the Saadh Sangat-
that humble being is imbued with the Love of the Supreme Lord God.
He is liberated from bondage.
His devotees worship Him in adoration; they are united in His Union. ||2||
My eyes are content, gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan.
My tongue sings the Infinite Praises of God.
My thirst is quenched, by Guru's Grace.
My mind is satisfied, with the sublime taste of the Lord's subtle essence. ||3||
Your servant is committed to the service of Your Feet,
O Primal Infinite Divine Being.
Your Name is the Saving Grace of all.
Nanak has received this treasure. ||4||6||
Basant, Fifth Mehl:
You are the Great Giver; You continue to give.
You permeate and pervade my soul, and my breath of life.
You have given me all sorts of foods and dishes.
I am unworthy; I know none of Your Virtues at all. ||1||
I do not understand anything of Your Worth.
