Maaroo, First Mehl:
In the Primal Void, the Infinite Lord assumed His Power.
He Himself is unattached, infinite and incomparable.
He Himself exercised His Creative Power, and He gazes upon His creation; from the Primal Void, He formed the Void. ||1||
From this Primal Void, He fashioned air and water.
He created the universe, and the king in the fortress of the body.
Your Light pervades fire, water and souls; Your Power rests in the Primal Void. ||2||
From this Primal Void, Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva issued forth.
This Primal Void is pervasive throughout all the ages.
That humble being who contemplates this state is perfect; meeting with him, doubt is dispelled. ||3||
From this Primal Void, the seven seas were established.
The One who created them, Himself contemplates them.
That human being who becomes Gurmukh, who bathes in the pool of Truth, is not cast into the womb of reincarnation again. ||4||
From this Primal Void, came the moon, the sun and the earth.
His Light pervades all the three worlds.
The Lord of this Primal Void is unseen, infinite and immaculate; He is absorbed in the Primal Trance of Deep Meditation. ||5||
From this Primal Void, the earth and the Akaashic Ethers were created.
He supports them without any visible support, by exercising His True Power.

From this Primal Void, came the four sources of creation, and the power of speech.
They were created from the Void, and they will merge into the Void.

From this Primal Void, He made both night and day;
creation and destruction, pleasure and pain.
The Gurmukh is immortal, untouched by pleasure and pain. He obtains the home of his own inner being. ||8||
