They find their Husband Lord within their own home, contemplating the True Word of the Shabad. ||1||
Through merits, their demerits are forgiven, and they embrace love for the Lord.
The soul-bride then obtains the Lord as her Husband; meeting the Guru, this union comes about. ||1||Pause||
Some do not know the Presence of their Husband Lord; they are deluded by duality and doubt.
How can the forsaken brides meet Him? Their life night passes in pain. ||2||
Those whose minds are filled with the True Lord, perform truthful actions.
Night and day, they serve the Lord with poise, and are absorbed in the True Lord. ||3||
The forsaken brides wander around, deluded by doubt; telling lies, they eat poison.
They do not know their Husband Lord, and upon their deserted bed, they suffer in misery. ||4||
The True Lord is the One and only; do not be deluded by doubt, O my mind.
Consult with the Guru, serve the True Lord, and enshrine the Immaculate Truth within your mind. ||5||
The happy soul-bride always finds her Husband Lord; she banishes egotism and self-conceit.
She remains attached to her Husband Lord, night and day, and she finds peace upon His Bed of Truth. ||6||
Those who shouted, "Mine, mine!" have departed, without obtaining anything.
The separated one does not obtain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence, and departs, repenting in the end. ||7||
That Husband Lord of mine is the One and only; I am in love with the One alone.
O Nanak, if the soul-bride longs for peace, she should enshrine the Lord's Name within her mind. ||8||11||33||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
Those whom the Lord has caused to drink in the Ambrosial Nectar, naturally, intuitively, enjoy the sublime essence.
The True Lord is care-free; he does not have even an iota of greed. ||1||
The True Ambrosial Nectar rains down, and trickles into the mouths of the Gurmukhs.
Their minds are forever rejuvenated, and they naturally, intuitively, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
The self-willed manmukhs are forever forsaken brides; they cry out and bewail at the Lord's Gate.
Those who do not enjoy the sublime taste of their Husband Lord, act according to their pre-ordained destiny. ||2||
The Gurmukh plants the seed of the True Name, and it sprouts. He deals in the True Name alone.
Those whom the Lord has attached to this profitable venture, are granted the treasure of devotional worship. ||3||
The Gurmukh is forever the true, happy soul-bride; she adorns herself with the fear of God and devotion to Him.
Night and day, she enjoys her Husband Lord; she keeps Truth enshrined within her heart. ||4||
I am a sacrifice to those who have enjoyed their Husband Lord.
They dwell forever with their Husband Lord; they eradicate self-conceit from within. ||5||
Their bodies and minds are cooled and soothed, and their faces are radiant, from the love and affection of their Husband Lord.
They enjoy their Husband Lord upon His cozy bed, having conquered their ego and desire. ||6||
Granting His Grace, He comes into our homes, through our infinite Love for the Guru.
The happy soul-bride obtains the One Lord as her Husband. ||7||
All of her sins are forgiven; the Uniter unites her with Himself.
O Nanak, chant such chants, that hearing them, He may enshrine love for you. ||8||12||34||
Aasaa, Third Mehl:
Merit is obtained from the True Guru, when God causes us to meet Him.
