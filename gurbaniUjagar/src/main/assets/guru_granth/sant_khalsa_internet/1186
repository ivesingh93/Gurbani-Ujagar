You are the Great Giver; You are so very Wise. There is no other like You.
You are my All-powerful Lord and Master; I do not know how to worship You. ||3||
Your Mansion is imperceptible, O my Beloved; it is so difficult to accept Your Will.
Says Nanak, I have collapsed at Your Door, Lord. I am foolish and ignorant - please save me! ||4||2||20||
Basant Hindol, Fifth Mehl:
The mortal does not know the Primal Lord God; he does not understand himself. He is engrossed in doubt and egotism. ||1||
My Father is the Supreme Lord God, my Master.
I am unworthy, but please save me anyway. ||1||Pause||
Creation and destruction come only from God; this is what the Lord's humble servants believe. ||2||
Only those who are imbued with God's Name are judged to be peaceful in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga. ||3||
It is the Guru's Word that carries us across; Nanak cannot think of any other way. ||4||3||21||
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Raag Basant Hindol, Ninth Mehl:
O Holy Saints, know that this body is false.
The Lord who dwells within it - recognize that He alone is real. ||1||Pause||
The wealth of this world is only a dream; why are you so proud of it?
None of it shall go along with you in the end; why do you cling to it? ||1||
Leave behind both praise and slander; enshrine the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises within your heart.
O servant Nanak, the One Primal Being, the Lord God, is totally permeating everywhere. ||2||1||
Basant, Ninth Mehl:
The heart of the sinner is filled with unfulfilled sexual desire.
He cannot control his fickle mind. ||1||Pause||
The Yogis, wandering ascetics and renunciates -
this net is cast over them all. ||1||
Those who contemplate the Name of the Lord
cross over the terrifying world-ocean. ||2||
Servant Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord.
Please bestow the blessing of Your Name, that he may continue to sing Your Glorious Praises. ||3||2||
Basant, Ninth Mehl:
O mother, I have gathered the wealth of the Lord's Name.
My mind has stopped its wanderings, and now, it has come to rest. ||1||Pause||
Attachment to Maya has run away from my body, and immaculate spiritual wisdom has welled up within me.
Greed and attachment cannot even touch me; I have grasped hold of devotional worship of the Lord. ||1||
The cynicism of countless lifetimes has been eradicated, since I obtained the jewel of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
My mind was rid of all its desires, and I was absorbed in the peace of my own inner being. ||2||
That person, unto whom the Merciful Lord shows compassion, sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe.
Says Nanak, this wealth is gathered only by the Gurmukh. ||3||3||
Basant, Ninth Mehl:
O my mind, how can you forget the Lord's Name?
When the body perishes, you shall have to deal with the Messenger of Death. ||1||Pause||
This world is just a hill of smoke.
