The ointment of spiritual wisdom is obtained from the True Guru.
The Lord's Name is pervading the three worlds. ||3||
In Kali Yuga, it is the time for the One Dear Lord; it is not the time for anything else.
O Nanak, as Gurmukh, let the Lord's Name grow within your heart. ||4||10||
Bhairao, Third Mehl, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The self-willed manmukhs are afflicted with the disease of duality; they are burnt by the intense fire of desire.
They dIE and dIE again, and are reborn; they find no place of rest. They waste their lives uselessly. ||1||
O my Beloved, grant Your Grace, and give me understanding.
The world was created in the disease of egotism; without the Word of the Shabad, the disease is not cured. ||1||Pause||
There are so many silent sages, who read the Simritees and the Shaastras; without the Shabad, they have no clear awareness.
All those under the influence of the three qualities are afflicted with the disease; through possessiveness, they lose their awareness. ||2||
O God, you save some, and you enjoin others to serve the Guru.
They obtain the treasure of the Name of the Lord; peace comes to abide within their minds. ||3||
The Gurmukhs dwell in the fourth state; they obtain a dwelling in the home of their own inner being.
The Perfect True Guru shows His Mercy to them; they eradicate their self-conceit from within. ||4||
Everyone must serve the One Lord, who created Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.
O Nanak, the One True Lord is permanent and stable. He does not die, and He is not born. ||5||1||11||
Bhairao, Third Mehl:
The self-willed manmukh is afflicted with the disease of duality forever; the entire universe is diseased.
The Gurmukh understands, and is cured of the disease, contemplating the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||1||
O Dear Lord, please let me join the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation.
O Nanak, the Lord blesses with glorious greatness, those who focus their consciousness on the Lord's Name. ||1||Pause||
Death takes all those who are afflicted with the disease of possessiveness. They are subject to the Messenger of Death.
The Messenger of Death does not even approach that mortal who, as Gurmukh, enshrines the Lord within his heart. ||2||
One who does not know the Lord's Name, and who does not become Gurmukh - why did he even come into the world?
He never serves the Guru; he wastes his life uselessly. ||3||
O Nanak, those whom the True Guru enjoins to His service, have perfect good fortune.
They obtain the fruits of their desires, and find peace in the Word of the Guru's Bani. ||4||2||12||
Bhairao, Third Mehl:
In pain he is born, in pain he dies, and in pain he does his deeds.
He is never released from the womb of reincarnation; he rots away in manure. ||1||
Cursed, cursed is the self-willed manmukh, who wastes his life away.
He does not serve the Perfect Guru; he does not love the Name of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
The Word of the Guru's Shabad cures all diseases; he alone is attached to it, whom the Dear Lord attaches.
