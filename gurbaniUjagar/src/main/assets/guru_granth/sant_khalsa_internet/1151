Their fears and doubts are dispelled in an instant.
The Supreme Lord God comes to dwell in their minds. ||1||
The Lord is forever the Help and Support of the Saints.
Inside the home of the heart, and outside as well, the Transcendent Lord is always with us, permeating and pervading all places. ||1||Pause||
The Lord of the World is my wealth, property, youth and ways and means.
He continually cherishes and brings peace to my soul and breath of life.
He reaches out with His Hand and saves His slave.
He does not abandon us, even for an instant; He is always with us. ||2||
There is no other Beloved like the Lord.
The True Lord takes care of all.
The Lord is our Mother, Father, Son and Relation.
Since the beginning of time, and throughout the ages, His devotees sing His Glorious Praises. ||3||
My mind is filled with the Support and the Power of the Lord.
Without the Lord, there is no other at all.
Nanak's mind is encouraged by this hope,
that God will accomplish my objectives in life. ||4||38||51||
Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
Fear itself becomes afraid, when the mortal remembers the Lord's Name in meditation.
All the diseases of the three gunas - the three qualities - are cured, and tasks of the Lord's slaves are perfectly accomplished. ||1||Pause||
The people of the Lord always sing His Glorious Praises; they attain His Perfect Mansion.
Even the Righteous Judge of Dharma and the Messenger of Death yearn, day and night, to be sanctified by the Blessed Vision of the Lord's humble servant. ||1||
Sexual desire, anger, intoxication, egotism, slander and egotistical pride are eradicated in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
By great good fortune, such Saints are met. Nanak is forever a sacrifice to them. ||2||39||52||
Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
One who harbors the five thieves, becomes the embodiment of these five.
He gets up each day and tells lies.
He applies ceremonial religious marks to his body, but practices hypocrisy.
He wastes away in sadness and pain, like a lonely widow. ||1||
Without the Name of the Lord, everything is false.
Without the Perfect Guru, liberation is not obtained. In the Court of the True Lord, the faithless cynic is plundered. ||1||Pause||
One who does not know the Lord's Creative Power is polluted.
Ritualistically plastering one's kitchen square does not make it pure in the Eyes of the Lord.
If a person is polluted within, he may wash himself everyday on the outside,
but in the Court of the True Lord, he forfeits his honor. ||2||
He works for the sake of Maya,
but he never places his feet on the right path.
He never even remembers the One who created him.
He speaks falsehood, only falsehood, with his mouth. ||3||
That person, unto whom the Creator Lord shows Mercy,
deals with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
One who lovingly worships the Lord's Name,
says Nanak - no obstacles ever block his way. ||4||40||53||
Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
The entire universe curses the slanderer.
False are the dealings of the slanderer.
The slanderer's lifestyle is filthy and polluted.
The Lord is the Saving Grace and the Protector of His slave. ||1||
The slanderer dies with the rest of the slanderers.
The Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent Lord, protects and saves His humble servant. Death roars and thunders over the head of the slanderer. ||1||Pause||
