The minds of the Gurmukhs are filled with faith; through the Perfect Guru, they merge in the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||1||
O my mind, the sermon of the Lord, Har, Har, is pleasing to my mind.
Continually and forever, speak the sermon of the Lord, Har, Har; as Gurmukh, speak the Unspoken Speech. ||1||Pause||
I have searched through and through my mind and body; how can I attain this Unspoken Speech?
Meeting with the humble Saints, I have found it; listening to the Unspoken Speech, my mind is pleased.
The Lord's Name is the Support of my mind and body; I am united with the all-knowing Primal Lord God. ||2||
The Guru, the Primal Being, has united me with the Primal Lord God. My consciousness has merged into the supreme consciousness.
By great good fortune, I serve the Guru, and I have found my Lord, all-wise and all-knowing.
The self-willed manmukhs are very unfortunate; they pass their life-night in misery and pain. ||3||
I am just a meek beggar at Your Door, God; please, place the Ambrosial Word of Your Bani in my mouth.
The True Guru is my friend; He unites me with my all-wise, all-knowing Lord God.
Servant Nanak has entered Your Sanctuary; grant Your Grace, and merge me into Your Name. ||4||3||5||
Maaroo, Fourth Mehl:
Detached from the world, I am in love with the Lord; by great good fortune, I have enshrined the Lord within my mind.
Joining the Sangat, the Holy Congregation, faith has welled up within me; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, I taste the sublime essence of the Lord.
My mind and body have totally blossomed forth; through the Word of the Guru's Bani, I chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||
O my beloved mind, my friend, taste the sublime essence of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
Through the Perfect Guru, I have found the Lord, who saves my honor, here and hereafter. ||1||Pause||
Meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; as Gurmukh, taste the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises.
Plant the seed of the Lord in the body-farm. The Lord God is enshrined within the Sangat, the Holy Congregation.
The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is Ambrosial Nectar. Through the Perfect Guru, taste the sublime essence of the Lord. ||2||
The self-willed manmukhs are filled with hunger and thirst; their minds run around in the ten directions, hoping for great wealth.
Without the Name of the Lord, their life is cursed; the manmukhs are stuck in manure.
They come and go, and are consigned to wander through uncounted incarnations, eating stinking rot. ||3||
Begging, imploring, I seek Your Sanctuary; Lord, shower me with Your Mercy, and save me, God.
Lead me to join the Society of the Saints, and bless me with the honor and glory of the Lord's Name.
I have obtained the wealth of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; servant Nanak chants the Lord's Name, through the Guru's Teachings. ||4||4||6||
Maaroo, Fourth Mehl, Fifth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Devotional worship to the Lord, Har, Har, is an overflowing treasure.
The Gurmukh is emancipated by the Lord.
One who is blessed by the Mercy of my Lord and Master sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||1||
O Lord, Har, Har, take pity on me,
that within my heart, I may dwell upon You, Lord, forever and ever.
Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my soul; chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, you shall be emancipated. ||1||Pause||
