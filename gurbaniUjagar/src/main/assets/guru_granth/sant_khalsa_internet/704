O intimate friend, you have enjoyed your Beloved; please, tell me about Him.
They alone find their Beloved, who eradicate self-conceit; such is the good destiny written on their foreheads.
Taking me by the arm, the Lord and Master has made me His own; He has not considered my merits or demerits.
She, whom You have adorned with the necklace of virtue, and dyed in the deep crimson color of His Love - everything looks beautiful on her.
O servant Nanak, blessed is that happy soul-bride, who dwells with her Husband Lord. ||3||
O intimate friend, I have found that peace which I sought.
My sought-after Husband Lord has come home, and now, congratulations are pouring in.
Great joy and happiness welled up, when my Husband Lord, of ever-fresh beauty, showed mercy to me.
By great good fortune, I have found Him; the Guru has united me with Him, through the Saadh Sangat, the True Congregation of the Holy.
My hopes and desires have all been fulfilled; my Beloved Husband Lord has hugged me close in His embrace.
Prays Nanak, I have found that peace which I sought, meeting with the Guru. ||4||1||
Jaitsree, Fifth Mehl, Second House, Chhant:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Shalok:
God is lofty, unapproachable and infinite. He is indescribable - He cannot be described.
Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of God, who is all-powerful to save us. ||1||
Chhant:
Save me, any way You can; O Lord God, I am Yours.
My demerits are uncountable; how many of them should I count?
The sins and crimes I committed are countless; day by day, I continually make mistakes.
I am intoxicated by emotional attachment to Maya, the treacherous one; by Your Grace alone can I be saved.
Secretly, I commit hideous sins of corruption, even though God is the nearest of the near.
Prays Nanak, shower me with Your Mercy, Lord, and lift me up, out of the whirlpool of the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||
Shalok:
Countless are His virtues; they cannot be enumerated. God's Name is lofty and exalted.
This is Nanak's humble prayer, to bless the homeless with a home. ||2||
Chhant:
There is no other place at all - where else should I go?
Twenty-four hours a day, with my palms pressed together, I meditate on God.
Meditating forever on my God, I receive the fruits of my mind's desires.
Renouncing pride, attachment, corruption and duality, I lovingly center my attention on the One Lord.
Dedicate your mind and body to God; eradicate all your self-conceit.
Prays Nanak, shower me with Your mercy, Lord, that I may be absorbed in Your True Name. ||2||
Shalok:
O mind, meditate on the One, who holds everything in His hands.
Gather the wealth of the Lord's Name; O Nanak, it shall always be with You. ||3||
Chhant:
God is our only True Friend; there is not any other.
In the places and interspaces, in the water and on the land, He Himself is pervading everywhere.
He is totally permeating the water, the land and the sky; God is the Great Giver, the Lord and Master of all.
The Lord of the world, the Lord of the universe has no limit; His Glorious Virtues are unlimited - how can I count them?
I have hurried to the Sanctuary of the Lord Master, the Bringer of peace; without Him, there is no other at all.
Prays Nanak, that being, unto whom the Lord shows mercy - he alone obtains the Naam. ||3||
