One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
You are the True Creator, my Lord Master.
That which is pleasing to Your Will, comes to pass. Whatever You give, that is what I receive. ||1||Pause||
All are Yours; all meditate on You.
He alone, whom You bless with Your Mercy, obtains the jewel of the Naam.
The Gurmukhs obtain it, and the self-willed manmukhs lose it.
You Yourself separate the mortals, and You Yourself unite them. ||1||
You are the River - all are within You.
Other than You, there is no one at all.
All beings and creatures are your play-things.
The united ones are separated, and the separated ones are re-united. ||2||

he continually speaks and chants the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
One who serves the Lord, obtains peace.
He is easily absorbed in the Lord's Name. ||3||
You Yourself are the Creator; by Your doing, all things come to be.
Without You, there is no other at all.
You watch over the creation, and understand it.
O servant Nanak, the Lord is revealed to the Gurmukh. ||4||1||53||
