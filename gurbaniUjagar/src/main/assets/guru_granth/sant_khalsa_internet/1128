So much sin and corruption comes from this pride. ||1||Pause||
Everyone says that there are four castes, four social classes.
They all emanate from the drop of God's Seed. ||2||
The entire universe is made of the same clay.
The Potter has shaped it into all sorts of vessels. ||3||
The five elements join together, to make up the form of the human body.
Who can say which is less, and which is more? ||4||
Says Nanak, this soul is bound by its actions.
Without meeting the True Guru, it is not liberated. ||5||1||
Bhairao, Third Mehl:
The Yogis, the householders, the Pandits, the religious scholars, and the beggars in religious robes -
they are all asleep in egotism. ||1||
They are asleep, intoxicated with the wine of Maya.
Only those who remain awake and aware are not robbed. ||1||Pause||
One who has met the True Guru, remains awake and aware.
Such a person overpowers the five thieves. ||2||
One who contemplates the essence of reality remains awake and aware.
He kills his self-conceit, and does not kill anyone else. ||3||
One who knows the One Lord remains awake and aware.
He abandons the service of others, and realizes the essence of reality. ||4||
Of the four castes, whoever remains awake and aware
is released from birth and death. ||5||
Says Nanak, that humble being remains awake and aware,
who applies the ointment of spiritual wisdom to his eyes. ||6||2||
Bhairao, Third Mehl:
Whoever the Lord keeps in His Sanctuary,
is attached to the Truth, and receives the fruit of Truth. ||1||
O mortal, unto whom will you complain?
The Hukam of the Lord's Command is pervasive; by the Hukam of His Command, all things happen. ||1||Pause||
This Creation was established by You.
In an instant You destroy it, and You create it again without a moment's delay. ||2||
By His Grace, He has staged this Play.
By the Guru's Merciful Grace, I have obtained the supreme status. ||3||
Says Nanak, He alone kills and revives.
Understand this well - do not be confused by doubt. ||4||3||
Bhairao, Third Mehl:
I am the bride; the Creator is my Husband Lord.
As He inspires me, I adorn myself. ||1||
When it pleases Him, He enjoys me.
I am joined, body and mind, to my True Lord and Master. ||1||Pause||
How can anyone praise or slander anyone else?
The One Lord Himself is pervading and permeating all. ||2||
By Guru's Grace, I am attracted by His Love.
I shall meet with my Merciful Lord, and vibrate the Panch Shabad, the Five Primal Sounds. ||3||
Prays Nanak, what can anyone do?
He alone meets with the Lord, whom the Lord Himself meets. ||4||4||
Bhairao, Third Mehl:
He alone is a silent sage, who subdues his mind's duality.
Subduing his duality, he contemplates God. ||1||
Let each person examine his own mind, O Siblings of Destiny.
Examine your mind, and you shall obtain the nine treasures of the Naam. ||1||Pause||
The Creator created the world, upon the foundation of worldly love and attachment.
Attaching it to possessiveness, He has led it into confusion with doubt. ||2||
From this Mind come all bodies, and the breath of life.
By mental contemplation, the mortal realizes the Hukam of the Lord's Command, and merges in Him. ||3||
