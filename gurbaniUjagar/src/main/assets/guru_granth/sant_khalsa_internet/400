Serving the Guru, the Mansion of the Lord's Presence is obtained, and the impassable world-ocean is crossed over. ||2||
By Your Glance of Grace, peace is obtained, and the treasure fills the mind.
That servant, unto whom You bestow Your Mercy, is approved and accepted. ||3||
How rare is that person who drinks in the Ambrosial Essence of the Lord's Kirtan.
Nanak has obtained the commodity of the One Name; he lives by chanting and meditating on it within his heart. ||4||14||116||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
I am God's maid-servant; He is the highest of all.
All things, big and small, are said to belong to Him. ||1||
I surrender my soul, my breath of life, and my wealth, to my Lord Master.
Through His Name, I become radiant; I am known as His slave. ||1||Pause||
You are Carefree, the Embodiment of Bliss. Your Name is a gem, a jewel.
One who has You as her Master, is satisfied, satiated and happy forever. ||2||
O my companions and fellow maidens, please implant that balanced understanding within me.
Serve the Holy Saints lovingly, and find the treasure of the Lord. ||3||
All are servants of the Lord Master, and all call Him their own.
She alone dwells in peace, O Nanak, whom the Lord adorns. ||4||15||117||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Become the servant of the Saints, and learn this way of life.
Of all virtues, the most sublime virtue is to see your Husband Lord near at hand. ||1||
So, dye this mind of yours with the color of the Lord's Love.
Renounce cleverness and cunning, and know that the Sustainer of the world is with you. ||1||Pause||
Whatever your Husband Lord says, accept that, and make it your decoration.
Forget the love of duality, and chew upon this betel leaf. ||2||
Make the Word of the Guru's Shabad your lamp, and let your bed be Truth.
Twenty-four hours a day, stand with your palms pressed together, and the Lord, your King, shall meet you. ||3||
She alone is cultured and embellished, and she alone is of incomparable beauty.
She alone is the happy soul-bride, O Nanak, who is pleasing to the Creator Lord. ||4||16||118||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
As long as there are doubts in the mind, the mortal staggers and falls.
The Guru removed my doubts, and I have obtained my place of rest. ||1||
Those quarrelsome enemies have been overcome, through the Guru.
I have now escaped from them, and they have run away from me. ||1||Pause||
He is concerned with 'mine and yours', and so he is held in bondage.
When the Guru dispelled my ignorance, then the noose of death was cut away from my neck. ||2||
As long as he does not understand the Command of God's Will, he remains miserable.
Meeting with the Guru, he comes to recognize God's Will, and then, he becomes happy. ||3||
I have no enemies and no adversaries; no one is wicked to me.
That servant, who performs the Lord's service, O Nanak, is the slave of the Lord Master. ||4||17||119||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Peace, celestial poise and absolute bliss are obtained, singing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises.
Bestowing His Name, the True Guru removes the evil omens. ||1||
I am a sacrifice to my Guru; forever and ever, I am a sacrifice to Him.
