Siree Raag, Third Mehl, First House:
Everyone belongs to the One who rules the Universe.
The Gurmukh practices good deeds, and the truth is revealed in the heart.
True is the reputation of the true, within whom truth abides.
Those who meet the True Lord are not separated again; they come to dwell in the home of the self deep within. ||1||
O my Lord! Without the Lord, I have no other at all.
The True Guru leads us to meet the Immaculate True God through the Word of His Shabad. ||1||Pause||
One whom the Lord merges into Himself is merged in the Shabad, and remains so merged.
No one merges with Him through the love of duality; over and over again, they come and go in reincarnation.
The One Lord permeates all. The One Lord is pervading everywhere.
That Gurmukh, unto whom the Lord shows His Kindness, is absorbed in the Naam, the Name of the Lord. ||2||
After all their reading, the Pandits, the religious scholars, and the astrologers argue and debate.
Their intellect and understanding are perverted; they just don't understand. They are filled with greed and corruption.
Through 8.4 million incarnations they wander lost and confused; through all their wandering and roaming, they are ruined.
They act according to their pre-ordained destiny, which no one can erase. ||3||
It is very difficult to serve the True Guru. Surrender your head; give up your selfishness.
Realizing the Shabad, one meets with the Lord, and all one's service is accepted.
By personally experiencing the Personality of the Guru, one's own personality is uplifted, and one's light merges into the Light.
Those who have such pre-ordained destiny come to meet the True Guru. ||4||
O mind, don't cry out that you are hungry, always hungry; stop complaining.
The One who created the 8.4 million species of beings gives sustenance to all.
The Fearless Lord is forever Merciful; He takes care of all.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh understands, and finds the Door of Liberation. ||5||3||36||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Those who hear and believe, find the home of the self deep within.
Through the Guru's Teachings, they praise the True Lord; they find the Lord, the Treasure of Excellence.
Attuned to the Word of the Shabad, they are immaculate and pure. I am forever a sacrifice to them.
Those people, within whose hearts the Lord abides, are radiant and enlightened. ||1||
O my mind, meditate on the Immaculate Lord, Har, Har.
Those whose have such pre-ordained destiny written on their foreheads-those Gurmukhs remain absorbed in the Lord's Love. ||1||Pause||
O Saints, see clearly that the Lord is near at hand; He is pervading everywhere.
Those who follow the Guru's Teachings realize Him, and see Him Ever-present.
He dwells forever in the minds of the virtuous. He is far removed from those worthless people who lack virtue.
The self-willed manmukhs are totally without virtue. Without the Name, they dIE in frustration. ||2||
Those who hear and believe in the Word of the Guru's Shabad, meditate on the Lord in their minds.
Night and day, they are steeped in devotion; their minds and bodies become pure.
The color of the world is false and weak; when it washes away, people cry out in pain.
Those who have the Radiant Light of the Naam within, become steady and stable, forever and ever. ||3||
