Abandon your deception, and go beyond vengeance; see God who is always with you.
Deal only in this true wealth and gather in this true wealth, and you shall never suffer loss. ||1||
Eating and consuming it, it is never exhausted; God's treasures are overflowing.
Says Nanak, you shall go home to the Court of the Supreme Lord God with honor and respect. ||2||57||80||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
O Dear God, I am wretched and helpless!
From what source did you create humans? This is Your Glorious Grandeur. ||1||Pause||
You are the Giver of the soul and the breath of life to all; Your Infinite Glories cannot be spoken.
You are the Beloved Lord of all, the Cherisher of all, the Support of all hearts. ||1||
No one knows Your state and extent. You alone created the expanse of the Universe.
Please, give me a seat in the boat of the Holy; O Nanak, thus I shall cross over this terrifying world-ocean, and reach the other shore. ||2||58||81||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
One who comes to the Lord's Sanctuary is very fortunate.
He knows of no other than the One Lord. He has renounced all other efforts. ||1||Pause||
He worships and adores the Lord, Har, Har, in thought, word and deed; in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, he finds peace.
He enjoys bliss and pleasure, and savors the Unspoken Speech of the Lord; he merges intuitively into the True Lord. ||1||
Sublime and exalted is the speech of one whom the Lord, in His Mercy makes His Own.
Those who are imbued with God in the state of Nirvaanaa, O Nanak, are emancipated in the Saadh Sangat. ||2||59||82||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Since I grasped hold of the Sanctuary of the Holy,
my mind is illuminated with tranquility, peace and poise, and I am rid of all my pain. ||1||Pause||
Please be merciful to me, O Lord, and bless me with Your Name; this is the prayer I offer to You.
I have forgotten my other occupations; remembering God in meditation, I have obtained the true profit. ||1||
We shall merge again into the One from whom we came; He is the Essence of Being.
Says Nanak, the Guru has eradicated my doubt; my light has merged into the Light. ||2||60||83||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
O my tongue, sing the Praises of the Lord.
Abandon all other tastes and flavors; the taste of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is so sublime. ||1||Pause||
Enshrine the Lord's Lotus Feet within your heart; let yourself be lovingly attuned to the One Lord.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, you shall become immaculate and pure; you shall not come to be reincarnated again. ||1||
You are the Support of the soul and the breath of life; You are the Home of the homeless.
With each and every breath, I dwell on the Lord, Har, Har; O Nanak, I am forever a sacrifice to Him. ||2||61||84||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
To meditate on the Lotus Feet of the Lord of the Universe is heaven for me.
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is the treasure of liberation and the Lord's Ambrosial Name. ||1||Pause||
O Lord God, please be kind to me, that I may hear with my ears Your Sublime and Exalted Sermon.
My cycle of coming and going is finally completed, and I have attained peace and tranquility. ||1||
