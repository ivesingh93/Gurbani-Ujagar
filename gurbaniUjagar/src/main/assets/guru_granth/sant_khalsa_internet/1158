The Sovereign Lord is the nine treasures for me.
The possessions and the spouse to which the mortal is lovingly attached, are Your wealth, O Lord. ||1||Pause||
They do not come with the mortal, and they do not go with him.
What good does it do him, if he has elephants tied up at his doorway? ||2||
The fortress of Sri Lanka was made out of gold,
but what could the foolish Raawan take with him when he left? ||3||
Says Kabeer, think of doing some good deeds.
In the end, the gambler shall depart empty-handed. ||4||2||
Brahma is polluted, and Indra is polluted.
The sun is polluted, and the moon is polluted. ||1||
This world is polluted with pollution.
Only the One Lord is Immaculate; He has no end or limitation. ||1||Pause||
The rulers of kingdoms are polluted.
Nights and days, and the days of the month are polluted. ||2||
The pearl is polluted, the diamond is polluted.
Wind, fire and water are polluted. ||3||
Shiva, Shankara and Mahaysh are polluted.
The Siddhas, seekers and strivers, and those who wear religious robes, are polluted. ||4||
The Yogis and wandering hermits with their matted hair are polluted.
The body, along with the swan-soul, is polluted. ||5||
Says Kabeer, those humble beings are approved,
and pure, who know the Lord. ||6||3||
Let your mind be Mecca, and your body the temple of worship.
Let the Supreme Guru be the One who speaks. ||1||
O Mullah, utter the call to prayer.
The one mosque has ten doors. ||1||Pause||
So slaughter your evil nature, doubt and cruelty;
consume the five demons and you shall be blessed with contentment. ||2||
Hindus and Muslims have the same One Lord and Master.
What can the Mullah do, and what can the Shaykh do? ||3||
Says Kabeer, I have gone insane.
Slaughtering, slaughtering my mind, I have merged into the Celestial Lord. ||4||4||
When the stream flows into the Ganges,
then it becomes the Ganges. ||1||
Just so, Kabeer has changed.
He has become the Embodiment of Truth, and he does not go anywhere else. ||1||Pause||
Associating with the sandalwood tree, the tree nearby is changed;
that tree begins to smell just like the sandalwood tree. ||2||
Coming into contact with the philosophers' stone, copper is transformed;
that copper is transformed into gold. ||3||
In the Society of the Saints, Kabeer is transformed;
that Kabeer is transformed into the Lord. ||4||5||
Some apply ceremonial marks to their foreheads, hold malas in their hands, and wear religious robes.
Some people think that the Lord is a play-thing. ||1||
If I am insane, then I am Yours, O Lord.
How can people know my secret? ||1||Pause||
I do not pick leaves as offerings, and I do not worship idols.
Without devotional worship of the Lord, service is useless. ||2||
I worship the True Guru; forever and ever, I surrender to Him.
By such service, I find peace in the Court of the Lord. ||3||
People say that Kabeer has gone insane.
Only the Lord realizes the secret of Kabeer. ||4||6||
Turning away from the world, I have forgotten both my social class and ancestry.
My weaving now is in the most profound celestial stillness. ||1||
I have no quarrel with anyone.
