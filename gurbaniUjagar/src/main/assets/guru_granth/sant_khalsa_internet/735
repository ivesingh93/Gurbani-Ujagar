Soohee, Fourth Mehl, Seventh House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Which, which of Your Glorious Virtues should I sing and recount, Lord? You are my Lord and Master, the treasure of excellence.
I cannot express Your Glorious Praises. You are my Lord and Master, lofty and benevolent. ||1||
The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is my only support.
If it pleases You, please save me, O my Lord and Master; without You, I have no other at all. ||1||Pause||
You alone are my strength, and my Court, O my Lord and Master; unto You alone I pray.
There is no other place where I can offer my prayers; I can tell my pains and pleasures only to You. ||2||
Water is locked up in the earth, and fire is locked up in wood.
The sheep and the lions are kept in one place; O mortal, meditate on the Lord, and your doubts and fears shall be removed. ||3||
So behold the glorious greatness of the Lord, O Saints; the Lord blesses the dishonored with honor.
As dust rises from underfoot, O Nanak, so does the Lord make all people fall at the feet of the Holy. ||4||1||12||
Soohee, Fourth Mehl:
You Yourself, O Creator, know everything; what can I possibly tell You?
You know all the bad and the good; as we act, so are we rewarded. ||1||
O my Lord and Master, You alone know the state of my inner being.
You know all the bad and the good; as it pleases You, so You make us speak. ||1||Pause||
The Lord has infused the love of Maya into all bodies; through this human body, there comes the opportunity to worship the Lord with devotion.
You unite some with the True Guru, and bless them with peace; while others, the self-willed manmukhs, are engrossed in worldly affairs. ||2||
All belong to You, and You belong to all, O my Creator Lord; You wrote the words of destiny on the forehead of everyone.
As You bestow Your Glance of Grace, so are mortals made; without Your Gracious Glance, no one assumes any form. ||3||
You alone know Your Glorious Greatness; everyone constantly meditates on You.
That being, with whom You are pleased, is united with You; O servant Nanak, only such a mortal is accepted. ||4||2||13||
Soohee, Fourth Mehl:
Those beings, within whose inner selves my Lord, Har, Har, dwells - all their diseases are cured.
They alone become liberated, who meditate on the Name of the Lord; they obtain the supreme status. ||1||
O my Lord, the Lord's humble servants become healthy.
Those who meditate on my Lord, Har, Har, through the Word of the Guru's Teachings, are rid of the disease of ego. ||1||Pause||
Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva suffer from the disease of the three gunas - the three qualities; they do their deeds in egotism.
The poor fools do not remember the One who created them; this understanding of the Lord is only obtained by those who become Gurmukh. ||2||
The entire world is afflicted by the disease of egotism. They suffer the terrible pains of birth and death.
