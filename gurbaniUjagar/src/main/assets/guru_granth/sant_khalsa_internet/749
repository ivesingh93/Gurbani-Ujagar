Your Saints are very fortunate; their homes are filled with the wealth of the Lord's Name.
Their birth is approved, and their actions are fruitful. ||1||
O my Lord, I am a sacrifice to the humble servants of the Lord.
I make my hair into a fan, and wave it over them; I apply the dust of their feet to my face. ||1||Pause||
Those generous, humble beings are above both birth and death.
They give the gift of the soul, and practice devotional worship; they inspire others to meet the Lord. ||2||
True are their commands, and true are their empires; they are attuned to the Truth.
True is their happiness, and true is their greatness. They know the Lord, to whom they belong. ||3||
I wave the fan over them, carry water for them, and grind corn for the humble servants of the Lord.
Nanak offers this prayer to God - please, grant me the sight of Your humble servants. ||4||7||54||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
The True Guru is the Transcendent Lord, the Supreme Lord God; He Himself is the Creator Lord.
Your servant begs for the dust of Your feet. I am a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. ||1||
O my Sovereign Lord, as You keep me, so do I remain.
When it pleases You, I chant Your Name. You alone can grant me peace. ||1||Pause||
Liberation, comfort and proper lifestyle come from serving You; You alone cause us to serve You.
That place is heaven, where the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises are sung. You Yourself instill faith into us. ||2||
Meditating, meditating, meditating in remembrance on the Naam, I live; my mind and body are enraptured.
I wash Your Lotus Feet, and drink in this water, O my True Guru, O Merciful to the meek. ||3||
I am a sacrifice to that most wonderful time when I came to Your Door.
God has become compassionate to Nanak; I have found the Perfect True Guru. ||4||8||55||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
When You come to mind, I am totally in bliss. One who forgets You might just as well be dead.
That being, whom You bless with Your Mercy, O Creator Lord, constantly meditates on You. ||1||
O my Lord and Master, You are the honor of the dishonored such as me.
I offer my prayer to You, God; listening, listening to the Word of Your Bani, I live. ||1||Pause||
May I become the dust of the feet of Your humble servants. I am a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan.
I enshrine Your Ambrosial Word within my heart. By Your Grace, I have found the Company of the Holy. ||2||
I place the state of my inner being before You; there is no other as great as You.
He alone is attached, whom You attach; he alone is Your devotee. ||3||
With my palms pressed together, I beg for this one gift; O my Lord and Master, if it pleases You, I shall obtain it.
With each and every breath, Nanak adores You; twenty-four hours a day, I sing Your Glorious Praises. ||4||9||56||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
When You stand over our heads, O Lord and Master, how can we suffer in pain?
The mortal being does not know how to chant Your Name - he is intoxicated with the wine of Maya, and the thought of death does not even enter his mind. ||1||
O my Sovereign Lord, You belong to the Saints, and the Saints belong to You.
