I am in bliss, meeting with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and now, my mind does not go wandering. ||1||
My burning desires are quenched, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, O mother.
The fever of doubt has been totally eliminated; meeting the Guru, I am cooled and soothed, with intuitive ease. ||1||Pause||
My wandering has ended, since I have realized the One and Only Lord; now, I have come to dwell in the eternal place.
Your Saints are the Saving Grace of the world; beholding the Blessed Vision of their Darshan, I remain satisfied. ||2||
I have left behind the sins of countless incarnations, now that I have grasped the feet of the eternal Holy Guru.
My mind sings the celestial melody of bliss and death shall no longer consume it. ||3||
My Lord, the Cause of all causes, is All-powerful, the Giver of peace; He is my Lord, my Lord King.
Nanak lives by chanting Your Name, O Lord; You are my helper, with me, through and through. ||4||9||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
The slanderer cries out and bewails.
He has forgotten the Supreme Lord, the Transcendent Lord; the slanderer reaps the rewards of his own actions. ||1||Pause||
If someone is his companion, then he shall be taken along with him.
Like the dragon, the slanderer carries his huge, useless loads, and burns in his own fire. ||1||
Nanak proclaims and announces what happens at the Door of the Transcendent Lord.
The humble devotees of the Lord are forever in bliss; singing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises, they blossom forth. ||2||10||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Even though I totally decorated myself,
still, my mind was not satisfied.
I applied various scented oils to my body,
and yet, I did not obtain even a tiny bit of pleasure from this.
Within my mind, I hold such a desire,
that I may live only to behold my Beloved, O my mother. ||1||
O mother, what should I do? This mind cannot rest.
It is bewitched by the tender love of my Beloved. ||1||Pause||
Garments, ornaments, and such exquisite pleasures -
I look upon these as of no account.
Likewise, honor, fame, dignity and greatness,
obedience by the whole world,
and a household as beautiful as a jewel.
If I am pleasing to God's Will, then I shall be blessed, and forever in bliss. ||2||
With foods and delicacies of so many different kinds,
and such abundant pleasures and entertainments,
power and property and absolute command -
with these, the mind is not satisfied, and its thirst is not quenched.
Without meeting Him, this day does not pass.
Meeting God, I find peace. ||3||
By searching and seeking, I have heard this news,
that without the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, no one swims across.
One who has this good destiny written upon his forehead, finds the True Guru.
His hopes are fulfilled, and his mind is satisfied.
When one meets God, then his thirst is quenched.
Nanak has found the Lord, within his mind and body. ||4||11||
