The True Guru is the Giver of the life of the soul, but the unfortunate ones do not love Him.
This opportunity shall not come into their hands again; in the end, they will suffer in torment and regret. ||7||
If a good person seeks goodness for himself, he should bow low in humble surrender to the Guru.
Nanak prays: please show kindness and compassion to me, O my Lord and Master, that I may apply the dust of the True Guru to my forehead. ||8||3||
Kaanraa, Fourth Mehl:
O mind, be attuned to His Love, and sing.
The Fear of God makes me fearless and immaculate; I am dyed in the color of the Guru's Teachings. ||1||Pause||
Those who are attuned to the Lord's Love remain balanced and detached forever; they live near the Lord, who comes into their house.
If I am blessed with the dust of their feet, then I live. Granting His Grace, He Himself bestows it. ||1||
Mortal beings are attached to greed and duality. Their minds are unripe and unfit, and will not accept the Dye of His Love.
But their lives are transformed through the Word of the Guru's Teachings. Meeting with the Guru, the Primal Being, they are dyed in the color of His Love. ||2||
There are ten organs of sense and action; the ten wander unrestrained. Under the influence of the three dispositions, they are not stable, even for an instant.
Coming in contact with the True Guru, they are brought under control; then, salvation and liberation are attained. ||3||
The One and Only Creator of the Universe is All-pervading everywhere. All shall once again merge into the One.
His One Form has one, and many colors; He leads all according to His One Word. ||4||
The Gurmukh realizes the One and Only Lord; He is revealed to the Gurmukh.
The Gurmukh goes and meets the Lord in His Mansion deep within; the Unstruck Word of the Shabad vibrates there. ||5||
God created all the beings and creatures of the universe; He blesses the Gurmukh with glory.
Without meeting the Guru, no one obtains the Mansion of His Presence. They suffer the agony of coming and going in reincarnation. ||6||
For countless lifetimes, I have been separated from my Beloved; in His Mercy, the Guru has united me with Him.
Meeting the True Guru, I have found absolute peace, and my polluted intellect blossoms forth. ||7||
O Lord, Har, Har, please grant Your Grace; O Life of the World, instill faith in the Naam within me.
Nanak is the Guru, the Guru, the True Guru; I am immersed in the Sanctuary of the True Guru. ||8||4||
Kaanraa, Fourth Mehl:
O mind, walk on the Path of the Guru's Teachings.
Just as the wild elephant is subdued by the prod, the mind is disciplined by the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||1||Pause||
The wandering mind wanders, roams and rambles in the ten directions; but the Guru holds it, and lovingly attunes it to the Lord.
The True Guru implants the Word of the Shabad deep within the heart; the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, trickles into the mouth. ||1||
The snakes are filled with poisonous venom; the Word of the Guru's Shabad is the antidote - place it in your mouth.
Maya, the serpent, does not even approach one who is rid of the poison, and lovingly attuned to the Lord. ||2||
The dog of greed is very powerful in the village of the body; the Guru strikes it and drives it out in an instant.
Truth, contentment, righteousness and Dharma have settled there; in the village of the Lord, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||3||
