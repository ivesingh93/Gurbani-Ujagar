The wedding songs of murder are sung, O Nanak, and blood is sprinkled instead of saffron, O Lalo. ||1||
Nanak sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord and Master in the city of corpses, and voices this account.
The One who created, and attached the mortals to pleasures, sits alone, and watches this.
The Lord and Master is True, and True is His justice. He issues His Commands according to His judgment.
The body-fabric will be torn apart into shreds, and then India will remember these words.
Coming in seventy-eight (1521 A.D.), they will depart in ninety-seven (1540 A.D.), and then another disciple of man will rise up.
Nanak speaks the Word of Truth; he proclaims the Truth at this, the right time. ||2||3||5||
Tilang, Fourth Mehl, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Everyone comes by Command of the Lord and Master. The Hukam of His Command extends to all.
True is the Lord and Master, and True is His play. The Lord is the Master of all. ||1||
So praise the True Lord; the Lord is the Master over all.
No one is equal to Him; am I of any account? ||Pause||
Air, water, earth and sky - the Lord has made these His home and temple.
He Himself is pervading everywhere, O Nanak. Tell me: what can be counted as false? ||2||1||
Tilang, Fourth Mehl:
The evil-minded person continually does fruitless deeds, all puffed up with pride.
When he brings home what he has acquired, by practicing deception and falsehood, he thinks that he has conquered the world. ||1||
Such is the drama of the world, that he does not contemplate the Lord's Name.
In an instant, all this false play shall perish; O my mind, meditate on the Lord. ||Pause||
He does not think of that time, when Death, the Torturer, shall come and seize him.
O Nanak, the Lord saves that one, within whose heart the Lord, in His Kind Mercy, dwells. ||2||2||
Tilang, Fifth Mehl, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The Lord infused His Light into the dust, and created the world, the universe.
The sky, the earth, the trees, and the water - all are the Creation of the Lord. ||1||
O human being, whatever you can see with your eyes, shall perish.
The world eats dead carcasses, living by neglect and greed. ||Pause||
Like a goblin, or a beast, they kill and eat the forbidden carcasses of meat.
So control your urges, or else you will be seized by the Lord, and thrown into the tortures of hell. ||2||
Your benefactors, presents, companions, courts, lands and homes -
when Azraa-eel, the Messenger of Death seizes you, what good will these be to you then? ||3||
The Pure Lord God knows your condition.
O Nanak, recite your prayer to the holy people. ||4||1||
Tilang, Second House, Fifth Mehl:
There is no other than You, Lord.
You are the Creator; whatever You do, that alone happens.
You are the strength, and You are the support of the mind.
Forever and ever, meditate, O Nanak, on the One. ||1||
The Great Giver is the Supreme Lord God over all.
You are our support, You are our sustainer. ||Pause||
