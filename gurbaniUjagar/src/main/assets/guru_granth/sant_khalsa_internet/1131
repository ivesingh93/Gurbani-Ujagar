Through the Naam, glorious greatness is obtained; he alone obtains it, whose mind is filled with the Lord. ||2||
Meeting the True Guru, the fruitful rewards are obtained. This true lifestyle beings sublime peace.
Those humble beings who are attached to the Lord are immaculate; they enshrine love for the Lord's Name. ||3||
If I obtain the dust of their feet, I apply it to my forehead. They meditate on the Perfect True Guru.
O Nanak, this dust is obtained only by perfect destiny. They focus their consciousness on the Lord's Name. ||4||3||13||
Bhairao, Third Mehl:
That humble being who contemplates the Word of the Shabad is true; the True Lord is within his heart.
If someone performs true devotional worship day and night, then his body will not feel pain. ||1||
Everyone calls him, "Devotee, devotee.
But without serving the True Guru, devotional worship is not obtained. Only through perfect destiny does one meet God. ||1||Pause||
The self-willed manmukhs lose their capital, and still, they demand profits. How can they earn any profit?
The Messenger of Death is always hovering above their heads. In the love of duality, they lose their honor. ||2||
Trying on all sorts of religious robes, they wander around day and night, but the disease of their egotism is not cured.
Reading and studying, they argue and debate; attached to Maya, they lose their awareness. ||3||
Those who serve the True Guru are blessed with the supreme status; through the Naam, they are blessed with glorious greatness.
O Nanak, those whose minds are filled with the Naam, are honored in the Court of the True Lord. ||4||4||14||
Bhairao, Third Mehl:
The self-willed manmukh cannot escape false hope. In the love of duality, he is ruined.
His belly is like a river - it is never filled up. He is consumed by the fire of desire. ||1||
Eternally blissful are those who are imbued with the sublime essence of the Lord.
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, fills their hearts, and duality runs away from their minds. Drinking in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord, Har, Har, they are satisfied. ||1||Pause||
The Supreme Lord God Himself created the Universe; He links each and every person to their tasks.
He Himself created love and attachment to Maya; He Himself attaches the mortals to duality. ||2||
If there were any other, then I would speak to him; all will be merged in You.
The Gurmukh contemplates the essence of spiritual wisdom; his light merges into the Light. ||3||
God is True, Forever True, and all His Creation is True.
O Nanak, the True Guru has given me this understanding; the True Name brings emancipation. ||4||5||15||
Bhairao, Third Mehl:
In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, those who do not realize the Lord are goblins. In the Golden Age of Sat Yuga, the supreme soul-swans contemplated the Lord.
In the Silver Age of Dwaapur Yuga, and the Brass Age of Traytaa Yuga, mankind prevailed, but only a rare few subdued their egos. ||1||
In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, glorious greatness is obtained through the Lord's Name.
In each and every age, the Gurmukhs know the One Lord; without the Name, liberation is not attained. ||1||Pause||
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is revealed in the heart of the True Lord's humble servant. It dwells in the mind of the Gurmukh.
Those who are lovingly focused on the Lord's Name save themselves; they save all their ancestors as well. ||2||
My Lord God is the Giver of virtue. The Word of the Shabad burns away all faults and demerits.
