but it is like the wind blowing in the ten directions. ||3||

Blessed, blessed is my Lord. ||3||
Nanak utters the Ambrosial Bani of the Lord.
Except the One Lord, he does not know any other at all. ||4||6||

The Lord is in front of me, and the Lord is behind me.
My Beloved Lord, the Source of Nectar, is in the middle as well. ||1||
God is my Shaastra and my favorable omen.
In His Home and Mansion, I find peace, poise and bliss. ||1||Pause||
Chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, with my tongue, and hearing it with my ears, I live.
Meditating, meditating in remembrance on God, I have become eternal, permanent and stable. ||2||
The pains of countless lifetimes have been erased.
The Unstruck Sound-current of the Shabad, the Word of God, vibrates in the Court of the Lord. ||3||
Granting His Grace, God has blended me with Himself.
Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of God. ||4||7||
Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
It brings millions of desires to fulfillment.
On the Path of Death, It will go with you and help you. ||1||
The Naam, the Name of the Lord of the Universe, is the holy water of the Ganges.
Whoever meditates on it, is saved; drinking it in, the mortal does not wander in reincarnation again. ||1||Pause||

Meditating in remembrance on the Naam, I have become free of desire. ||2||
It is my domain and empire, wealth, mansion and court.
Meditating in remembrance on the Naam brings perfect conduct. ||3||
Slave Nanak has deliberated, and has come to this conclusion:
Without the Lord's Name, everything is false and worthless, like ashes. ||4||8||

The poison had absolutely no harmful effect.
But the wicked Brahmin died in pain. ||1||

The face of the slanderer, here and hereafter, is blackened. ||3||

The filthy sinner lost hope and died. ||4||9||
Bhairao, Fifth Mehl:
Excellent, excellent, excellent, excellent, excellent is Your Name.
False, false, false, false is pride in the world. ||1||Pause||
The glorious vision of Your slaves, O Infinite Lord, is wonderful and beauteous.
