All desires are fulfilled, when the Inaccessible and Infinite Lord is obtained.
Guru Nanak has met the Supreme Lord God; I am a sacrifice to Your Feet. ||4||1||47||
Raag Soohee, Fifth Mehl, Seventh House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
He alone obeys Your Will, O Lord, unto whom You are Merciful.
That alone is devotional worship, which is pleasing to Your Will. You are the Cherisher of all beings. ||1||
O my Sovereign Lord, You are the Support of the Saints.
Whatever pleases You, they accept. You are the sustenance of their minds and bodies. ||1||Pause||
You are kind and compassionate, the treasure of mercy, the fulfiller of our hopes.
You are the Beloved Lord of life of all Your devotees; You are the Beloved of Your devotees. ||2||
You are unfathomable, infinite, lofty and exalted. There is no one else like You.
This is my prayer, O my Lord and Master; may I never forget You, O Peace-giving Lord. ||3||
Day and night, with each and every breath, I sing Your Glorious Praises, if it is pleasing to Your Will.
Nanak begs for the peace of Your Name, O Lord and Master; as it is pleasing to Your Will, I shall attain it. ||4||1||48||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
Where is that place, where You are never forgotten, Lord?
Twenty-four hours a day, they meditate on You, and their bodies become spotless and pure. ||1||
O my Lord, I have come searching for that place.
After seeking and searching, I found Sanctuary in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||1||Pause||
Reading and reciting the Vedas, Brahma grew weary, but he did not find even a tiny bit of God's worth.
The seekers and Siddhas wander around bewailing; they too are enticed by Maya. ||2||
There were ten regal incarnations of Vishnu; and then there was Shiva, the renunciate.
He did not find Your limits either, although he grew weary of smearing his body with ashes. ||3||
Peace, poise and bliss are found in the subtle essence of the Naam. The Lord's Saints sing the songs of joy.
I have obtained the Fruitful Vision of Guru Nanak's Darshan, and with my mind and body I meditate on the Lord, Har, Har. ||4||2||49||
Soohee, Fifth Mehl:
The religious rites, rituals and hypocrisies which are seen, are plundered by the Messenger of Death, the ultimate tax collector.
In the state of Nirvaanaa, sing the Kirtan of the Creator's Praises; contemplating Him in meditation, even for an instant, one is saved. ||1||
O Saints, cross over the world-ocean.
One who practices the Teachings of the Saints, by Guru's Grace, is carried across. ||1||Pause||
Millions of cleansing baths at sacred shrines of pilgrimage only fill the mortal with filth in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga.
One who sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, becomes spotlessly pure. ||2||
One may read all the books of the Vedas, the Bible, the Simritees and the Shaastras, but they will not bring liberation.
One who, as Gurmukh, chants the One Word, acquires a spotlessly pure reputation. ||3||
The four castes - the Kshatriyas, Brahmins, Soodras and Vaisyas - are equal in respect to the teachings.
