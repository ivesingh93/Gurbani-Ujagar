The Guru instructs His wandering Sikhs;
if they go astray, He sets them on the right path.
So serve the Guru, forever, day and night; He is the Destroyer of pain - He is with you as your companion. ||13||
O mortal being, what devotional worship have you performed to the Guru?
Even Brahma, Indra and Shiva do not know it.
Tell me, how can the unknowable True Guru be known? He alone attains this realization, whom the Lord forgives. ||14||
One who has love within, obtains the Blessed Vision of His Darshan.
One who enshrines love for the Word of the Guru's Bani, meets with Him.
Day and night, the Gurmukh sees the immaculate Divine Light everywhere; this lamp illuminates his heart. ||15||
The food of spiritual wisdom is the supremely sweet essence.
Whoever tastes it, sees the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan.
Beholding His Darshan, the unattached one meets the Lord; subduing the mind's desires, he merges into the Lord. ||16||
Those who serve the True Guru are supreme and famous.
Deep within each and every heart, they recognize God.
Please bless Nanak with the Lord's Praises, and the Sangat, the Congregation of the Lord's humble servants; through the True Guru, they know their Lord God. ||17||5||11||
Maaroo, First Mehl:
The True Lord is the Creator of the Universe.
He established and contemplates the worldly sphere.
He Himself created the creation, and beholds it; He is True and independent. ||1||
He created the beings of different kinds.
The two travelers have set out in two directions.
Without the Perfect Guru, no one is liberated. Chanting the True Name, one profits. ||2||
The self-willed manmukhs read and study, but they do not know the way.
They do not understand the Naam, the Name of the Lord; they wander, deluded by doubt.
They take bribes, and give false testimony; the noose of evil-mindedness is around their necks. ||3||
They read the Simritees, the Shaastras and the Puraanas;
they argue and debate, but do not know the essence of reality.
Without the Perfect Guru, the essence of reality is not obtained. The true and pure beings walk the Path of Truth. ||4||
All praise God and listen, and listen and speak.
He Himself is wise, and He Himself judges the Truth.
Those whom God blesses with His Glance of Grace become Gurmukh, and praise the Word of the Shabad. ||5||
Many listen and listen, and speak the Guru's Bani.
Listening and speaking, no one knows His limits.
He alone is wise, unto whom the unseen Lord reveals Himself; he speaks the Unspoken Speech. ||6||
At birth, the congratulations pour in;
the ignorant sing songs of joy.
Whoever is born, is sure to die, according to the destiny of past deeds inscribed upon his head by the Sovereign Lord King. ||7||
Union and separation were created by my God.
Creating the Universe, He gave it pain and pleasure.
The Gurmukhs remain unaffected by pain and pleasure; they wear the armor of humility. ||8||
The noble people are traders in Truth.
They purchase the true merchandise, contemplating the Guru.
One who has the wealth of the true commodity in his lap, is blessed with the rapture of the True Shabad. ||9||
The false dealings lead only to loss.
The trades of the Gurmukh are pleasing to God.
His stock is safe, and his capital is safe and sound. The noose of Death is cut away from around his neck. ||10||
