Dayv-Gandhaaree, Fifth Mehl:
I have looked in so many ways, but there is no other like the Lord.
On all the continents and islands, He is permeating and fully pervading; He is in all worlds. ||1||Pause||
He is the most unfathomable of the unfathomable; who can chant His Praises? My mind lives by hearing news of Him.
People in the four stages of life, and in the four social classes are liberated, by serving You, Lord. ||1||
The Guru has implanted the Word of His Shabad within me; I have attained the supreme status. My sense of duality has been dispelled, and now, I am at peace.
Says Nanak, I have easily crossed over the terrifying world-ocean, obtaining the treasure of the Lord's Name. ||2||2||33||
Raag Dayv-Gandhaaree, Fifth Mehl, Sixth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Know that there is One and only One Lord.
O Gurmukh, know that He is One. ||1||Pause||
Why are you wandering around? O Siblings of Destiny, don't wander around; He is permeating and pervading everywhere. ||1||
As the fire in the forest, without control, cannot serve any purpose -
just so, without the Guru, one cannot attain the Gate of the Lord.
Joining the Society of the Saints, renounce your ego; says Nanak, in this way, the supreme treasure is obtained. ||2||1||34||
Dayv-Gandhaaree, Fifth Mehl:
His state cannot be known. ||1||Pause||
How can I behold Him through clever tricks? Those who tell this story are wonder-struck and amazed. ||1||
The servants of God, the celestial singers, the Siddhas and the seekers,
the angelic and divine beings, Brahma and those like Brahma,
and the four Vedas proclaim, day and night,
that the Lord and Master is inaccessible, unapproachable and unfathomable.
Endless, endless are His Glories, says Nanak; they cannot be described - they are beyond our reach. ||2||2||35||
Dayv-Gandhaaree, Fifth Mehl:
I meditate, and sing of the Creator Lord.
I have become fearless, and I have found peace, poise and bliss, remembering the infinite Lord. ||1||Pause||
The Guru, of the most fruitful image, has placed His hand upon my forehead.
Wherever I look, there, I find Him with me.
The Lotus Feet of the Lord are the Support of my very breath of life. ||1||
My God is all-powerful, unfathomable and utterly vast.
The Lord and Master is close at hand - He dwells in each and every heart.
Nanak seeks the Sanctuary and the Support of God, who has no end or limitation. ||2||3||36||
Dayv-Gandhaaree, Fifth Mehl:
Turn away, O my mind, turn away.
Turn away from the faithless cynic.
False is the love of the false one; break the ties, O my mind, and your ties shall be broken. Break your ties with the faithless cynic. ||1||Pause||
One who enters a house filled with soot is blackened.
RÃ¼n far away from such people! One who meets the Guru escapes from the bondage of the three dispositions. ||1||
I beg this blessing of You, O Merciful Lord, ocean of mercy - please, don't bring me face to face with the faithless cynics.
