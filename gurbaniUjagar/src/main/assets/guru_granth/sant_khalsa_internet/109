Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
One who asks for a false gift,
shall not take even an instant to die.
But one who continually serves the Supreme Lord God and meets the Guru, is said to be immortal. ||1||
One whose mind is dedicated to loving devotional worship
sings His Glorious Praises night and day, and remains forever awake and aware.
Taking him by the hand, the Lord and Master merges into Himself that person, upon whose forehead such destiny is written. ||2||
His Lotus Feet dwell in the minds of His devotees.
Without the Transcendent Lord, all are plundered.
I long for the dust of the feet of His humble servants. The Name of the True Lord is my decoration. ||3||
Standing up and sitting down, I sing the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
Meditating in remembrance on Him, I obtain my Eternal Husband Lord.
God has become merciful to Nanak. I cheerfully accept Your Will. ||4||43||50||
Raag Maajh, Ashtapadees: First Mehl, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
By His Command, all are attuned to the Word of the Shabad,
and all are called to the Mansion of His Presence, the True Court of the Lord.
O my True Lord and Master, Merciful to the meek, my mind is pleased and appeased by the Truth. ||1||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who are adorned with the Word of the Shabad.
The Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, is forever the Giver of Peace. Through the Guru's Teachings, it dwells in the mind. ||1||Pause||
No one is mine, and I am no one else's.
The True Lord and Master of the three worlds is mine.
Acting in egotism, so very many have died. After making mistakes, they later repent and regret. ||2||
Those who recognize the Hukam of the Lord's Command chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they are glorified with the Naam.
Everyone's account is kept in the True Court, and through the Beauty of the Naam, they are saved. ||3||
The self-willed manmukhs are deluded; they find no place of rest.
Bound and gagged at Death's Door, they are brutally beaten.
Without the Name, there are no companions or friends. Liberation comes only by meditating on the Naam. ||4||
The false shaaktas, the faithless cynics, do not like the Truth.
Bound by duality, they come and go in reincarnation.
No one can erase pre-recorded destiny; the Gurmukhs are liberated. ||5||
In this world of her parents' house, the young bride did not know her Husband.
Through falsehood, she has been separated from Him, and she cries out in misery.
Defrauded by demerits, she does not find the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. But through virtuous actions, her demerits are forgiven. ||6||
She, who knows her Beloved in her parents' house,
as Gurmukh, comes to understand the essence of reality; she contemplates her Lord.
Her comings and goings cease, and she is absorbed in the True Name. ||7||
The Gurmukhs understand and describe the Indescribable.
True is our Lord and Master; He loves the Truth.
Nanak offers this true prayer: singing His Glorious Praises, I merge with the True One. ||8||1||
Maajh, Third Mehl, First House:
By His Mercy, we meet the True Guru.
