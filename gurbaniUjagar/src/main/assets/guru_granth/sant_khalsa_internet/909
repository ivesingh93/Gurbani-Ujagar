This is not Yoga, O Yogi, to abandon your family and wander around.
The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is within the household of the body. By Guru's Grace, you shall find your Lord God. ||8||
This world is a puppet of clay, Yogi; the terrible disease, the desire for Maya is in it.
Making all sorts of efforts, and wearing religious robes, Yogi, this disease cannot be cured. ||9||
The Name of the Lord is the medicine, Yogi; the Lord enshrines it in the mind.
One who becomes Gurmukh understands this; he alone finds the Way of Yoga. ||10||
The Path of Yoga is very difficult, Yogi; he alone finds it, whom God blesses with His Grace.
Inside and outside, he sees the One Lord; he eliminates doubt from within himself. ||11||
So play the harp which vibrates without being played, Yogi.
Says Nanak, thus you shall be liberated, Yogi, and remain merged in the True Lord. ||12||1||10||
Raamkalee, Third Mehl:
The treasure of devotional worship is revealed to the Gurmukh; the True Guru has inspired me to understand this understanding. ||1||
O Saints, the Gurmukh is blessed with glorious greatness. ||1||Pause||
Dwelling always in Truth, celestial peace wells up; sexual desire and anger are eliminated from within. ||2||
Eradicating self-conceit, remain lovingly focused on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; through the Word of the Shabad, burn away possessiveness. ||3||
By Him we are created, and by Him we are destroyed; in the end, the Naam will be our only help and support. ||4||
He is ever-present; don't think that He is far away. He created the creation. ||5||
Deep within your heart, chant the True Word of the Shabad; remain lovingly absorbed in the True Lord. ||6||
The Priceless Naam is in the Society of the Saints; by great good fortune, it is obtained. ||7||
Do not be deluded by doubt; serve the True Guru, and keep your mind steady in one place. ||8||
Without the Name, everyone wanders around in confusion; they waste away their lives in vain. ||9||
Yogi, you have lost the Way; you wander around confused. Through hypocrisy, Yoga is not attained. ||10||
Sitting in Yogic postures in the City of God, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, you shall find Yoga. ||11||
Restrain your restless wanderings through the Shabad, and the Naam will come to dwell in your mind. ||12||
This body is a pool, O Saints; bathe in it, and enshrine love for the Lord. ||13||
Those who cleanse themselves through the Naam, are the most immaculate people; through the Shabad, they wash off their filth. ||14||
Trapped by the three qualities, the unconscious person does not think of the Naam; without the Name, he wastes away. ||15||
The three forms of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are trapped in the three qualities, lost in confusion. ||16||
By Guru's Grace, this triad is eradicated, and one is lovingly absorbed in the fourth state. ||17||
The Pandits, the religious scholars, read, study and discuss the arguments; they do not understand. ||18||
Engrossed in corruption, they wander in confusion; who can they possibly instruct, O Siblings of Destiny? ||19||
The Bani, the Word of the humble devotee is the most sublime and exalted; it prevails throughout the ages. ||20||
One who is committed to this Bani is emancipated, and through the Shabad, merges in Truth. ||21||
