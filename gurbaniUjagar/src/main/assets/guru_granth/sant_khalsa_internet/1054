The Perfect True Guru has imparted this understanding.
I have enshrined the Naam, the One Name, within my mind.
I chant the Naam, and meditate on the Naam. Singing His Glorious Praises, I enter the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. ||11||
The servant serves, and obeys the Command of the Infinite Lord.
The self-willed manmukhs do not know the value of the Lord's Command.
By the Hukam of the Lord's Command, one is exalted; by His Hukam, one is glorified; by His Hukam, one becomes carefree. ||12||
By Guru's Grace, one recognizes the Lord's Hukam.
The wandering mind is restrained, and brought back to the home of the One Lord.
Imbued with the Naam, one remains forever detached; the jewel of the Naam rests within the mind. ||13||
The One Lord is pervasive throughout all the world.
By Guru's Grace, He is revealed.
Those humble beings who praise the Shabad are immaculate; they dwell within the home of their own inner self. ||14||
The devotees abide forever in Your Sanctuary, Lord.
You are inaccessible and unfathomable; Your value cannot be estimated.
As it pleases Your Will, You keep us; the Gurmukh meditates on the Naam. ||15||
Forever and ever, I sing Your Glorious Praises.
O my True Lord and Master, may I become pleasing to Your Mind.
Nanak offers this true prayer: O Lord, please bless me with Truth, that I may merge in the Truth. ||16||1||10||
Maaroo, Third Mehl:
Those who serve the True Guru are very fortunate.
Night and day, they remain lovingly attuned to the True Name.
The Lord, the Giver of peace, abides forever deep within their hearts; they delight in the True Word of the Shabad. ||1||
When the Lord grants His Grace, one meets with the Guru.
The Name of the Lord is enshrined within the mind.
The Lord, the Giver of peace, abides forever within the mind; the mind is delighted with the Word of the Shabad. ||2||
When the Lord bestows His Mercy, He unites in His Union.
Egotism and attachment are burned away by the Shabad.
In the Love of the One Lord, one remains liberated forever; he is not in conflict with anyone. ||3||
Without serving the True Guru, there is only pitch-black darkness.
Without the Shabad, no one crosses over to the other side.
Those who are imbued with the Shabad, are very detached. They earn the profit of the True Word of the Shabad. ||4||
Pain and pleasure are pre-ordained by the Creator.
He Himself has caused the love of duality to be pervasive.
One who becomes Gurmukh remains detached; how can anyone trust the self-willed manmukh? ||5||
Those who do not recognize the Shabad are manmukhs.
They do not know the essence of the Fear of the Guru.
Without this Fear, how can anyone find the Fearless True Lord? The Messenger of Death will pull the breath out. ||6||
The invulnerable Messenger of Death cannot be killed.
The Word of the Guru's Shabad prevents him from approaching.
When he hears the Word of the Shabad, he runs far away. He is afraid that the self-sufficient Dear Lord will kill him. ||7||
The Dear Lord is the RÃ¼ler above all.
What can this wretched Messenger of Death do?
As slave to the Hukam of the Lord's Command, the mortal acts according to His Hukam. According to His Hukam, he is deprived of his breath. ||8||
The Gurmukh realizes that the True Lord created the creation.
The Gurmukh knows that the Lord has expanded the entire expanse.
One who becomes Gurmukh, understands the True Lord. Through the True Word of the Shabad, he finds peace. ||9||
The Gurmukh knows that the Lord is the Architect of karma.
