Bow in humility to the lotus feet of the Guru.
Eliminate sexual desire and anger from this body.
Be the dust of all,
and see the Lord in each and every heart, in all. ||1||
In this way, dwell upon the Lord of the World, the Lord of the Universe.
My body and wealth belong to God; my soul belongs to God. ||1||Pause||
Twenty-four hours a day, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
This is the purpose of human life.
Renounce your egotistical pride, and know that God is with you.
By the Grace of the Holy, let your mind be imbued with the Lord's Love. ||2||
Know the One who created you,
and in the world hereafter you shall be honored in the Court of the Lord.
Your mind and body will be immaculate and blissful;
chant the Name of the Lord of the Universe with your tongue. ||3||
Grant Your Kind Mercy, O my Lord, Merciful to the meek.
My mind begs for the dust of the feet of the Holy.
Be merciful, and bless me with this gift,
that Nanak may live, chanting God's Name. ||4||11||13||
Gond, Fifth Mehl:
My incense and lamps are my service to the Lord.
Time and time again, I humbly bow to the Creator.
I have renounced everything, and grasped the Sanctuary of God.
By great good fortune, the Guru has become pleased and satisfied with me. ||1||
Twenty-four hours a day, I sing of the Lord of the Universe.
My body and wealth belong to God; my soul belongs to God. ||1||Pause||
Chanting the Glorious Praises of the Lord, I am in bliss.
The Supreme Lord God is the Perfect Forgiver.
Granting His Mercy, He has linked His humble servants to His service.
He has rid me of the pains of birth and death, and merged me with Himself. ||2||
This is the essence of karma, righteous conduct and spiritual wisdom,
to chant the Lord's Name in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
God's Feet are the boat to cross over the world-ocean.
God, the Inner-knower, is the Cause of causes. ||3||
Showering His Mercy, He Himself has saved me.
The five hideous demons have run away.
Do not lose your life in the gamble.
The Creator Lord has taken Nanak's side. ||4||12||14||
Gond, Fifth Mehl:
In His Mercy, He has blessed me with peace and bliss.
The Divine Guru has saved His child.
God is kind and compassionate; He is the Lord of the Universe.
He forgives all beings and creatures. ||1||
I seek Your Sanctuary, O God, O Merciful to the meek.
Meditating on the Supreme Lord God, I am forever in ecstasy. ||1||Pause||
There is no other like the Merciful Lord God.
He is contained deep within each and every heart.
He embellishes His slave, here and hereafter.
It is Your nature, God, to purify sinners. ||2||
Meditation on the Lord of the Universe is the medicine to cure millions of illnesses.
My Tantra and Mantra is to meditate, to vibrate upon the Lord God.
Illnesses and pains are dispelled, meditating on God.
The fruits of the mind's desires are fulfilled. ||3||
He is the Cause of causes, the All-powerful Merciful Lord.
Contemplating Him is the greatest of all treasures.
God Himself has forgiven Nanak;
forever and ever, he chants the Name of the One Lord. ||4||13||15||
Gond, Fifth Mehl:
Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my friend.
