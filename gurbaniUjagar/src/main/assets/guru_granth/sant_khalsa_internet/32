Practicing egotism, selfishness and conceit, she wanders around the world, but her wealth and property will not go with her.
The spiritually blind do not even think of the Naam; they are all bound and gagged by the Messenger of Death.
Meeting the True Guru, the wealth is obtained, contemplating the Name of the Lord in the heart. ||3||
Those who are attuned to the Naam are immaculate and pure; through the Guru, they obtain intuitive peace and poise.
Their minds and bodies are dyed in the Color of the Lord's Love, and their tongues savor His Sublime Essence.
O Nanak, that Primal Color which the Lord has applied, shall never fade away. ||4||14||47||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
By His Grace one becomes Gurmukh, worshipping the Lord with devotion. Without the Guru there is no devotional worship.
Those whom He unites with Himself, understand and become pure.
The Dear Lord is True, and True is the Word of His Bani. Through the Shabad, we merge with Him. ||1||
O Siblings of Destiny: those who lack devotion-why have they even bothered to come into the world?
They do not serve the Perfect Guru; they waste away their lives in vain. ||1||Pause||
The Lord Himself, the Life of the World, is the Giver of Peace. He Himself forgives, and unites with Himself.
So what about all these poor beings and creatures? What can anyone say?
He Himself blesses the Gurmukh with glory. He Himself enjoins us to His Service. ||2||
Gazing upon their families, people are lured and trapped by emotional attachment, but none will go along with them in the end.
Serving the True Guru, one finds the Lord, the Treasure of Excellence. His Value cannot be estimated.
The Lord God is my Friend and Companion. God shall be my Helper and Support in the end. ||3||
Within your conscious mind, you may say anything, but without the Guru, selfishness is not removed.
The Dear Lord is the Giver, the Lover of His devotees. By His Grace, He comes to dwell in the mind.
O Nanak, by His Grace, He bestows enlightened awareness; God Himself blesses the Gurmukh with glorious greatness. ||4||15||48||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Blessed is the mother who gave birth and blessed and respected is the father of one,
who serves the True Guru, finds peace and his arrogant pride is banished from within.
Standing at the Lord's Door, the humble Saints serve Him; they find the Treasure of Excellence. ||1||
O my mind, become Gurmukh, and meditate on the Lord.
The Word of the Guru's Shabad abides within the mind, and the body and mind become pure. ||1||Pause||
By His Grace, He has come into my home; He Himself has come to meet me.
Singing His Praises through the Shabads of the Guru, we are dyed in His Color with intuitive ease.
Becoming truthful, we merge with the True One; remaining blended with Him, we shall never be separated again. ||2||
Whatever is to be done, the Lord is doing. No one else can do anything.
Those separated from Him for so long are reunited with Him once again by the True Guru, who takes them into His Own Account.
He Himself assigns all to their tasks; nothing else can be done. ||3||
One whose mind and body are imbued with the Lord's Love gives up egotism and corruption.
Day and night, the Name of the One Lord, the Fearless and Formless One, dwells within the heart.
O Nanak, He blends us with Himself, through the Perfect, Infinite Word of His Shabad. ||4||16||49||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
The Lord of the Universe is the Treasure of Excellence; His limits cannot be found.
He is not obtained by mouthing mere words, but by rooting out ego from within.
