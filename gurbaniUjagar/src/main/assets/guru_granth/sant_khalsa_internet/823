Such is the sublime essence of the Lord, that I cannot describe it. The Perfect Guru has turned me away from the world. ||1||
I behold the Fascinating Lord with everyone. No one is without Him - He is pervading everywhere.
The Perfect Lord, the treasure of mercy, is permeating everywhere. Says Nanak, I am fully fulfilled. ||2||7||93||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
What does the mind say? What can I say?
You are wise and all-knowing, O God, my Lord and Master; what can I say to You? ||1||Pause||
You know even what is not said, whatever is in the soul.
O mind, why do you deceive others? How long will you do this? The Lord is with you; He hears and sees everything. ||1||
Knowing this, my mind has become blissful; there is no other Creator.
Says Nanak, the Guru has become kind to me; my love for the Lord shall never wear off. ||2||8||94||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Thus, the slanderer crumbles away.
This is the distinctive sign - listen, O Siblings of Destiny: he collapses like a wall of sand. ||1||Pause||
When the slanderer sees a fault in someone else, he is pleased. Seeing goodness, he is depressed.
Twenty-four hours a day, he plots, but nothing works. The evil man dies, constantly thinking up evil plans. ||1||
The slanderer forgets God, death approaches him, and he starts to argue with the humble servant of the Lord.
God Himself, the Lord and Master, is Nanak's protector. What can any wretched person do to him? ||2||9||95||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Why do you wander in delusion like this?
You act, and incite others to act, and then deny it. The Lord is always with you; He sees and hears everything. ||1||Pause||
You purchase glass, and discard gold; you are in love with your enemy, while you renounce your true friend.
That which exists, seems bitter; that which does not exist, seems sweet to you. Engrossed in corruption, you are burning away. ||1||
The mortal has fallen into the deep, dark pit, and is entangled in the darkness of doubt, and the bondage of emotional attachment.
Says Nanak, when God becomes merciful, one meets with the Guru, who takes him by the arm, and lifts him out. ||2||10||96||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
With my mind, body and tongue, I remember the Lord.
I am in ecstasy, and my anxieties are dispelled; the Guru has blessed me with total peace. ||1||Pause||
My ignorance has been totally transformed into wisdom. My God is wise and all-knowing.
Giving me His Hand, He saved me, and now no one can harm me at all. ||1||
I am a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of the Holy; by their Grace, I contemplate the Lord's Name.
Says Nanak, I place my faith in my Lord and Master; within my mind, I do not believe in any other, even for an instant. ||2||11||97||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
The Perfect Guru has saved me.
He has enshrined the Ambrosial Name of the Lord within my heart, and the filth of countless incarnations has been washed away. ||1||Pause||
The demons and wicked enemies are driven out, by meditating, and chanting the Chant of the Perfect Guru.
