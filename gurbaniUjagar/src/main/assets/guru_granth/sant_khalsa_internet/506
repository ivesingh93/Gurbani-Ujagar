The Name of the Lord, the most pure and sacred, is within my heart; this body is Your Sanctuary, Lord. ||7||
The waves of greed and avarice are subdued, by treasuring the Lord's Name in the mind.
Subdue my mind, O Pure Immaculate Lord; says Nanak, I have entered Your Sanctuary. ||8||1||5||
Goojaree, Third Mehl, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
I dance, and make this mind dance as well.
By Guru's Grace, I eliminate my self-conceit.
One who keeps his consciousness focused on the Lord is liberated; he obtains the fruits of his desires. ||1||
So dance, O mind, before your Guru.
If you dance according to the Guru's Will, you shall obtain peace, and in the end, the fear of death shall leave you. ||Pause||
One whom the Lord Himself causes to dance, is called a devotee. He Himself links us to His Love.
He Himself sings, He Himself listens, and He puts this blind mind on the right path. ||2||
One who dances night and day, and banishes Shakti's Maya, enters the House of the Lord Shiva, where there is no sleep.
The world is asleep in Maya, the house of Shakti; it dances, jumps and sings in duality. The self-willed manmukh has no devotion. ||3||
The angels, mortals, renunciates, ritualists, silent sages and beings of spiritual wisdom dance.
The Siddhas and seekers, lovingly focused on the Lord, dance, as do the Gurmukhs, whose minds dwell in reflective meditation. ||4||
The planets and solar systems dance in the three qualities, as do those who bear love for You, Lord.
The beings and creatures all dance, and the four sources of creation dance. ||5||
They alone dance, who are pleasing to You, and who, as Gurmukhs, embrace love for the Word of the Shabad.
They are devotees, with the essence of spiritual wisdom, who obey the Hukam of His Command. ||6||
This is devotional worship, that one loves the True Lord; without service, one cannot be a devotee.
If one remains dead while yet alive, he reflects upon the Shabad, and then, he obtains the True Lord. ||7||
So many people dance for the sake of Maya; how rare are those who contemplate reality.
By Guru's Grace, that humble being obtains You, Lord, upon whom You show Mercy. ||8||
If I forget the True Lord, even for an instant, that time passes in vain.
With each and every breath, constantly remember the Lord; He Himself shall forgive you, according to His Will. ||9||
They alone dance, who are pleasing to Your Will, and who, as Gurmukhs, contemplate the Word of the Shabad.
Says Nanak, they alone find celestial peace, whom You bless with Your Grace. ||10||1||6||
Goojaree, Fourth Mehl, Second House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Without the Lord, my soul cannot survive, like an infant without milk.
The inaccessible and incomprehensible Lord God is obtained by the Gurmukh; I am a sacrifice to my True Guru. ||1||
O my mind, the Kirtan of the Lord's Praise is a boat to carry you across.
The Gurmukhs obtain the Ambrosial Water of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. You bless them with Your Grace. ||Pause||
