Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
Infatuated with the darkness of emotional attachment to Maya, he does not know the Lord, the Great Giver.
The Lord created his body and fashioned his soul, but he claims that his power is his own. ||1||
O foolish mind, God, your Lord and Master is watching over you.
Whatever you do, He knows; nothing can remain concealed from Him. ||Pause||
You are intoxicated with the tastes of the tongue, with greed and pride; countless sins spring from these.
You wandered in pain through countless incarnations, weighed down by the chains of egotism. ||2||

When Chitr and Gupt, the celestial accountants of the conscious and subconscious, call for your account, who will screen you then? ||3||
O Perfect Lord, Merciful to the meek, Destroyer of pain, without You, I have no shelter at all.
Please, lift me up out of the world-ocean; O God, I have come to Your Sanctuary. ||4||15||26||

Singing the Glorious Praises of the immovable and imperishable Lord, one remains awake to the Lord's Love, day and night. ||3||
He obtains the fruits of his mind's desires, listening to the comforting sermon of the Lord.
In the beginning, in the middle, and in the end, God is Nanak's best friend. ||4||16||27||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl, Panch-Padas:
May my emotional attachment, my sense of mine and yours, and my self-conceit be dispelled. ||1||
O Saints, show me such a way,
by which my egotism and pride might be eliminated. ||1||Pause||
I see the Supreme Lord God in all beings, and I am the dust of all. ||2||
I see God always with me, and the wall of doubt has been shattered. ||3||
