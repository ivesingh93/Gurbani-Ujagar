The rays of light spread out, and the heart-lotus joyfully blossoms forth; the sun enters into the house of the moon.
I have conquered death; the desires of the mind are destroyed. By Guru's Grace, I have found God. ||3||
I am dyed in the deep crimson color of His Love. I am not colored by any other color.
O Nanak, my tongue is saturated with the taste of God, who is permeating and pervading everywhere. ||4||15||
Prabhaatee, First Mehl:
The Yogis are divided into twelve schools, the Sannyaasees into ten.
The Yogis and those wearing religious robes, and the Jains with their all hair plucked out - without the Word of the Shabad, the noose is around their necks. ||1||
Those who are imbued with the Shabad are the perfectly detached renunciates.
They beg to receive charity in the hands of their hearts, embracing love and affection for the One. ||1||Pause||
The Brahmins study and argue about the scriptures; they perform ceremonial rituals, and lead others in these rituals.
Without true understanding, those self-willed manmukhs understand nothing. Separated from God, they suffer in pain. ||2||
Those who receive the Shabad are sanctified and pure; they are approved in the True Court.
Night and day, they remain lovingly attuned to the Naam; throughout the ages, they are merged in the True One. ||3||
Good deeds, righteousness and Dharmic faith, purification, austere self-discipline, chanting, intense meditation and pilgrimages to sacred shrines - all these abide in the Shabad.
O Nanak, united in union with the True Guru, suffering, sin and death run away. ||4||16||
Prabhaatee, First Mehl:
The dust of the feet of the Saints, the Company of the Holy, and the Praises of the Lord carry us across to the other side.
What can the wretched, terrified Messenger of Death do to the Gurmukhs? The Lord abides in their hearts. ||1||
Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, life might just as well be burnt down.
The Gurmukh chants and meditates on the Lord, chanting the chant on the mala; the Flavor of the Lord comes into the mind. ||1||Pause||
Those who follow the Guru's Teachings find true peace - how can I even describe the glory of such a person?
The Gurmukh seeks and finds the gems and jewels, diamonds, rubies and treasures. ||2||
So center yourself on the treasures of spiritual wisdom and meditation; remain lovingly attuned to the One True Lord, and the Word of His Shabad.
Remain absorbed in the Primal State of the Fearless, Immaculate, Independent, Self-sufficient Lord. ||3||
The seven seas are overflowing with the Immaculate Water; the inverted boat floats across.
The mind which wandered in external distractions is restrained and held in check; the Gurmukh is intuitively absorbed in God. ||4||
He is a householder, he is a renunciate and God's slave, who, as Gurmukh, realizes his own self.
Says Nanak, his mind is pleased and appeased by the True Word of the Shabad; there is no other at all. ||5||17||
Raag Prabhaatee, Third Mehl, Chau-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Those who become Gurmukh and understand are very rare; God is permeating and pervading through the Word of His Shabad.
Those who are imbued with the Naam, the Name of the Lord, find everlasting peace; they remain lovingly attuned to the True One. ||1||
