God is your Husband; He is Handsome and True. He is obtained by reflecting upon the Guru. ||1||Pause||
The self-willed manmukhs do not recognize their Husband Lord; how will they spend their life-night?

They enjoy their Husband Lord forever, and their life-night passes in the most blissful peace. ||2||
She is utterly lacking in spiritual wisdom; she is abandoned by her Husband Lord. She cannot obtain His Love.
In the darkness of intellectual ignorance, she cannot see her Husband, and her hunger does not depart.

She who meets the True Guru, by perfect good fortune, finds her Husband; she is absorbed in the True One. ||3||

Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Some enjoy their Husband Lord; unto whose door should I go to ask for Him?
I serve my True Guru with love, that He may lead me to Union with my Husband Lord.
He created all, and He Himself watches over us. Some are close to Him, and some are far away.
She who knows her Husband Lord to be always with her, enjoys His Constant Presence. ||1||

Night and day, you shall enjoy your Husband, and you shall intuitively merge into the True One. ||1||Pause||

Upon her beautiful and cozy bed, she enjoys the Love of her Lord. She is overflowing with the treasure of devotion.
That Beloved God abides in her mind; He gives His Support to all. ||2||
I am forever a sacrifice to those who praise their Husband Lord.
I dedicate my mind and body to them, and give my head as well; I fall at their feet.

The Gurmukh recognizes the Naam, O Nanak, and is absorbed into the True One. ||3||29||62||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
O Dear Lord, You are the Truest of the True. All things are in Your Power.
The 8.4 million species of beings wander around searching for You, but without the Guru, they do not find You.
When the Dear Lord grants His Forgiveness, this human body finds lasting peace.
By Guru's Grace, I serve the True One, who is Immeasurably Deep and Profound. ||1||
O my mind, attuned to the Naam, you shall find peace.
Follow the Guru's Teachings, and praise the Naam; there is no other at all. ||1||Pause||

Those evil souls, ensnared by the love of duality, are subject to Your Command.
The souls on their spiritual journey chant and meditate within their minds on the One Lord, the Treasure of Excellence.
