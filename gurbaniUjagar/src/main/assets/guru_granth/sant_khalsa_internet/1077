Some are hungry and some are satisfied and satiated, but all lean on Your Support. ||3||
The True Lord Himself is True, True, True.
He is woven into the essence of His devotees, through and through.
He Himself is hidden, and He Himself is revealed. He Himself spreads Himself out. ||4||
Forever, forever and ever, He shall always exist.
He is lofty, inaccessible, unfathomable and infinite.
He fills the empty, and empties out the filled; such are the plays and dramas of my Lord and Master. ||5||
With my mouth, I praise my True Lord King.
With my eyes, I behold the inaccessible and unfathomable Lord.
Listening, listening with my ears, my mind and body are rejuvenated; my Lord and Master saves all. ||6||
He created the creation, and gazes upon what He has created.
All beings and creatures meditate on Him.
He Himself knows His creative power; He blesses with His Glance of Grace. ||7||
Where the Saints gather together and sit, God dwells close at hand.
They abide in bliss and joy, beholding the Lord's wondrous play.
They sing the Glories of the Lord, and the unstruck sound current of His Bani; O Nanak, His slaves remain conscious of Him. ||8||
Coming and going is all Your wondrous play.
Creating the Creation, You gaze upon Your infinite play.
Creating the Creation, You Yourself cherish and nurture it. ||9||
Listening, listening to Your Glory, I live.
Forever and ever, I am a sacrifice to You.
With my palms pressed together, I meditate in remembrance on You, day and night, O my inaccessible, infinite Lord and Master. ||10||
Other than You, who else should I praise?
I meditate on the One and Only Lord within my mind.
Realizing the Hukam of Your Will, Your humble servants are enraptured; this is the achievement of Your devotees. ||11||
Following the Guru's Teachings, I meditate on the True Lord within my mind.
Following the Guru's Teachings, I am immersed in the Lord's Love.
Following the Guru's Teachings, all bonds are broken, and this doubt and emotional attachment are burnt away. ||12||
Wherever He keeps me, is my place of rest.
Whatever naturally happens, I accept that as good.
Hatred is gone - I have no hatred at all; I see the One Lord in all. ||13||
Fear has been removed, and darkness has been dispelled.
The all-powerful, primal, detached Lord God has been revealed.
Forsaking self-conceit, I have entered His Sanctuary, and I work for Him. ||14||
Rare are those few, very blessed people, who come into the world,
and meditate on their Lord and Master, twenty-four hours a day.
Associating with such humble people, all are saved, and their families are saved as well. ||15||
This is the blessing which I have received from my Lord and Master.
Twenty-four hours a day, with my palms pressed together, I meditate on Him.
I chant the Naam, and through the Naam, I intuitively merge into the Lord; O Nanak, may I be blessed with the Naam, and ever repeat it. ||16||1||6||
Maaroo, Fifth Mehl:
Do not be fooled by appearances, you fool.
This is a false attachment to the expanse of an illusion.
No one can remain in this world; only the One Lord is permanent and unchanging. ||1||
Seek the Sanctuary of the Perfect Guru.
He shall eradicate all emotional attachment, sorrow and doubt.
He shall administer the medicine, the Mantra of the One Name. Sing the True Name within your heart. ||2||
