Nanak, the slave of Your slaves, says, I am the water-carrier of Your slaves. ||8||1||
Nat, Fourth Mehl:
O Lord, I am an unworthy stone.
The Merciful Lord, in His Mercy, has led me to meet the Guru; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, this stone is carried across. ||1||Pause||
The True Guru has implanted within me the exceedingly sweet Naam, the Name of the Lord; it is like the most fragrant sandalwood.
Through the Name, my awareness extends in the ten directions; the fragrance of the fragrant Lord permeates the air. ||1||
Your unlimited sermon is the most sweet sermon; I contemplate the most Sublime Word of the Guru.
Singing, singing, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord; singing His Glorious Praises, the Guru saves me. ||2||
The Guru is wise and clear; the Guru looks upon all alike. Meeting with Him, doubt and skepticism are removed.
Meeting with the True Guru, I have obtained the supreme status. I am a sacrifice to the True Guru. ||3||
Practicing hypocrisy and deception, people wander around in confusion. Greed and hypocrisy are evils in this world.
In this world and the next, they are miserable; the Messenger of Death hovers over their heads, and strikes them down. ||4||
At the break of day, they take care of their affairs, and the poisonous entanglements of Maya.
When night falls, they enter the land of dreams, and even in dreams, they take care of their corruptions and pains. ||5||
Taking a barren field, they plant falsehood; they shall harvest only falsehood.
The materialistic people shall all remain hungry; the brutal Messenger of Death stands waiting at their door. ||6||
The self-willed manmukh has accumulated a tremendous load of debt in sin; only by contemplating the Word of the Shabad, can this debt be paid off.
As much debt and as many creditors as there are, the Lord makes them into servants, who fall at his feet. ||7||
All the beings which the Lord of the Universe created - He puts the rings through their noses, and leads them all along.
O Nanak, as God drives us on, so do we follow; it is all the Will of the Beloved Lord. ||8||2||
Nat, Fourth Mehl:
The Lord has bathed me in the pool of Ambrosial Nectar.
The spiritual wisdom of the True Guru is the most excellent cleansing bath; bathing in it, all the filthy sins are washed away. ||1||Pause||
The virtues of the Sangat, the Holy Congregation, are so very great. Even the prostitute was saved, by teaching the parrot to speak the Lord's Name.
Krishna was pleased, and so he touched the hunch-back Kubija, and she was transported to the heavens. ||1||
Ajaamal loved his son Naaraayan, and called out his name.
His loving devotion pleased my Lord and Master, who struck down and drove off the Messengers of Death. ||2||
The mortal speaks and by speaking, makes the people listen; but he does not reflect upon what he himself says.
But when he joins the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, he is confirmed in his faith, and he is saved by the Name of the Lord. ||3||
As long as his soul and body are healthy and strong, he does not remember the Lord at all.
But when his home and mansion catch fire, then, he wants to dig the well to draw water. ||4||
O mind, do not join with the faithless cynic, who has forgotten the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
The word of the faithless cynic stings like a scorpion; leave the faithless cynic far, far behind. ||5||
