With faith in the Shabad, the Guru is found, and selfishness is eradicated from within.
Night and day, worship the True Lord with devotion and love forever.
The Treasure of the Naam abides in the mind; O Nanak, in the poise of perfect balance, merge into the Lord. ||4||19||52||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Those who do not serve the True Guru shall be miserable throughout the four ages.
The Primal Being is within their own home, but they do not recognize Him. They are plundered by their egotistical pride and arrogance.
Cursed by the True Guru, they wander around the world begging, until they are exhausted.
They do not serve the True Word of the Shabad, which is the solution to all of their problems. ||1||
O my mind, see the Lord ever close at hand.
He shall remove the pains of death and rebirth; the Word of the Shabad shall fill you to overflowing. ||1||Pause||
Those who praise the True One are true; the True Name is their Support.
They act truthfully, in love with the True Lord.
The True King has written His Order, which no one can erase.
The self-willed manmukhs do not obtain the Mansion of the Lord's Presence. The false are plundered by falsehood. ||2||
Engrossed in egotism, the world perishes. Without the Guru, there is utter darkness.
In emotional attachment to Maya, they have forgotten the Great Giver, the Giver of Peace.
Those who serve the True Guru are saved; they keep the True One enshrined in their hearts.
By His Grace, we find the Lord, and reflect on the True Word of the Shabad. ||3||
Serving the True Guru, the mind becomes immaculate and pure; egotism and corruption are discarded.
So abandon your selfishness, and remain dead while yet alive. Contemplate the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
The pursuit of worldly affairs comes to an end, when you embrace love for the True One.
Those who are attuned to Truth-their faces are radiant in the Court of the True Lord. ||4||
Those who do not have faith in the Primal Being, the True Guru, and who do not enshrine love for the Shabad -
they take their cleansing baths, and give to charity again and again, but they are ultimately consumed by their love of duality.
When the Dear Lord Himself grants His Grace, they are inspired to love the Naam.
O Nanak, immerse yourself in the Naam, through the Infinite Love of the Guru. ||5||20||53||
Siree Raag, Third Mehl:
Whom shall I serve? What shall I chant? I will go and ask the Guru.
I will accept the Will of the True Guru, and eradicate selfishness from within.
By this work and service, the Naam shall come to dwell within my mind.
Through the Naam, peace is obtained; I am adorned and embellished by the True Word of the Shabad. ||1||
O my mind, remain awake and aware night and day, and think of the Lord.
Protect your crops, or else the birds shall descend on your farm. ||1||Pause||
The desires of the mind are fulfilled, when one is filled to overflowing with the Shabad.
One who fears, loves, and is devoted to the Dear Lord day and night, sees Him always close at hand.
Doubt runs far away from the bodies of those, whose minds remain forever attuned to the True Word of the Shabad.
The Immaculate Lord and Master is found. He is True; He is the Ocean of Excellence. ||2||
Those who remain awake and aware are saved, while those who sleep are plundered.
They do not recognize the True Word of the Shabad, and like a dream, their lives fade away.
Like guests in a deserted house, they leave just exactly as they have come.
