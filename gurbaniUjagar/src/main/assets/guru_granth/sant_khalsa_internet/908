Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are manifestations of the One God. He Himself is the Doer of deeds. ||12||
One who purifies his body, crosses over the terrifying world-ocean; he contemplates the essence of his own soul. ||13||
Serving the Guru, he finds everlasting peace; deep within, the Shabad permeates him, coloring him with virtue. ||14||
The Giver of virtue unites with Himself, one who conquers egotism and desire. ||15||
Eradicating the three qualities, dwell in the fourth state. This is the unparalleled devotional worship. ||16||
This is the Yoga of the Gurmukh: Through the Shabad, he understands his own soul, and he enshrines within his heart the One Lord. ||17||
Imbued with the Shabad, his mind becomes steady and stable; this is the most excellent action. ||18||
This true hermit does not enter into religious debates or hypocrisy; the Gurmukh contemplates the Shabad. ||19||
The Gurmukh practices Yoga - he is the true hermit; he practices abstinence and truth, and contemplates the Shabad. ||20||
One who dies in the Shabad and conquers his mind is the true hermit; he understands the Way of Yoga. ||21||
Attachment to Maya is the terrifying world-ocean; through the Shabad, the true hermit saves himself, and his ancestors as well. ||22||
Contemplating the Shabad, you shall be a hero throughout the four ages, O hermit; contemplate the Word of the Guru's Bani in devotion. ||23||
This mind is enticed by Maya, O hermit; contemplating the Shabad, you shall find release. ||24||
He Himself forgives, and unites in His Union; Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary, Lord. ||25||9||
Raamkalee, Third Mehl, Ashtapadees:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Make humility your ear-rings, Yogi, and compassion your patched coat.
Let coming and going be the ashes you apply to your body, Yogi, and then you shall conquer the three worlds. ||1||
Play that harp, Yogi,
which vibrates the unstruck sound current, and remain lovingly absorbed in the Lord. ||1||Pause||
Make truth and contentment your plate and pouch, Yogi; take the Ambrosial Naam as your food.
Make meditation your walking stick, Yogi, and make higher consciousness the horn you blow. ||2||
Make your stable mind the Yogic posture you sit in, Yogi, and then you shall be rid of your tormenting desires.
Go begging in the village of the body, Yogi, and then, you shall obtain the Naam in your lap. ||3||
This harp does not center you in meditation, Yogi, nor does it bring the True Name into your lap.
This harp does not bring you peace, Yogi, nor eliminate egotism from within you. ||4||
Make the Fear of God, and the Love of God, the two gourds of your lute, Yogi, and make this body its neck.
Become Gurmukh, and then vibrate the strings; in this way, your desires shall depart. ||5||
One who understands the Hukam of the Lord's Command is called a Yogi; he links his consciousness to the One Lord.
His cynicism is dispelled, and he becomes immaculately pure; this is how he finds the Way of Yoga. ||6||
Everything that comes into view shall be destroyed; focus your consciousness on the Lord.
Enshrine love for the True Guru, and then you shall obtain this understanding. ||7||
