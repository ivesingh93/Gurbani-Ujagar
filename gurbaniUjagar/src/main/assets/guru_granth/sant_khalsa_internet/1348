Within the mind dwell anger and massive ego.
Worship services are performed with great pomp and ceremony.
Ritual cleansing baths are taken, and sacred marks are applied to the body.
But still, the filth and pollution within never depart. ||1||
No one has ever found God in this way.
The sacred mudras - ritualistic hand gestures - are made, but the mind remains enticed by Maya. ||1||Pause||
They commit sins, under the influence of the five thieves.
They bathe at sacred shrines, and claim that everything has been washed off.
Then they commit them again, without fear of the consequences.
The sinners are bound and gagged, and taken to the City of Death. ||2||
The ankle-bells shake and the cymbals vibrate,
but those who have deception within wander lost like demons.
By destroying its hole, the snake is not killed.
God, who created you, knows everything. ||3||
You worship fire and wear saffron colored robes.
Stung by your misfortune, you abandon your home.
Leaving your own country, you wander in foreign lands.
But you bring the five rejects with you. ||4||
You have split your ears, and now you steal crumbs.
You beg from door to door, but you fail to be satisfied.
You have abandoned your own wife, but now you sneak glances at other women.
God is not found by wearing religious robes; you are utterly miserable! ||5||
He does not speak; he is on silence.
But he is filled with desire; he is made to wander in reincarnation.
Abstaining from food, his body suffers in pain.
He does not realize the Hukam of the Lord's Command; he is afflicted by possessiveness. ||6||
Without the True Guru, no one has attained the supreme status.
Go ahead and ask all the Vedas and the Simritees.
The self-willed manmukhs do useless deeds.
They are like a house of sand, which cannot stand. ||7||
One unto whom the Lord of the Universe becomes Merciful,
sews the Word of the Guru's Shabad into his robes.
Out of millions, it is rare that such a Saint is seen.
O Nanak, with him, we are carried across. ||8||
If one has such good destiny, then the Blessed Vision of His Darshan is obtained.
He saves himself, and carries across all his family as well. ||1||SECOND PAUSE||2||
Prabhaatee, Fifth Mehl:
Meditating in remembrance on the Naam, all the sins are erased.
The accounts held by the Righteous Judge of Dharma are torn up.
Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy,
I have found the Sublime Essence of the Lord. The Supreme Lord God has melted into my heart. ||1||
Dwelling on the Lord, Har, Har, I have found peace.
Your slaves seek the Sanctuary of Your Feet. ||1||Pause||
The cycle of reincarnation is ended, and darkness is dispelled.
The Guru has revealed the door of liberation.
My mind and body are forever imbued with loving devotion to the Lord.
Now I know God, because He has made me know Him. ||2||
He is contained in each and every heart.
Without Him, there is no one at all.
Hatred, conflict, fear and doubt have been eliminated.
God, the Soul of Pure Goodness, has manifested His Righteousness. ||3||
He has rescued me from the most dangerous waves.
Separated from Him for countless lifetimes, I am united with Him once again.
Chanting, intense meditation and strict self-discipline are the contemplation of the Naam.
My Lord and Master has blessed me with His Glance of Grace. ||4||
Bliss, peace and salvation are found in that place,
