Wherever I look, I see You, everywhere.
Through the Perfect Guru, all this is known.
I meditate forever and ever on the Naam; this mind is imbued with the Naam. ||12||
Imbued with the Naam, the body is sanctified.
Without the Naam, they are drowned and dIE without water.
They come and go, but do not understand the Naam. Some, as Gurmukh, realize the Word of the Shabad. ||13||
The Perfect True Guru has imparted this understanding.
Without the Name, no one attains liberation.
Through the Naam, the Name of the Lord, one is blessed with glorious greatness; he remains intuitively attuned to the Lord's Love. ||14||
The body-village crumbles and collapses into a pile of dust.
Without the Shabad, the cycle of reincarnation is not brought to an end.
One who knows the One Lord, through the True Guru, praises the True Lord, and remains immersed in the True Lord. ||15||
When the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace,
the True Word of the Shabad comes to dwell in the mind.
O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Formless Lord, realize the True Lord in His True Court. ||16||8||
Maaroo, Solhay, Third Mehl:
O Creator, it is You Yourself who does all.
All beings and creatures are under Your Protection.
You are hidden, and yet permeating within all; through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, You are realized. ||1||
Devotion to the Lord is a treasure overflowing.
He Himself blesses us with contemplative meditation on the Shabad.
You do whatever You please; my mind is attuned to the True Lord. ||2||
You Yourself are the priceless diamond and jewel.
In Your Mercy, You weigh with Your scale.
All beings and creatures are under Your protection. One who is blessed by Your Grace realizes his own self. ||3||
One who receives Your Mercy, O Primal Lord,
does not die, and is not reborn; he is released from the cycle of reincarnation.
He sings the Glorious Praises of the True Lord, day and night, and, throughout the ages, he knows the One Lord. ||4||
Emotional attachment to Maya wells up throughout the whole world,
from Brahma, Vishnu and all the demi-gods.
Those who are pleasing to Your Will, are attached to the Naam; through spiritual wisdom and understanding, You are recognized. ||5||
The world is engrossed in vice and virtue.
Happiness and misery are totally loaded with pain.
One who becomes Gurmukh finds peace; such a Gurmukh recognizes the Naam. ||6||
No one can erase the record of one's actions.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, one finds the door of salvation.
One who conquers self-conceit and recognizes the Lord, obtains the fruits of his pre-destined rewards. ||7||
Emotionally attached to Maya, one's consciousness is not attached to the Lord.
In the love of duality, he will suffer terrible agony in the world hereafter.
The hypocritical, self-willed manmukhs are deluded by doubt; at the very last moment, they regret and repent. ||8||
In accordance with the Lord's Will, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
He is rid of all sins, and all suffering.
The Lord is immaculate, and immaculate is the Word of His Bani. My mind is imbued with the Lord. ||9||
One who is blessed with the Lord's Glance of Grace, obtains the Lord, the treasure of virtue.
Egotism and possessiveness are brought to an end.
The One Lord is the only Giver of virtue and vice, merits and demerits; how rare are those who, as Gurmukh, understand this. ||10||
My God is immaculate, and utterly infinite.
God unites with Himself, through contemplation of the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
