Day and night, I chant Your Name. ||1||
I am worthless; I have no virtue at all.
God is the Creator, the Cause of all causes. ||1||Pause||
I am foolish, stupid, ignorant and thoughtless;
Your Name is my mind's only hope. ||2||
I have not practiced chanting, deep meditation, self-discipline or good actions;
but within my mind, I have worshipped God's Name. ||3||
I know nothing, and my intellect is inadequate.
Prays Nanak, O God, You are my only Support. ||4||18||69||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
These two words, Har, Har, make up my maalaa.
Continually chanting and reciting this rosary, God has become merciful to me, His humble servant. ||1||
I offer my prayer to the True Guru.
Shower Your Mercy upon me, and keep me safe in Your Sanctuary; please, give me the maalaa, the rosary of Har, Har. ||1||Pause||
One who enshrines this rosary of the Lord's Name within his heart,
is freed of the pains of birth and death. ||2||
The humble being who contemplates the Lord within his heart, and chants the Lord's Name, Har, Har, with his mouth,
never wavers, here or hereafter. ||3||
Says Nanak, one who is imbued with the Name,
goes to the next world with the maalaa of the Lord's Name. ||4||19||70||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
All things belong to Him - let yourself belong to Him as well.
No stain clings to such a humble being. ||1||
The Lord's servant is liberated forever.
Whatever He does, is pleasing to His servant; the way of life of His slave is immaculately pure. ||1||Pause||
One who renounces everything, and enters the Lord's Sanctuary -
how can Maya cling to him? ||2||
With the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, in his mind,
he suffers no anxiety, even in dreams. ||3||
Says Nanak, I have found the Perfect Guru.
My doubts and attachments have been totally obliterated. ||4||20||71||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
When my God is totally pleased with me,
then, tell me, how can suffering or doubt draw near me? ||1||
Continually listening to Your Glory, I live.
I am worthless - save me, O Lord! ||1||Pause||
My suffering has been ended, and my anxiety is forgotten.
I have obtained my reward, chanting the Mantra of the True Guru. ||2||
He is True, and True is His glory.
Remembering, remembering Him in meditation, keep Him clasped to your heart. ||3||
Says Nanak, what action is there left to do,
by one whose mind is filled with the Lord's Name? ||4||21||72||
Aasaa, Fifth Mehl:
Sexual desire, anger, and egotism lead to ruin.
Meditating on the Lord, the Lord's humble servants are redeemed. ||1||
The mortals are asleep, intoxicated with the wine of Maya.
The devotees remain awake, imbued with the Lord's meditation. ||1||Pause||
In emotional attachment and doubt, the mortals wander through countless incarnations.
The devotees remain ever-stable, meditating on the Lord's Lotus Feet. ||2||
Bound to household and possessions, the mortals are lost in the deep, dark pit.
The Saints are liberated, knowing the Lord to be near at hand. ||3||
Says Nanak, one who has taken to God's Sanctuary,
obtains peace in this world, and salvation in the world hereafter. ||4||22||73||
