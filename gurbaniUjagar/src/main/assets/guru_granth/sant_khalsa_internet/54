But when the time comes to settle their accounts, their red robes are corrupt.
His Love is not obtained through hypocrisy. Her false coverings bring only ruin. ||1||
In this way, the Dear Husband Lord ravishes and enjoys His bride.
The happy soul-bride is pleasing to You, Lord; by Your Grace, You adorn her. ||1||Pause||
She is decorated with the Word of the Guru's Shabad; her mind and body belong to her Husband Lord.
With her palms pressed together, she stands, waiting on Him, and offers her True prayers to Him.
Dyed in the deep crimson of the Love of her Darling Lord, she dwells in the Fear of the True One. Imbued with His Love, she is dyed in the color of His Love. ||2||
She is said to be the hand-maiden of her Beloved Lord; His sweetheart surrenders to His Name.
True Love is never broken; she is united in Union with the True One.
Attuned to the Word of the Shabad, her mind is pierced through. I am forever a sacrifice to Him. ||3||
That bride, who is absorbed into the True Guru, shall never become a widow.
Her Husband Lord is Beautiful; His Body is forever fresh and new. The True One does not die, and shall not go.
He continually enjoys His happy soul-bride; He casts His Gracious Glance of Truth upon her, and she abides in His Will. ||4||
The bride braids her hair with Truth; her clothes are decorated with His Love.
Like the essence of sandalwood, He permeates her consciousness, and the Temple of the Tenth Gate is opened.
The lamp of the Shabad is lit, and the Name of the Lord is her necklace. ||5||
She is the most beautiful among women; upon her forehead she wears the Jewel of the Lord's Love.
Her glory and her wisdom are magnificent; her love for the Infinite Lord is True.
Other than her Beloved Lord, she knows no man. She enshrines love for the True Guru. ||6||
Asleep in the darkness of the night, how shall she pass her life-night without her Husband?
Her limbs shall burn, her body shall burn, and her mind and wealth shall burn as well.
When the Husband does not enjoy His bride, then her youth passes away in vain. ||7||
The Husband is on the Bed, but the bride is asleep, and so she does not come to know Him.
While I am asleep, my Husband Lord is awake. Where can I go for advice?
The True Guru has led me to meet Him, and now I dwell in the Fear of God. O Nanak, His Love is always with me. ||8||2||
Siree Raag, First Mehl:
O Lord, You are Your Own Glorious Praise. You Yourself speak it; You Yourself hear it and contemplate it.
You Yourself are the Jewel, and You are the Appraiser. You Yourself are of Infinite Value.
O True Lord, You are Honor and Glory; You Yourself are the Giver. ||1||
O Dear Lord, You are the Creator and the Cause.
If it is Your Will, please save and protect me; please bless me with the lifestyle of the Lord's Name. ||1||Pause||
You Yourself are the flawless diamond; You Yourself are the deep crimson color.
You Yourself are the perfect pearl; You Yourself are the devotee and the pirEst.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, You are praised. In each and every heart, the Unseen is seen. ||2||
You Yourself are the ocean and the boat. You Yourself are this shore, and the one beyond.
O All-knowing Lord, You are the True Way. The Shabad is the Navigator to ferry us across.
One who does not fear God shall live in fear; without the Guru, there is only pitch darkness. ||3||
The Creator alone is seen to be Eternal; all others come and go.
Only You, Lord, are Immaculate and Pure. All others are bound up in worldly pursuits.
Those who are protected by the Guru are saved. They are lovingly attuned to the True Lord. ||4||
