Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
My Guru has rid me of my cynicism.
I am a sacrifice to that Guru; I am devoted to Him, forever and ever. ||1||Pause||
I chant the Guru's Name day and night; I enshrine the Guru's Feet within my mind.
I bathe continually in the dust of the Guru's Feet, washing off my dirty sins. ||1||
I continually serve the Perfect Guru; I humbly bow to my Guru.
The Perfect Guru has blessed me with all fruitful rewards; O Nanak, the Guru has emancipated me. ||2||47||70||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Meditating in remembrance on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the mortal attains salvation.
His sorrows are dispelled, and his fears are all erased; he is in love with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||1||Pause||
His mind worships and adores the Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har; his tongue sings the Praises of the Lord.
Abandoning egotistical pride, sexual desire, anger and slander, he embraces love for the Lord. ||1||
Worship and adore the Merciful Lord God; chanting the Name of the Lord of the Universe, you shall be embellished and exalted.
Says Nanak, whoever becomes the dust of all, merges in the Blessed Vision of the Lord, Har, Har. ||2||48||71||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
I am a sacrifice to my Perfect Guru.
My Savior Lord has saved me; He has revealed the Glory of His Name. ||1||Pause||
He makes His servants and slaves fearless, and takes away all their pain.
So renounce all other efforts, and enshrine the Lord's Lotus Feet within your mind. ||1||
God is the Support of the breath of life, my Best Friend and Companion, the One and Only Creator of the Universe.
Nanak's Lord and Master is the Highest of all; again and again, I humbly bow to Him. ||2||49||72||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
Tell me: other than the Lord, who exists?
The Creator, the Embodiment of Mercy, bestows all comforts; meditate forever on that God. ||1||Pause||
All creatures are strung on His Thread; sing the Praises of that God.
Meditate in remembrance on that Lord and Master who gives you everything. Why would you go to anyone else? ||1||
Service to my Lord and Master is fruitful and rewarding; from Him, you shall obtain the fruits of your mind's desires.
Says Nanak, take your profits and leave; you shall go to your true home in peace. ||2||50||73||
Saarang, Fifth Mehl:
O my Lord and Master, I have come to Your Sanctuary.
The anxiety of my mind departed, when I gazed upon the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. ||1||Pause||
You know my condition, without my speaking. You inspire me to chant Your Name.
My pains are gone, and I am absorbed in peace, poise and bliss, singing Your Glorious Praises. ||1||
Taking me by the arm, You lifted me up, out of the deep dark pit of household and Maya.
Says Nanak, the Guru has broken my bonds, and ended my separation; He has united me with God. ||2||51||74||
