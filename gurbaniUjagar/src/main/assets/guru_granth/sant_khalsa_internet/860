Nothing is in the hands of anyone, O my Lord and Master; such is the understanding the True Guru has given me to understand.
You alone know the hope of servant Nanak, O Lord; gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Lord's Darshan, he is satisfied. ||4||1||
Gond, Fourth Mehl:
Serve such a Lord, and ever meditate on Him, who in an instant erases all sins and mistakes.
If someone forsakes the Lord and places his hopes in another, then all his service to the Lord is rendered fruitless.
O my mind, serve the Lord, the Giver of peace; serving Him, all your hunger shall depart. ||1||
O my mind, place your faith in the Lord.
Wherever I go, my Lord and Master is there with me. The Lord saves the honor of His humble servants and slaves. ||1||Pause||
If you tell your sorrows to another, then he, in return, will tell you of his greater sorrows.
So tell your sorrows to the Lord, your Lord and Master, who shall instantly dispel your pain.
Forsaking such a Lord God, if you tell your sorrows to another, then you shall dIE of shame. ||2||
The relatives, friends and siblings of the world that you see, O my mind, all meet with you for their own purposes.
And that day, when their self-interests are not served, on that day, they shall not come near you.
O my mind, serve your Lord, day and night; He shall help you in good times and bad. ||3||
Why place your faith in anyone, O my mind, who cannot come to your rescue at the last instant?
Chant the Lord's Mantra, take the Guru's Teachings, and meditate on Him. In the end, the Lord saves those who love Him in their consciousness.
Servant Nanak speaks: night and day, chant the Lord's Name, O Saints; this is the only true hope for emancipation. ||4||2||
Gond, Fourth Mehl:
Remembering the Lord in meditation, you shall find bliss and peace forever deep within, and your mind will become tranquil and cool.
It is like the harsh sun of Maya, with its burning heat; seeing the moon, the Guru, its heat totally vanishes. ||1||
O my mind, night and day, meditate, and chant the Lord's Name.
Here and hereafter, He shall protect you, everywhere; serve such a God forever. ||1||Pause||
Meditate on the Lord, who contains all treasures, O my mind; as Gurmukh, search for the jewel, the Lord.
Those who meditate on the Lord, find the Lord, my Lord and Master; I wash the feet of those slaves of the Lord. ||2||
One who realizes the Word of the Shabad, obtains the sublime essence of the Lord; such a Saint is lofty and sublime, the greatest of the great.
The Lord Himself magnifies the glory of that humble servant. No one can lessen or decrease that glory, not even a bit. ||3||
