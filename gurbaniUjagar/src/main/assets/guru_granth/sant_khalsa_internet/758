Just as the earth looks beautiful when the rain falls, so does the Sikh blossom forth meeting the Guru. ||16||
I long to be the servant of Your servants; I call upon You reverently in prayer. ||17||
Nanak offers this prayer to the Lord, that he may meet the Guru, and find peace. ||18||
You Yourself are the Guru, and You Yourself are the chaylaa, the disciple; through the Guru, I meditate on You. ||19||
Those who serve You, become You. You preserve the honor of Your servants. ||20||
O Lord, Your devotional worship is a treasure over-flowing. One who loves You, is blessed with it. ||21||
That humble being alone receives it, unto whom You bestow it. All other clever tricks are fruitless. ||22||
Remembering, remembering, remembering my Guru in meditation, my sleeping mind is awakened. ||23||
Poor Nanak begs for this one blessing, that he may become the slave of the slaves of the Lord. ||24||
Even if the Guru rebukes me, He still seems very sweet to me. And if He actually forgives me, that is the Guru's greatness. ||25||
That which Gurmukh speaks is certified and approved. Whatever the self-willed manmukh says is not accepted. ||26||
Even in the cold, the frost and the snow, the GurSikh still goes out to see his Guru. ||27||
All day and night, I gaze upon my Guru; I install the Guru's Feet in my eyes. ||28||
I make so many efforts for the sake of the Guru; only that which pleases the Guru is accepted and approved. ||29||
Night and day, I worship the Guru's Feet in adoration; have Mercy upon me, O my Lord and Master. ||30||
The Guru is Nanak's body and soul; meeting the Guru, he is satisfied and satiated. ||31||
Nanak's God is perfectly permeating and all-pervading. Here and there and everywhere, the Lord of the Universe. ||32||1||
Raag Soohee, Fourth Mehl, Ashtapadees, Tenth House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Deep within myself, I have enshrined true love for my Beloved.
My body and soul are in ecstasy; I see my Guru before me. ||1||
I have purchased the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
I have obtained the Inaccessible and Unfathomable Ambrosial Nectar from the Perfect Guru. ||1||Pause||
Gazing upon the True Guru, I blossom forth in ecstasy; I am in love with the Name of the Lord.
Through His Mercy, the Lord has united me with Himself, and I have found the Door of Salvation. ||2||
The True Guru is the Lover of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Meeting Him, I dedicate my body and mind to Him.
And if it is so pre-ordained, then I shall automatically drink in the Ambrosial Nectar. ||3||
Praise the Guru while you are asleep, and call on the Guru while you are up.
If only I could meet such a Gurmukh; I would wash His Feet. ||4||
I long for such a Friend, to unite me with my Beloved.
Meeting the True Guru, I have found the Lord. He has met me, easily and effortlessly. ||5||
