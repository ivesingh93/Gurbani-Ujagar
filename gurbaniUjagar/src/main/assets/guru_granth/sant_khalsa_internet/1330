The Creator Himself plays all the games; only a few understand this. ||3||
Meditate on the Name, and the Word of the Shabad, in the early hours before dawn; leave your worldly entanglements behind.
Prays Nanak, the slave of God's slaves: the world loses, and he wins. ||4||9||
Prabhaatee, First Mehl:
The mind is Maya, the mind is a chaser; the mind is a bird flying across the sky.
The thieves are overpowered by the Shabad, and then the body-village prospers and celebrates.
Lord, when You save someone, he is saved; his capital is safe and sound. ||1||
Such is my Treasure, the Jewel of the Naam;
please bless me with the Guru's Teachings, so that I may fall at Your Feet. ||1||Pause||
The mind is a Yogi, the mind is a pleasure-seeker; the mind is foolish and ignorant.
The mind is the giver, the mind is the beggar; the mind is the Great Guru, the Creator.
The five thieves are conquered, and peace is attained; such is the contemplative wisdom of God. ||2||
The One Lord is said to be in each and every heart, but no one can see Him.
The false are cast upside-down into the womb of reincarnation; without the Name, they lose their honor.
Those whom You unite, remain united, if it is Your Will. ||3||
God does not ask about social class or birth; you must find your true home.
That is your social class and that is your status - the karma of what you have done.
The pains of death and rebirth are eradicated; O Nanak, salvation is in the Lord's Name. ||4||10||
Prabhaatee, First Mehl:
He is awake, and even happy, but he is being plundered - he is blind!
The noose is around his neck, and yet, his head is busy with worldly affairs.
In hope, he comes and in desire, he leaves.
The strings of his life are all tangled up; he is utterly helpless. ||1||
The Lord of Awareness, the Lord of Life is awake and aware.
He is the Ocean of peace, the Treasure of Ambrosial Nectar. ||1||Pause||
He does not understand what he is told; he is blind - he does not see, and so he does his evil deeds.
The Transcendent Lord Himself showers His Love and Affection; by His Grace, He bestows glorious greatness. ||2||
With the coming of each and every day, his life is wearing away, bit by bit; but still, his heart is attached to Maya.
Without the Guru, he is drowned, and finds no place of rest, as long as he is caught in duality. ||3||
Day and night, God watches over and takes care of His living beings; they receive pleasure and pain according to their past actions.
Nanak, the unfortunate one, begs for the charity of Truth; please bless him with this glory. ||4||11||
Prabhaatee, First Mehl:
If I remain silent, the world calls me a fool.
If I talk too much, I miss out on Your Love.
My mistakes and faults will be judged in Your Court.
Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, how can I maintain good conduct? ||1||
Such is the falsehood which is plundering the world.
The slanderer slanders me, but even so, I love him. ||1||Pause||
He alone knows the way, who has been slandered.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, he is stamped with the Lord's Insignia in His Court.
He realizes the Naam, the Cause of causes, deep within himself.
He alone knows the way, who is blessed by the Lord's Glance of Grace. ||2||
I am filthy and polluted; the True Lord is Immaculate and Sublime.
Calling oneself sublime, one does not become exalted.
The self-willed manmukh openly eats the great poison.
But one who becomes Gurmukh is absorbed in the Name. ||3||
I am blind, deaf, foolish and ignorant,
