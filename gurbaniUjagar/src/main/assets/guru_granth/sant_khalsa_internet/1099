The followers of the six orders wander and roam around wearing religious robes, but they do not meet God.
They keep the lunar fasts, but they are of no account.
Those who read the Vedas in their entirety, still do not see the sublime essence of reality.
They apply ceremonial marks to their foreheads, and take cleansing baths, but they are blackened within.
They wear religious robes, but without the True Teachings, God is not found.
One who had strayed, finds the Path again, if such pre-ordained destiny is written on his forehead.
One who sees the Guru with his eyes, embellishes and exalts his human life. ||13||
Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:
Focus on that which will not pass away.
Abandon your false actions, and meditate on the True Master. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
God's Light is permeating all, like the moon reflected in the water.
He Himself is revealed, O Nanak, to one who has such destiny inscribed upon his forehead. ||2||
Fifth Mehl:
One's face becomes beautiful, chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and singing His Glorious Praises, twenty-four hours a day.
O Nanak, in the Court of the Lord, you shall be accepted; even the homeless find a home there. ||3||
Pauree:
By wearing religious robes outwardly, God, the Inner-knower is not found.
Without the One Dear Lord, all wander around aimlessly.
Their minds are imbued with attachment to family, and so they continually wander around, puffed up with pride.
The arrogant wander around the world; why are they so proud of their wealth?
Their wealth shall not go with them when they depart; in an instant, it is gone.
They wander around in the world, according to the Hukam of the Lord's Command.
When one's karma is activated, one finds the Guru, and through Him, the Lord and Master is found.
That humble being, who serves the Lord, has his affairs resolved by the Lord. ||14||
Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:
All speak with their mouths, but rare are those one who realize death.
Nanak is the dust of the feet of those who have faith in the One Lord. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
Know that He dwells within all; rare are those who realize this.
There is no obscuring veil on the body of that one, O Nanak, who meets the Guru. ||2||
Fifth Mehl:
I drink in the water which has washed the feet of those who share the Teachings.
My body is filled with infinite love to see my True Master. ||3||
Pauree:
Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Fearless Lord, he becomes attached to Maya.
He comes and goes, and wanders, dancing in countless incarnations.
He gives his word, but then backs out. All that he says is false.
The false person is hollow within; he is totally engrossed in falsehood.
He tries to take vengeance upon the Lord, who bears no vengeance; such a person is trapped by falsehood and greed.
The True King, the Primal Lord God, kills him when He sees what he has done.
The Messenger of Death sees him, and he rots away in pain.
Even-handed justice is administered, O Nanak, in the Court of the True Lord. ||15||
Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:
In the early hours of the morning, chant the Name of God, and meditate on the Feet of the Guru.
The filth of birth and death is erased, singing the Glorious Praises of the True Lord. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
The body is dark, blind and empty, without the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
O Nanak, fruitful is the birth of one, within whose heart the True Master dwells. ||2||
Fifth Mehl:
With my eyes, I have seen the Light; my great thirst for Him is not quenched.
