Maaroo, Fourth Mehl, Third House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
Take the treasure of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. Follow the Guru's Teachings, and the Lord shall bless you with honor.
Here and hereafter, the Lord goes with you; in the end, He shall deliver you.
Where the path is difficult and the street is narrow, there the Lord shall liberate you. ||1||
O my True Guru, implant within me the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
The Lord is my mother, father, child and relative; I have none other than the Lord, O my mother. ||1||Pause||
I feel the pains of love and yearning for the Lord, and the Name of the Lord. If only someone would come and unite me with Him, O my mother.
I bow in humble devotion to one who inspires me to meet with my Beloved.
The almighty and merciful True Guru unites me with the Lord God instantaneously. ||2||
Those who do not remember the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, are most unfortunate, and are slaughtered.
They wander in reincarnation, again and again; they die, and are re-born, and continue coming and going.
Bound and gagged at Death's Door, they are cruelly beaten, and punished in the Court of the Lord. ||3||
O God, I seek Your Sanctuary; O my Sovereign Lord King, please unite me with Yourself.
O Lord, Life of the World, please shower me with Your Mercy; grant me the Sanctuary of the Guru, the True Guru.
The Dear Lord, becoming merciful, has blended servant Nanak with Himself. ||4||1||3||
Maaroo, Fourth Mehl:
I inquire about the commodity of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Is there anyone who can show me the wealth, the capital of the Lord?
I cut myself into pieces, and make myself a sacrifice to that one who leads me to meet my Lord God.
I am filled with the Love of my Beloved; how can I meet my Friend, and merge with Him? ||1||
O my beloved friend, my mind, I take the wealth, the capital of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
The Perfect Guru has implanted the Naam within me; the Lord is my support - I celebrate the Lord. ||1||Pause||
O my Guru, please unite me with the Lord, Har, Har; show me the wealth, the capital of the Lord.
Without the Guru, love does not well up; see this, and know it in your mind.
The Lord has installed Himself within the Guru; so praise the Guru, who unites us with the Lord. ||2||
The ocean, the treasure of devotional worship of the Lord, rests with the Perfect True Guru.
When it pleases the True Guru, He opens the treasure, and the Gurmukhs are illuminated by the Lord's Light.
The unfortunate self-willed manmukhs dIE of thirst, on the very bank of the river. ||3||
The Guru is the Great Giver; I beg for this gift from the Guru,
that He may unite me with God, from whom I was separated for so long! This is the great hope of my mind and body.
If it pleases You, O my Guru, please listen to my prayer; this is servant Nanak's prayer. ||4||2||4||
Maaroo, Fourth Mehl:
O Lord God, please preach Your sermon to me. Through the Guru's Teachings, the Lord is merged into my heart.
Meditate on the sermon of the Lord, Har, Har, O very fortunate ones; the Lord shall bless you with the most sublime status of Nirvaanaa.
