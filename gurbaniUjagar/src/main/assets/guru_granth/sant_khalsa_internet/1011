The Perfect Guru is honored and celebrated; He has taken away the pains of my mind. ||2||
I am the servant and slave of my Master; what glorious greatness of His can I describe?
The Perfect Master, by the Pleasure of His Will, forgives, and then one practices Truth.
I am a sacrifice to my Guru, who re-unites the separated ones. ||3||
The intellect of His servant and slave is noble and true; it is made so by the Guru's intellect.
The intuition of those who are true is beautiful; the intellect of the self-willed manmukh is insipid.
My mind and body belong to You, God; from the very beginning, Truth has been my only support. ||4||
In Truth I sit and stand; I eat and speak the Truth.
With Truth in my consciousness, I gather the wealth of Truth, and drink in the sublime essence of Truth.
In the home of Truth, the True Lord protects me; I speak the Words of the Guru's Teachings with love. ||5||
The self-willed manmukh is very lazy; he is trapped in the wilderness.
He is drawn to the bait, and continually pecking at it, he is trapped; his link to the Lord is ruined.
By Guru's Grace, one is liberated, absorbed in the primal trance of Truth. ||6||
His slave remains continually pierced through with love and affection for God.
Without the True Lord, the soul of the false, corrupt person is burnt to ashes.
Abandoning all evil actions, he crosses over in the boat of Truth. ||7||
Those who have forgotten the Naam have no home, no place of rest.
The Lord's slave renounces greed and attachment, and obtains the Lord's Name.
If You forgive him, Lord, then He is united with You; Nanak is a sacrifice. ||8||4||
Maaroo, First Mehl:
The Lord's slave renounces his egotistical pride, through the Guru's Fear, intuitively and easily.
The slave realizes his Lord and Master; glorious is his greatness!
Meeting with his Lord and Master, he finds peace; His value cannot be described. ||1||
I am the slave and servant of my Lord and Master; all glory is to my Master.
By Guru's Grace, I am saved, in the Sanctuary of the Lord. ||1||Pause||
The slave has been given the most excellent task, by the Primal Command of the Master.
The slave realizes the Hukam of His Command, and submits to His Will forever.
The Lord King Himself grants forgiveness; how glorious is His greatness! ||2||
He Himself is True, and everything is True; this is revealed through the Word of the Guru's Shabad.
He alone serves You, whom You have enjoined to do so.
Without serving Him, no one finds Him; in duality and doubt, they are ruined. ||3||
How could we forget Him from our minds? The gifts which he bestows increase day by day.
Soul and body, all belong to Him; He infused the breath into us.
If he shows His Mercy, then we serve Him; serving Him, we merge in Truth. ||4||
He alone is the Lord's slave, who remains dead while yet alive, and eradicates egotism from within.
His bonds are broken, the fire of his desire is quenched, and he is liberated.
The treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is within all, but how rare are those who, as Gurmukh, obtain it. ||5||
Within the Lord's slave, there is no virtue at all; the Lord's slave is totally unworthy.
There is no Giver as great as You, Lord; You alone are the Forgiver.
Your slave obeys the Hukam of Your Command; this is the most excellent action. ||6||
The Guru is the pool of nectar in the world-ocean; whatever one desires, that fruit is obtained.
The treasure of the Naam brings immortality; enshrine it in your heart and mind.
