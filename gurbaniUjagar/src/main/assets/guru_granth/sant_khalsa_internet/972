When I came to understand this mind, from the tips of my toes to the crown of my head,
then I took my cleansing bath, deep within my self. ||1||
The mind, the master of the breath, abides in the state of supreme bliss.
There is no death, no re-birth, and no aging for me now. ||1||Pause||
Turning away from materialism, I have found intuitive support.
I have entered into the sky of the mind, and opened the Tenth Gate.
The chakras of the coiled Kundalini energy have been opened,
and I have met my Sovereign Lord King without fear. ||2||
My attachment to Maya has been eradicated;
the moon energy has devoured the sun energy.
When I was focused and merged into the all-pervading Lord,
then the unstruck sound current began to vibrate. ||3||
The Speaker has spoken, and proclaimed the Word of the Shabad.
The hearer has heard, and enshrined it in the mind.
Chanting to the Creator, one crosses over.
Says Kabeer, this is the essence. ||4||1||10||
The moon and the sun are both the embodiment of light.
Within their light, is God, the incomparable. ||1||
O spiritual teacher, contemplate God.
In this light is contained the expanse of the created universe. ||1||Pause||
Gazing upon the diamond, I humbly salute this diamond.
Says Kabeer, the Immaculate Lord is indescribable. ||2||2||11||
People of the world, remain awake and aware. Even though you are awake, you are being robbed, O Siblings of Destiny.
While the Vedas stand guard watching, the Messenger of Death carries you away. ||1||Pause||
He thinks that the bitter nimm fruit is a mango, and the mango is a bitter nimm. He imagines the ripe banana on the thorny bush.
He thinks that the ripe coconut hangs on the barren simmal tree; what a stupid, idiotic fool he is! ||1||
The Lord is like sugar, spilled onto the sand; the elephant cannot pick it up.
Says Kabeer, give up your ancestry, social status and honor; be like the tiny ant - pick up and eat the sugar. ||2||3||12||
The Word Of Naam Dayv Jee, Raamkalee, First House:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The boy takes paper, cuts it and makes a kite, and flies it in the sky.
Talking with his friends, he still keeps his attention on the kite string. ||1||
My mind has been pierced by the Name of the Lord,
like the goldsmith, whose attention is held by his work. ||1||Pause||
The young girl in the city takes a pitcher, and fills it with water.
She laughs, and plays, and talks with her friends, but she keeps her attention focused on the pitcher of water. ||2||
The cow is let loose, out of the mansion of the ten gates, to graze in the field.
It grazes up to five miles away, but keeps its attention focused on its calf. ||3||
Says Naam Dayv, listen, O Trilochan: the child is laid down in the cradle.
Its mother is at work, inside and outside, but she holds her child in her thoughts. ||4||1||
There are countless Vedas, Puraanas and Shaastras; I do not sing their songs and hymns.
