When I came to the Sanctuary of the Holy Saints, all my evil-mindedness was dispelled.
Then, O Nanak, I remembered the Chintaamani, the jewel which fulfills all desires, and the noose of Death was snapped. ||3||7||
Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:
O man, grasp this Truth firmly in your soul.
The whole world is just like a dream; it will pass away in an instant. ||1||Pause||
Like a wall of sand, built up and plastered with great care, which does not last even a few days,
just so are the pleasures of Maya. Why are you entangled in them, you ignorant fool? ||1||
Understand this today - it is not yet too late! Chant and vibrate the Name of the Lord.
Says Nanak, this is the subtle wisdom of the Holy Saints, which I proclaim out loud to you. ||2||8||
Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:
In this world, I have not found any true friend.
The whole world is attached to its own pleasures, and when trouble comes, no one is with you. ||1||Pause||
Wives, friends, children and relatives - all are attached to wealth.
When they see a poor man, they all forsake his company and run away. ||1||
So what should I say to this crazy mind, which is affectionately attached to them?
The Lord is the Master of the meek, the Destroyer of all fears, and I have forgotten to praise Him. ||2||
Like a dog's tail, which will never straighten out, the mind will not change, no matter how many things are tried.
Says Nanak, please, Lord, uphold the honor of Your innate nature; I chant Your Name. ||3||9||
Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:
O mind, you have not accepted the Guru's Teachings.
What is the use of shaving your head, and wearing saffron robes? ||1||Pause||
Abandoning Truth, you cling to falsehood; your life is uselessly wasting away.
Practicing hypocrisy, you fill your belly, and then sleep like an animal. ||1||
You do not know the Way of the Lord's meditation; you have sold yourself into Maya's hands.
The madman remains entangled in vice and corruption; he has forgotten the jewel of the Naam. ||2||
He remains thoughtless, not thinking of the Lord of the Universe; his life is uselessly passing away.
Says Nanak, O Lord, please, confirm your innate nature; this mortal is continually making mistakes. ||3||10||
Sorat'h, Ninth Mehl:
That man, who in the midst of pain, does not feel pain,
who is not affected by pleasure, affection or fear, and who looks alike upon gold and dust;||1||Pause||
Who is not swayed by either slander or praise, nor affected by greed, attachment or pride;
who remains unaffected by joy and sorrow, honor and dishonor;||1||
who renounces all hopes and desires and remains desireless in the world;
who is not touched by sexual desire or anger - within his heart, God dwells. ||2||
That man, blessed by Guru's Grace, understands this way.
O Nanak, he merges with the Lord of the Universe, like water with water. ||3||11||
