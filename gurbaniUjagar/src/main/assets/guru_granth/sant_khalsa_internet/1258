It shall eventually merge back into that from which it came, and all its expanse shall be gone. ||4||1||
Malaar, Third Mehl:
Those who realize the Hukam of the Lord's Command are united with Him; through the Word of His Shabad, their egotism is burnt away.
They perform true devotional worship day and night; they remain lovingly attuned to the True Lord.
They gaze on their True Lord forever, through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, with loving ease. ||1||
O mortal, accept His Will and find peace.
God is pleased by the Pleasure of His Own Will. Whomever He forgives, meets no obstacles on the way. ||1||Pause||
Under the influence of the three gunas, the three dispositions, the mind wanders everywhere, without love or devotion to the Lord.
No one is ever saved or liberated, by doing deeds in ego.
Whatever our Lord and Master wills, comes to pass. People wander according to their past actions. ||2||
Meeting with the True Guru, the mind is overpowered; the Lord's Name comes to abide in the mind.
The value of such a person cannot be estimated; nothing at all can be said about him.
He comes to dwell in the fourth state; he remains merged in the True Lord. ||3||
My Lord God is Inaccessible and Unfathomable. His value cannot be expressed.
By Guru's Grace, he comes to understand, and live the Shabad.
O Nanak, praise the Naam, the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; you shall be honored in the Court of the Lord. ||4||2||
Malaar, Third Mehl:
Rare is that person who, as Gurmukh, understands; the Lord has bestowed His Glance of Grace.
There is no Giver except the Guru. He grants His Grace and forgives.
Meeting the Guru, peace and tranquility well up; chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, day and night. ||1||
O my mind, meditate on the Ambrosial Name of the Lord.
Meeting with the True Guru and the Primal Being, the Name is obtained, and one remains forever absorbed in the Lord's Name. ||1||Pause||
The self-willed manmukhs are forever separated from the Lord; no one is with them.
They are stricken with the great disease of egotism; they are hit on the head by the Messenger of Death.
Those who follow the Guru's Teachings are never separated from the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. They dwell on the Naam, night and day. ||2||
You are the One and Only Creator of all. You continually create, watch over and contemplate.
Some are Gurmukh - You unite them with Yourself. You bless then with the treasure of devotion.
You Yourself know everything. Unto whom should I complain? ||3||
The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is Ambrosial Nectar. By the Lord's Grace, it is obtained.
Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, night and day, the intuitive peace and poise of the Guru is obtained.
O Nanak, the Naam is the greatest treasure. Focus your consciousness on the Naam. ||4||3||
Malaar, Third Mehl:
I praise the Guru, the Giver of peace, forever. He truly is the Lord God.
By Guru's Grace, I have obtained the supreme status. His glorious greatness is glorious!
One who sings the Glorious Praises of the True Lord, merges in the True Lord. ||1||
O mortal, contemplate the Guru's Word in your heart.
Abandon your false family, poisonous egotism and desire; remember in your heart, that you will have to leave. ||1||Pause||
The True Guru is the Giver of the Lord's Name. There is no other giver at all.
