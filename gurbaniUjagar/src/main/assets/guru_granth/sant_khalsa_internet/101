Whoever drinks this in, is satisfied.
Whoever obtains the Sublime Essence of the Naam becomes immortal.
The Treasure of the Naam is obtained by one whose mind is filled with the Word of the Guru's Shabad. ||2||
One who obtains the Sublime Essence of the Lord is satisfied and fulfilled.
One who obtains this Flavor of the Lord does not waver.
One who has this destiny written on his forehead obtains the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. ||3||
The Lord has come into the hands of the One, the Guru, who has blessed so many with good fortune.
Attached to Him, a great many have been liberated.
The Gurmukh obtains the Treasure of the Naam; says Nanak, those who see the Lord are very rare. ||4||15||22||
Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
My Lord, Har, Har, Har, is the nine treasures, the supernatural spiritual powers of the Siddhas, wealth and prosperity.
He is the Deep and Profound Treasure of Life.
Hundreds of thousands, even millions of pleasures and delights are enjoyed by one who falls at the Guru's Feet. ||1||
Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, all are sanctified,
and all family and friends are saved.
By Guru's Grace, I meditate on the Inaccessible and Unfathomable True Lord. ||2||
The One, who is sought by all,
only a few, by great good fortune, receive His Darshan.
His Place is lofty, infinite and unfathomable; the Guru has shown me that palace. ||3||
Your Ambrosial Name is deep and profound.
That person is liberated, in whose heart You dwell.
The Guru cuts away all his bonds; O Servant Nanak, he is absorbed in the poise of intuitive peace. ||4||16||23||
Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
By God's Grace, I meditate on the Lord, Har, Har.
By God's Kindness, I sing the songs of joy.
While standing and sitting, while sleeping and while awake, meditate on the Lord, all your life. ||1||
The Holy Saint has given me the Medicine of the Naam.
My sins have been cut out, and I have become pure.
I am filled with bliss, and all my pains have been taken away. All my suffering has been dispelled. ||2||
One who has my Beloved on his side,
is liberated from the world-ocean.
One who recognizes the Guru practices Truth; why should he be afraid? ||3||
Since I found the company of the Holy,
and met the Guru, the demon of pride has departed.
With each and every breath, Nanak sings the Lord's Praises. The True Guru has covered my sins. ||4||17||24||
Maajh, Fifth Mehl:
Through and through, the Lord is intermingled with His servant.
God, the Giver of Peace, cherishes His servant.
I carry the water, wave the fan, and grind the grain for the servant of my Lord and Master. ||1||
God has cut the noose from around my neck; He has placed me in His Service.
The Lord and Master's Command is pleasing to the mind of His servant.
He does that which pleases his Lord and Master. Inwardly and outwardly, the servant knows his Lord. ||2||
You are the All-knowing Lord and Master; You know all ways and means.
