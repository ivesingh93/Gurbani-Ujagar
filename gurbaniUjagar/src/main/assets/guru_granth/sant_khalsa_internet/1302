I am wonder-struck, wonder-struck, wonder-struck and amazed, dyed in the deep crimson color of my Beloved.
Says Nanak, the Saints savor this sublime essence, like the mute, who tastes the sweet candy, but only smiles. ||2||1||20||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
The Saints do not know any other except God.
They look upon all equally, the high and the low; they speak of Him with their mouths, and honor Him in their minds. ||1||Pause||
He is pervading and permeating each and every heart; He is the Ocean of Peace, the Destroyer of fear. He is my praanaa - the Breath of Life.
My mind was enlightened, and my doubt was dispelled, when the Guru whispered His Mantra into my ears. ||1||
He is All-powerful, the Ocean of Mercy, the All-knowing Searcher of Hearts.
Twenty-four hours a day Nanak sings His Praises, and begs for the Gift of the Lord. ||2||2||21||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
Many speak and talk about God.
But one who understands the essence of Yoga - such a humble servant is very rare||1||Pause||
He has no pain - he is totally at peace. With his eyes, he sees only the One Lord.
No one seems evil to him - all are good. There is no defeat - he is totally victorious. ||1||
He is never in sorrow - he is always happy; but he gives this up, and does not take anything.
Says Nanak, the humble servant of the Lord is himself the Lord, Har, Har; he does not come and go in reincarnation. ||2||3||22||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
I pray that my heart may never forget my Beloved.
My body and mind are blended with Him, but the Enticer, Maya, is enticing me, O my mother. ||1||Pause||
Those unto whom I tell my pain and frustration - they themselves are caught and stuck.
In all sorts of ways, Maya has cast the net; the knots cannot be loosened. ||1||
Wandering and roaming, slave Nanak has come to the Sanctuary of the Saints.
The bonds of ignorance, doubt, emotional attachment and the love of Maya have been cut; God hugs me close in His Embrace. ||2||4||23||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
My home is filled with ecstasy, pleasure and joy.
I sing the Naam, and I meditate on the Naam. The Naam is the Support of my breath of life. ||1||Pause||
The Naam is spiritual wisdom, the Naam is my purifying bath. The Naam resolves all my affairs.
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is glorious grandeur; the Naam is glorious greatness. The Name of the Lord carries me across the terrifying world-ocean. ||1||
The Unfathomable Treasure, the Priceless Gem - I have received it, through the Guru's Feet.
Says Nanak, God has become Merciful; my heart is intoxicated by the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. ||2||5||24||
Kaanraa, Fifth Mehl:
My Friend, my Best Friend, my Lord and Master, is near.
He sees and hears everything; He is with everyone. You are here for such short time - why do you do evil? ||1||Pause||
Except for the Naam, whatever you are involved with is nothing - nothing is yours.
Hereafter, everything is revealed to your gaze; but in this world, all are enticed by the darkness of doubt. ||1||
People are caught in Maya, attached to their children and spouses. They have forgotten the Great and Generous Giver.
