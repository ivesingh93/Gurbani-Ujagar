He Himself is the Doer, and He Himself is the Cause; the Lord Himself is our Saving Grace. ||3||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Those who do not meet with the Guru, who have no Fear of God at all,
continue coming and going in reincarnation, and suffer terrible pain; their anxiety is never relieved.
They are beaten like clothes being washed on the rocks, and struck every hour like chimes.
O Nanak, without the True Name, these entanglements are not removed from hanging over one's head. ||1||
Third Mehl:
I have searched throughout the three worlds, O my friend; egotism is bad for the world.
Don't worry, O my soul; speak the Truth, O Nanak, the Truth, and only the Truth. ||2||
Pauree:
The Lord Himself forgives the Gurmukhs; they are absorbed and immersed in the Lord's Name.
He Himself links them to devotional worship; they bear the Insignia of the Guru's Shabad.
Those who turn towards the Guru, as sunmukh, are beautiful. They are famous in the Court of the True Lord.
In this world, and in the world hereafter, they are liberated; they realize the Lord.
Blessed, blessed are those humble beings who serve the Lord. I am a sacrifice to them. ||4||
Shalok, First Mehl:
The rude, ill-mannered bride is encased in the body-tomb; she is blackened, and her mind is impure.
She can enjoy her Husband Lord, only if she is virtuous. O Nanak, the soul-bride is unworthy, and without virtue. ||1||
First Mehl:
She has good conduct, true self-discipline, and a perfect family.
O Nanak, day and night, she is always good; she loves her Beloved Husband Lord. ||2||
Pauree:
One who realizes his own self, is blessed with the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Granting His Mercy, the Guru merges him in the Word of His Shabad.
The Word of the Guru's Bani is immaculate and pure; through it, one drinks in the sublime essence of the Lord.
Those who taste the sublime essence of the Lord, forsake other flavors.
Drinking in the sublime essence of the Lord, they remain satisfied forever; their hunger and thirst are quenched. ||5||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
Her Husband Lord is pleased, and He enjoys His bride; the soul-bride adorns her heart with the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
O Nanak, that bride who stands before Him, is the most noble and respected woman. ||1||
First Mehl:
In her father-in-law's home hereafter, and in her parents' home in this world, she belongs to her Husband Lord. Her Husband is inaccessible and unfathomable.
O Nanak, she is the happy soul-bride, who is pleasing to her carefree, independent Lord. ||2||
Pauree:
That king sits upon the throne, who is worthy of that throne.
Those who realize the True Lord, they alone are the true kings.
These mere earthly rulers are not called kings; in the love of duality, they suffer.
Why should someone praise someone else who is also created? They depart in no time at all.
The One True Lord is eternal and imperishable. One who, as Gurmukh, understands becomes eternal as well. ||6||
Shalok, Third Mehl:
The One Lord is the Husband of all. No one is without the Husband Lord.
O Nanak, they are the pure soul-brides, who merge in the True Guru. ||1||
Third Mehl:
The mind is churning with so many waves of desire. How can one be emancipated in the Court of the Lord?
Be absorbed in the Lord's True Love, and imbued with the deep color of the Lord's Infinite Love.
O Nanak, by Guru's Grace, one is emancipated, if the consciousness is attached to the True Lord. ||2||
Pauree:
The Name of the Lord is priceless. How can its value be estimated?
