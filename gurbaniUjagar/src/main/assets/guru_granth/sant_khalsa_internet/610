Nanak has met with the Perfect Guru; all his sorrows have been dispelled. ||4||5||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
To the happy person, everyone seems happy; to the sick person, everyone seems sick.
The Lord and Master acts, and causes us to act; union is in His Hands. ||1||
O my mind, no one appears to be mistaken,
one who has dispelled his own doubts; he realizes that everyone is God. ||Pause||
One whose mind is comforted in the Society of the Saints, believes that all are joyful.
One whose mind is afflicted by the disease of egotism, cries out in birth and death. ||2||
Everything is clear to one whose eyes are blessed with the ointment of spiritual wisdom.
In the darkness of spiritual ignorance, he sees nothing at all; he wanders around in reincarnation, over and over again. ||3||
Hear my prayer, O Lord and Master; Nanak begs for this happiness:
wherever Your Holy Saints sing the Kirtan of Your Praises, let my mind be attached to that place. ||4||6||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
My body belongs to the Saints, my wealth belongs to the Saints, and my mind belongs to the Saints.
By the Grace of the Saints, I meditate on the Lord's Name, and then, all comforts come to me. ||1||
Without the Saints, there are no other givers.
Whoever takes to the Sanctuary of the Holy Saints, is carried across. ||Pause||
Millions of sins are erased by serving the humble Saints, and singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord with love.
One finds peace in this world, and one's face is radiant in the next world, by associating with the humble Saints, through great good fortune. ||2||
I have only one tongue, and the Lord's humble servant is filled with countless virtues; how can I sing his praises?
The inaccessible, unapproachable and eternally unchanging Lord is obtained in the Sanctuary of the Saints. ||3||
I am worthless, lowly, without friends or support, and full of sins; I long for the Shelter of the Saints.
I am drowning in the deep, dark pit of household attachments - please save me, Lord! ||4||7||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl, First House:
O Creator Lord, You fulfill the desires of those, within whose heart You abide.
Your slaves do not forget You; the dust of Your feet is pleasing to their minds. ||1||
Your Unspoken Speech cannot be spoken.
O treasure of excellence, Giver of peace, Lord and Master, Your greatness is the highest of all. ||Pause||
The mortal does those deeds, and those alone, which You ordained by destiny.
Your servant, whom You bless with Your service, is satisfied and fulfilled, beholding the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. ||2||
You are contained in all, but he alone realizes this, whom You bless with understanding.
By Guru's Grace, his spiritual ignorance is dispelled, and he is respected everywhere. ||3||
He alone is spiritually enlightened, he alone is a meditator, and he alone is a man of good nature.
Says Nanak, one unto whom the Lord becomes Merciful, does not forget the Lord from his mind. ||4||8||
Sorat'h, Fifth Mehl:
The whole creation is engrossed in emotional attachment; sometimes, one is high, and at other times, low.
No one can be purified by any rituals or devices; they cannot reach their goal. ||1||
