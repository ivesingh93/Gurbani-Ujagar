But if the Word of my True Guru is not pleasing to his mind, then all his preparations and beautiful decorations are useless. ||3||
Walk playfully and carefree, O my friends and companions; cherish the Glorious Virtues of my Lord and Master.
To serve, as Gurmukh, is pleasing to my God. Through the True Guru, the unknown is known. ||4||
Women and men, all the men and women, all came from the One Primal Lord God.
My mind loves the dust of the feet of the humble; the Lord emancipates those who meet with the Lord's humble servants. ||5||
From village to village, throughout all the cities I wandered; and then, inspired by the Lord's humble servants, I found Him deep within the nucleus of my heart.
Faith and longing have welled up within me, and I have been blended with the Lord; the Guru, the Guru, has saved me. ||6||
The thread of my breath has been made totally sublime and pure; I contemplate the Shabad, the Word of the True Guru.
I came back to the home of my own inner self; drinking in the ambrosial essence, I see the world, without my eyes. ||7||
I cannot describe Your Glorious Virtues, Lord; You are the temple, and I am just a tiny worm.
Bless Nanak with Your Mercy, and unite him with the Guru; meditating on my Lord, my mind is comforted and consoled. ||8||5||
Nat, Fourth Mehl:
O my mind, vibrate, meditate on the inaccessible and infinite Lord and Master.
I am such a great sinner; I am so unworthy. And yet the Guru, in His Mercy, has saved me. ||1||Pause||
I have found the Holy Person, the Holy and humble servant of the Lord; I offer a prayer to Him, my Beloved Guru.
Please, bless me with the wealth, the capital of the Lord's Name, and take away all my hunger and thirst. ||1||
The moth, the deer, the bumble bee, the elephant and the fish are ruined, each by the one passion that controls them.
The five powerful demons are in the body; the Guru, the True Guru turns out these sins. ||2||
I searched and searched through the Shaastras and the Vedas; Naarad the silent sage proclaimed these words as well.
Chanting the Lord's Name, salvation is attained; the Guru saves those in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. ||3||
In love with the Beloved Lord God, one looks at Him as the lotus looks at the sun.
The peacock dances on the mountain, when the clouds hang low and heavy. ||4||
The faithless cynic may be totally drenched with ambrosial nectar, but even so, all his branches and flowers are filled with venom.
The more one bows down in humility before the faithless cynic, the more he provokes, and stabs, and spits out his poison. ||5||
Remain with the Holy man, the Saint of the Saints, who chants the Lord's Praises for the benefit of all.
Meeting the Saint of Saints, the mind blossoms forth, like the lotus, exalted by obtaining the water. ||6||
The waves of greed are like mad dogs with rabies. Their madness ruins everything.
When the news reached the Court of my Lord and Master, the Guru took up the sword of spiritual wisdom, and killed them. ||7||
Save me, save me, save me, O my God; shower me with Your Mercy, and save me!
O Nanak, I have no other support; the Guru, the True Guru, has saved me. ||8||6|| Chhakaa 1.||
