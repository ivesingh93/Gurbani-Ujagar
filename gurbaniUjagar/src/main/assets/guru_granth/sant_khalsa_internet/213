You wear white clothes and take cleansing baths, and anoint yourself with sandalwood oil.
But you do not remember the Fearless, Formless Lord - you are like an elephant bathing in the mud. ||3||
When God becomes merciful, He leads you to meet the True Guru; all peace is in the Name of the Lord.
The Guru has liberated me from bondage; servant Nanak sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. ||4||14||152||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
O my mind, dwell always upon the Guru, Guru, Guru.
The Guru has made the jewel of this human life prosperous and fruitful. I am a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. ||1||Pause||
As many breaths and morsels as you take, O my mind - so many times, sing His Glorious Praises.
When the True Guru becomes merciful, then this wisdom and understanding is obtained. ||1||
O my mind, taking the Naam, you shall be released from the bondage of death, and the peace of all peace will be found.
Serving your Lord and Master, the True Guru, the Great Giver, you shall obtain the fruits of your mind's desires. ||2||
The Name of the Creator is your beloved friend and child; it alone shall go along with you, O my mind.
So serve your True Guru, and you shall receive the Name from the Guru. ||3||
When God, the Merciful Guru, showered His Mercy upon me, all my anxieties were dispelled.
Nanak has found the peace of the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises. All his sorrows have been dispelled. ||4||15||153||
Raag Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
The thirst of only a few is quenched. ||1||Pause||
People may accumulate hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, and yet the mind is not restrained.
They only yearn for more and more. ||1||
They may have all sorts of beautiful women, but still, they commit adultery in the homes of others.
They do not distinguish between good and bad. ||2||
They wander around lost, trapped in the myriad bonds of Maya; they do not sing the Praises of the Treasure of Virtue.
Their minds are engrossed in poison and corruption. ||3||
Those, unto whom the Lord shows His Mercy, remain dead while yet alive. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, they cross over the ocean of Maya.
O Nanak, those humble beings are honored in the Court of the Lord. ||4||1||154||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
The Lord is the essence of all. ||1||Pause||
Some practice Yoga, some indulge in pleasures; some live in spiritual wisdom, some live in meditation.
Some are bearers of the staff. ||1||
Some chant in meditation, some practice deep, austere meditation; some worship Him in adoration, some practice daily rituals.
Some live the life of a wanderer. ||2||
Some live by the shore, some live on the water; some study the Vedas.
Nanak loves to worship the Lord. ||3||2||155||
Gauree, Fifth Mehl:
To sing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises is my treasure. ||1||Pause||
You are my delight, You are my praise. You are my beauty, You are my love.
O God, You are my hope and support. ||1||
You are my pride, You are my wealth. You are my honor, You are my breath of life.
The Guru has repaired that which was broken. ||2||
You are in the household, and You are in the forest. You are in the village, and You are in the wilderness.
