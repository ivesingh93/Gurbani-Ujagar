O Nanak, these are not the eyes which can see my Beloved Husband Lord. ||3||
Pauree:
That humble being, who, as Gurmukh, serves the Lord, obtains all peace and pleasure.
He Himself is saved, along with his family, and all the world is saved as well.
He collects the wealth of the Lord's Name, and all his thirst is quenched.
He renounces worldly greed, and his inner being is lovingly attuned to the Lord.
Forever and ever, the home of his heart is filled with bliss; the Lord is his companion, help and support.
He looks alike upon enemy and friend, and wishes well to all.
He alone is fulfilled in this world, who meditates on the spiritual wisdom of the Guru.
He obtains what is pre-ordained for him, according to the Lord. ||16||
Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:
The true person is said to be beautiful; false is the reputation of the false.
O Nanak, rare are those who have Truth in their laps. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
The face of my friend, the Lord, is incomparably beautiful; I would watch Him, twenty-four hours a day.
In sleep, I saw my Husband Lord; I am a sacrifice to that dream. ||2||
Fifth Mehl:
O my friend, realize the True Lord. Just to talk about Him is useless.
See Him within your mind; your Beloved is not far away. ||3||
Pauree:
The earth, the Akaashic ethers of the sky, the nether regions of the underworld, the moon and the sun shall pass away.
Emperors, bankers, rulers and leaders shall depart, and their homes shall be demolished.
The poor and the rich, the humble and the intoxicated, all these people shall pass away.
The Qazis, Shaykhs and preachers shall all arise and depart.
The spiritual teachers, prophets and disciples - none of these shall remain permanently.
Fasts, calls to prayer and sacred scriptures - without understanding, all these shall vanish.
The 8.4 million species of beings of the earth shall all continue coming and going in reincarnation.
The One True Lord God is eternal and unchanging. The Lord's slave is also eternal. ||17||
Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:
I have seen and examined all; without the One Lord, there is none at all.
Come, and show me Your face, O my friend, so that my body and mind may be cooled and soothed. ||1||
Fifth Mehl:
The lover is without hope, but within my mind, there is great hope.
In the midst of hope, only You, O Lord, remain free of hope; I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice to You. ||2||
Fifth Mehl:
Even if I just hear of separation from You, I am in pain; without seeing You, O Lord, I die.
Without her Beloved, the separated lover takes no comfort. ||3||
Pauree:
River-banks, sacred shrines, idols, temples, and places of pilgrimage like Kaydarnaat'h, Mat'huraa and Benares,
the three hundred thirty million gods, along with Indra, shall all pass away.
The Simritees, Shaastras, the four Vedas and the six systems of philosophy shall vanish.
Prayer books, Pandits, religious scholars, songs, poems and poets shall also depart.
Those who are celibate, truthful and charitable, and the Sannyaasee hermits are all subject to death.
The silent sages, the Yogis and the nudists, along with the Messengers of Death, shall pass away.
Whatever is seen shall perish; all will dissolve and disappear.
Only the Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent Lord, is permanent. His servant becomes permanent as well. ||18||
Shalok Dakhanay, Fifth Mehl:
Hundreds of times naked does not make the person naked; tens of thousands of hungers do not make him hungry;
millions of pains do not cause him pain. O Nanak, the Husband Lord blesses him with his Glance of Grace. ||1||
