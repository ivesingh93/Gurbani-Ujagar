The Gurmukh eradicates egotism from within.
No filth sticks to the Gurmukh.
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, comes to dwell within the mind of the Gurmukh. ||2||
Through karma and Dharma, good actions and righteous faith, the Gurmukh becomes true.
The Gurmukh burns away egotism and duality.
The Gurmukh is attuned to the Naam, and is at peace. ||3||
Instruct your own mind, and understand Him.
You may preach to other people, but no one will listen.
The Gurmukh understands, and is always at peace. ||4||
The self-willed manmukhs are such clever hypocrites.
No matter what they do, it is not acceptable.
They come and go in reincarnation, and find no place of rest. ||5||
The manmukhs perform their rituals, but they are totally selfish and conceited.
They sit there, like storks, pretending to meditate.
Caught by the Messenger of Death, they shall regret and repent in the end. ||6||
Without serving the True Guru, liberation is not obtained.
By Guru's Grace, one meets the Lord.
The Guru is the Great Giver, throughout the four ages. ||7||
For the Gurmukh, the Naam is social status, honor and glorious greatness.
Maya, the daughter of the ocean, has been slain.
O Nanak, without the Name, all clever tricks are false. ||8||2||
Gauree, Third Mehl:
Learn the Dharma of this age, O Siblings of Destiny;
all understanding is obtained from the Perfect Guru.
Here and hereafter, the Lord's Name is our Companion. ||1||
Learn of the Lord, and contemplate Him in your mind.
By Guru's Grace, your filth shall be washed away. ||1||Pause||
Through argument and debate, He cannot be found.
The mind and body are made insipid through the love of duality.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, lovingly attune yourself to the True Lord. ||2||
This world is polluted with egotism.
By taking cleansing baths daily at sacred shrines of pilgrimage, egotism is not eliminated.
Without meeting the Guru, they are tortured by Death. ||3||
Those humble beings are true, who conquer their ego.
Through the Word of the Guru's Shabad, they conquer the five thieves.
They save themselves, and save all their generations as well. ||4||
The Actor has staged the drama of emotional attachment to Maya.
The self-willed manmukhs cling blindly to it.
The Gurmukhs remain detached, and lovingly attune themselves to the Lord. ||5||
The disguisers put on their various disguises.
Desire rages within them, and they carry on egotistically.
They do not understand themselves, and they lose the game of life. ||6||
Putting on religious robes, they act so clever,
but they are totally deluded by doubt and emotional attachment to Maya.
Without serving the Guru, they suffer in terrible pain. ||7||
Those who are attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Lord, remain detached forever.
Even as householders, they lovingly attune themselves to the True Lord.
O Nanak, those who serve the True Guru are blessed and very fortunate. ||8||3||
Gauree, Third Mehl:
Brahma is the founder of the study of the Vedas.
From him emanated the gods, enticed by desire.
They wander in the three qualities, and they do not dwell within their own home. ||1||
The Lord has saved me; I have met the True Guru.
He has implanted devotional worship of the Lord's Name, night and day. ||1||Pause||
The songs of Brahma entangle people in the three qualities.
Reading about the debates and disputes, they are hit over the head by the Messenger of Death.
