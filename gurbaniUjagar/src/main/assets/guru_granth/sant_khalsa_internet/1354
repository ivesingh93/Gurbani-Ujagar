Cursed is loving attachment to one's mother and father; cursed is loving attachment to one's siblings and relatives.
Cursed is attachment to the joys of family life with one's spouse and children.
Cursed is attachment to household affairs.
Only loving attachment to the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is True. Nanak dwells there in peace. ||2||
The body is false; its power is temporary.
It grows old; its love for Maya increases greatly.
The human is only a temporary guest in the home of the body, but he has high hopes.
The Righteous Judge of Dharma is relentless; he counts each and every breath.
The human body, so difficult to obtain, has fallen into the deep dark pit of emotional attachment. O Nanak, its only support is God, the Essence of Reality.
O God, Lord of the World, Lord of the Universe, Master of the Universe, please be kind to me. ||3||
This fragile body-fortress is made up of water, plastered with blood and wrapped in skin.
It has nine gates, but no doors; it is supported by pillars of wind, the channels of the breath.
The ignorant person does not meditate in remembrance on the Lord of the Universe; he thinks that this body is permanent.
This precious body is saved and redeemed in the Sanctuary of the Holy, O Nanak,
chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har, Har, Haray. ||4||
O Glorious, Eternal and Imperishable, Perfect and Abundantly Compassionate,
Profound and Unfathomable, Lofty and Exalted, All-knowing and Infinite Lord God.
O Lover of Your devoted servants, Your Feet are a Sanctuary of Peace.
O Master of the masterless, Helper of the helpless, Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary. ||5||
Seeing the deer, the hunter aims his weapons.
But if one is protected by the Lord of the World, O Nanak, not a hair on his head will be touched. ||6||
He may be surrounded on all four sides by servants and powerful warriors;
he may dwell in a lofty place, difficult to approach, and never even think of death.
But when the Order comes from the Primal Lord God, O Nanak, even an ant can take away his breath of life. ||7||
To be imbued and attuned to the Word of the Shabad; to be kind and compassionate; to sing the Kirtan of the Lord's Praises - these are the most worthwhile actions in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga.
In this way, one's inner doubts and emotional attachments are dispelled.
God is pervading and permeating all places.
So obtain the Blessed Vision of His Darshan; He dwells upon the tongues of the Holy.
O Nanak, meditate and chant the Name of the Beloved Lord, Har, Har, Har, Haray. ||8||
Beauty fades away, islands fade away, the sun, moon, stars and sky fade away.
The earth, mountains, forests and lands fade away.
One's spouse, children, siblings and loved friends fade away.
Gold and jewels and the incomparable beauty of Maya fade away.
Only the Eternal, Unchanging Lord does not fade away.
O Nanak, only the humble Saints are steady and stable forever. ||9||
Do not delay in practicing righteousness; delay in committing sins.
Implant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within yourself, and abandon greed.
In the Sanctuary of the Saints, the sins are erased. The character of righteousness is received by that person,
O Nanak, with whom the Lord is pleased and satisfied. ||10||
The person of shallow understanding is dying in emotional attachment; he is engrossed in pursuits of pleasure with his wife.
With youthful beauty and golden earrings,
wondrous mansions, decorations and clothes - this is how Maya clings to him.
O Eternal, Unchanging, Benevolent Lord God, O Sanctuary of the Saints, Nanak humbly bows to You. ||11||
If there is birth, then there is death. If there is pleasure, then there is pain. If there is enjoyment, then there is disease.
If there is high, then there is low. If there is small, then there is great.
