Fifth Mehl, Raag Gauree Gwaarayree, Chau-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
How can happiness be found, O my Siblings of Destiny?
How can the Lord, our Help and Support, be found? ||1||Pause||
There is no happiness in owning one's own home, in all of Maya,
or in lofty mansions casting beautiful shadows.
In fraud and greed, this human life is being wasted. ||1||
