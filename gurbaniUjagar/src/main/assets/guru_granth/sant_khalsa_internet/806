Meditating, meditating in remembrance on the Creator Lord, the Architect of Destiny, I am fulfilled. ||3||
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, Nanak enjoys the Lord's Love.
He has returned home, with the Perfect Guru. ||4||12||17||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
All treasures come from the Perfect Divine Guru. ||1||Pause||
Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, the man lives.
The faithless cynic dies in shame and misery. ||1||
The Name of the Lord has become my Protector.
The wretched, faithless cynic makes only useless efforts. ||2||
Spreading slander, many have been ruined.
Their necks, heads and feet are tied by death's noose. ||3||
Says Nanak, the humble devotees chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
The Messenger of Death does not even approach them. ||4||13||18||
Raag Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl, Fourth House, Du-Padas:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
What blessed destiny will lead me to meet my God?
Each and every moment and instant, I continually meditate on the Lord. ||1||
I meditate continually on the Lotus Feet of God.
What wisdom will lead me to attain my Beloved? ||1||Pause||
Please, bless me with such Mercy, O my God,
that Nanak may never, ever forget You. ||2||1||19||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Within my heart, I meditate on the Lotus Feet of God.
Disease is gone, and I have found total peace. ||1||
The Guru relieved my sufferings, and blessed me with the gift.
My birth has been rendered fruitful, and my life is approved. ||1||Pause||
The Ambrosial Bani of God's Word is the Unspoken Speech.
Says Nanak, the spiritually wise live by meditating on God. ||2||2||20||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
The Guru, the Perfect True Guru, has blessed me with peace and tranquility.
Peace and joy have welled up, and the mystical trumpets of the unstruck sound current vibrate. ||1||Pause||
Sufferings, sins and afflictions have been dispelled.
Remembering the Lord in meditation, all sinful mistakes have been erased. ||1||
Joining together, O beautiful soul-brides, celebrate and make merry.
Guru Nanak has saved my honor. ||2||3||21||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
Intoxicated with the wine of attachment, love of worldly possessions and deceit, and bound in bondage, he is wild and hideous.
Day by day, his life is winding down; practicing sin and corruption, he is trapped by the noose of Death. ||1||
I seek Your Sanctuary, O God, Merciful to the meek.
I have crossed over the terrible, treacherous, enormous world-ocean, with the dust of the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||1||Pause||
O God, Giver of peace, All-powerful Lord and Master, my soul, body and all wealth are Yours.
Please, break my bonds of doubt, O Transcendent Lord, forever Merciful God of Nanak. ||2||4||22||
Bilaaval, Fifth Mehl:
The Transcendent Lord has brought bliss to all; He has confirmed His Natural Way.
He has become Merciful to the humble, holy Saints, and all my relatives blossom forth in joy. ||1||
The True Guru Himself has resolved my affairs.
