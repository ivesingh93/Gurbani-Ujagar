O my tongue, you are engrossed in other tastes, but your thirsty desire is not quenched.
Your thirst shall not be quenched by any means, until you attain the subtle essence of the Lord.
If you do obtain the subtle essence of the Lord, and drink in this essence of the Lord, you shall not be troubled by desire again.
This subtle essence of the Lord is obtained by good karma, when one comes to meet with the True Guru.
Says Nanak, all other tastes and essences are forgotten, when the Lord comes to dwell within the mind. ||32||
