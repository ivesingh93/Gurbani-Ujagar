He nourished us in the mother's womb; why forget Him from the mind?
Why forget from the mind such a Great Giver, who gave us sustenance in the fire of the womb?
Nothing can harm one, whom the Lord inspires to embrace His Love.
He Himself is the love, and He Himself is the embrace; the Gurmukh contemplates Him forever.
Says Nanak, why forget such a Great Giver from the mind? ||28||
