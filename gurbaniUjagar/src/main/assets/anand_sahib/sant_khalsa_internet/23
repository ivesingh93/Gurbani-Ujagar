Come, O beloved Sikhs of the True Guru, and sing the True Word of His Bani.
Sing the Guru's Bani, the supreme Word of Words.
Those who are blessed by the Lord's Glance of Grace - their hearts are imbued with this Bani.
Drink in this Ambrosial Nectar, and remain in the Lord's Love forever; meditate on the Lord, the Sustainer of the world.
Says Nanak, sing this True Bani forever. ||23||
