The Simritees and the Shaastras discriminate between good and evil, but they do not know the true essence of reality.
They do not know the true essence of reality without the Guru; they do not know the true essence of reality.
The world is asleep in the three modes and doubt; it passes the night of its life sleeping.
Those humble beings remain awake and aware, within whose minds, by Guru's Grace, the Lord abides; they chant the Ambrosial Word of the Guru's Bani.
Says Nanak, they alone obtain the essence of reality, who night and day remain lovingly absorbed in the Lord; they pass the night of their life awake and aware. ||27||
