Raamkalee, Third Mehl, Anand ~ The Song Of Bliss:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
I am in ecstasy, O my mother, for I have found my True Guru.
I have found the True Guru, with intuitive ease, and my mind vibrates with the music of bliss.
The jeweled melodies and their related celestial harmonies have come to sing the Word of the Shabad.
The Lord dwells within the minds of those who sing the Shabad.
Says Nanak, I am in ecstasy, for I have found my True Guru. ||1||
