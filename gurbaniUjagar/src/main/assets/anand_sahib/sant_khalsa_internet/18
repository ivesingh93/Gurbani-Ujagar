By religious rituals, intuitive poise is not found; without intuitive poise, skepticism does not depart.
Skepticism does not depart by contrived actions; everybody is tired of performing these rituals.
The soul is polluted by skepticism; how can it be cleansed?
Wash your mind by attaching it to the Shabad, and keep your consciousness focused on the Lord.
Says Nanak, by Guru's Grace, intuitive poise is produced, and this skepticism is dispelled. ||18||
