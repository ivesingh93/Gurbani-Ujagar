Sing this true song of praise in the true home of your soul.
Sing the song of praise in your true home; meditate there on the True Lord forever.
They alone meditate on You, O True Lord, who are pleasing to Your Will; as Gurmukh, they understand.
This Truth is the Lord and Master of all; whoever is blessed, obtains it.
Says Nanak, sing the true song of praise in the true home of your soul. ||39||
