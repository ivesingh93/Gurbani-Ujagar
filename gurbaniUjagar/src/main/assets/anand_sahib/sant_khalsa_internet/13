The angelic beings and the silent sages search for the Ambrosial Nectar; this Amrit is obtained from the Guru.
This Amrit is obtained, when the Guru grants His Grace; He enshrines the True Lord within the mind.
All living beings and creatures were created by You; only some come to see the Guru, and seek His blessing.
Their greed, avarice and egotism are dispelled, and the True Guru seems sweet.
Says Nanak, those with whom the Lord is pleased, obtain the Amrit, through the Guru. ||13||
