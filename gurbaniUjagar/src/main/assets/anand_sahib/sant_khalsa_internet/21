If a Sikh turns to the Guru with sincere faith, as sunmukh -
if a Sikh turns to the Guru with sincere faith, as sunmukh, his soul abides with the Guru.
Within his heart, he meditates on the lotus feet of the Guru; deep within his soul, he contemplates Him.
Renouncing selfishness and conceit, he remains always on the side of the Guru; he does not know anyone except the Guru.
Says Nanak, listen, O Saints: such a Sikh turns toward the Guru with sincere faith, and becomes sunmukh. ||21||
