The Word of the Guru's Shabad is a jewel, studded with diamonds.
The mind which is attached to this jewel, merges into the Shabad.
One whose mind is attuned to the Shabad, enshrines love for the True Lord.
He Himself is the diamond, and He Himself is the jewel; one who is blessed, understands its value.
Says Nanak, the Shabad is a jewel, studded with diamonds. ||25||
