Without the true love of devotion, the body is without honor.
The body is dishonored without devotional love; what can the poor wretches do?
No one except You is all-powerful; please bestow Your Mercy, O Lord of all nature.
There is no place of rest, other than the Name; attached to the Shabad, we are embellished with beauty.
Says Nanak, without devotional love, what can the poor wretches do? ||6||
