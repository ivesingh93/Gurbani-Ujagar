The Lord is my capital; my mind is the merchant.
The Lord is my capital, and my mind is the merchant; through the True Guru, I know my capital.
Meditate continually on the Lord, Har, Har, O my soul, and you shall collect your profits daily.
This wealth is obtained by those who are pleasing to the Lord's Will.
Says Nanak, the Lord is my capital, and my mind is the merchant. ||31||
