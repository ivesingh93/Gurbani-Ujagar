Bliss, bliss - everyone talks of bliss; bliss is known only through the Guru.
Eternal bliss in known only through the Guru, when the Beloved Lord grants His Grace.
Granting His Grace, He cuts away our sins; He blesses us with the healing ointment of spiritual wisdom.
Those who eradicate attachment from within themselves, are adorned with the Shabad, the Word of the True Lord.
Says Nanak, this alone is bliss - bliss which is known through the Guru. ||7||
