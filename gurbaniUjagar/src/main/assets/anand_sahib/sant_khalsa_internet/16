This song of praise is the Shabad, the most beautiful Word of God.
This beauteous Shabad is the everlasting song of praise, spoken by the True Guru.
This is enshrined in the minds of those who are so pre-destined by the Lord.
Some wander around, babbling on and on, but none obtain Him by babbling.
Says Nanak, the Shabad, this song of praise, has been spoken by the True Guru. ||16||
