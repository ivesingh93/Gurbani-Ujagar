As You make me walk, so do I walk, O my Lord and Master; what else do I know of Your Glorious Virtues?
As You cause them to walk, they walk - You have placed them on the Path.
In Your Mercy, You attach them to the Naam; they meditate forever on the Lord, Har, Har.
Those whom You cause to listen to Your sermon, find peace in the Gurdwara, the Guru's Gate.
Says Nanak, O my True Lord and Master, you make us walk according to Your Will. ||15||
