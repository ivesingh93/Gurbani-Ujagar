O my True Lord and Master, what is there which is not in Your celestial home?
Everything is in Your home; they receive, unto whom You give.
Constantly singing Your Praises and Glories, Your Name is enshrined in the mind.
The divine melody of the Shabad vibrates for those, within whose minds the Naam abides.
Says Nanak, O my True Lord and Master, what is there which is not in Your home? ||3||
