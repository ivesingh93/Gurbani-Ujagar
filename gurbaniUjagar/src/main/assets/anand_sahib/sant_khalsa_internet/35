O my body, why have you come into this world? What actions have you committed?
And what actions have you committed, O my body, since you came into this world?
The Lord who formed your form - you have not enshrined that Lord in your mind.
By Guru's Grace, the Lord abides within the mind, and one's pre-ordained destiny is fulfilled.
Says Nanak, this body is adorned and honored, when one's consciousness is focused on the True Guru. ||35||
