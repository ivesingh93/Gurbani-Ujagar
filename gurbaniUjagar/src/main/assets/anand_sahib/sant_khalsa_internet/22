One who turns away from the Guru, and becomes baymukh - without the True Guru, he shall not find liberation.
He shall not find liberation anywhere else either; go and ask the wise ones about this.
He shall wander through countless incarnations; without the True Guru, he shall not find liberation.
But liberation is attained, when one is attached to the feet of the True Guru, chanting the Word of the Shabad.
Says Nanak, contemplate this and see, that without the True Guru, there is no liberation. ||22||
