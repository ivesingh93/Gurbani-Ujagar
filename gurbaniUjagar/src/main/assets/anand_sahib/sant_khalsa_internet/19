Inwardly polluted, and outwardly pure.
Those who are outwardly pure and yet polluted within, lose their lives in the gamble.
They contract this terrible disease of desire, and in their minds, they forget about dying.
In the Vedas, the ultimate objective is the Naam, the Name of the Lord; but they do not hear this, and they wander around like demons.
Says Nanak, those who forsake Truth and cling to falsehood, lose their lives in the gamble. ||19||
