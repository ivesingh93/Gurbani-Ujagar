Inwardly pure, and outwardly pure.
Those who are outwardly pure and also pure within, through the Guru, perform good deeds.
Not even an iota of falsehood touches them; their hopes are absorbed in the Truth.
Those who earn the jewel of this human life, are the most excellent of merchants.
Says Nanak, those whose minds are pure, abide with the Guru forever. ||20||
