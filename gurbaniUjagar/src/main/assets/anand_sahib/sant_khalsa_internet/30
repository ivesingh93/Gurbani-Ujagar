The Lord Himself is priceless; His worth cannot be estimated.
His worth cannot be estimated, even though people have grown weary of trying.
If you meet such a True Guru, offer your head to Him; your selfishness and conceit will be eradicated from within.
Your soul belongs to Him; remain united with Him, and the Lord will come to dwell in your mind.
The Lord Himself is priceless; very fortunate are those, O Nanak, who attain to the Lord. ||30||
