My mind has become joyful, hearing of God's coming.
Sing the songs of joy to welcome the Lord, O my companions; my household has become the Lord's Mansion.
Sing continually the songs of joy to welcome the Lord, O my companions, and sorrow and suffering will not afflict you.
Blessed is that day, when I am attached to the Guru's feet and meditate on my Husband Lord.
I have come to know the unstruck sound current and the Word of the Guru's Shabad; I enjoy the sublime essence of the Lord, the Lord's Name.
Says Nanak, God Himself has met me; He is the Doer, the Cause of causes. ||34||
