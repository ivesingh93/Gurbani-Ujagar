The Panch Shabad, the five primal sounds, vibrate in that blessed house.
In that blessed house, the Shabad vibrates; He infuses His almighty power into it.
Through You, we subdue the five demons of desire, and slay Death, the torturer.
Those who have such pre-ordained destiny are attached to the Lord's Name.
Says Nanak, they are at peace, and the unstruck sound current vibrates within their homes. ||5||
