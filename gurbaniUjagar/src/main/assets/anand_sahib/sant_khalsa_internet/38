The Lord placed the soul to the cave of the body, and blew the breath of life into the musical instrument of the body.
He blew the breath of life into the musical instrument of the body, and revealed the nine doors; but He kept the Tenth Door hidden.
Through the Gurdwara, the Guru's Gate, some are blessed with loving faith, and the Tenth Door is revealed to them.
There are many images of the Lord, and the nine treasures of the Naam; His limits cannot be found.
Says Nanak, the Lord placed the soul to the cave of the body, and blew the breath of life into the musical instrument of the body. ||38||
