O my ears, you were created only to hear the Truth.
To hear the Truth, you were created and attached to the body; listen to the True Bani.
Hearing it, the mind and body are rejuvenated, and the tongue is absorbed in Ambrosial Nectar.
The True Lord is unseen and wondrous; His state cannot be described.
Says Nanak, listen to the Ambrosial Naam and become holy; you were created only to hear the Truth. ||37||
