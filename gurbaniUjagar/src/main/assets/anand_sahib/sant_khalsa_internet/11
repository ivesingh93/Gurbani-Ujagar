O beloved mind, contemplate the True Lord forever.
This family which you see shall not go along with you.
They shall not go along with you, so why do you focus your attention on them?
Don't do anything that you will regret in the end.
Listen to the Teachings of the True Guru - these shall go along with you.
Says Nanak, O beloved mind, contemplate the True Lord forever. ||11||
