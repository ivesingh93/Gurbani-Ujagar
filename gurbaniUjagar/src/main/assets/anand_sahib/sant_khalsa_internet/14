The lifestyle of the devotees is unique and distinct.
The devotees' lifestyle is unique and distinct; they follow the most difficult path.
They renounce greed, avarice, egotism and desire; they do not talk too much.
The path they take is sharper than a two-edged sword, and finer than a hair.
By Guru's Grace, they shed their selfishness and conceit; their hopes are merged in the Lord.
Says Nanak, the lifestyle of the devotees, in each and every age, is unique and distinct. ||14||
