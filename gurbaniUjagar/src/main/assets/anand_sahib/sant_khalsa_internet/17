Those humble beings who meditate on the Lord become pure.
Meditating on the Lord, they become pure; as Gurmukh, they meditate on Him.
They are pure, along with their mothers, fathers, family and friends; all their companions are pure as well.
Pure are those who speak, and pure are those who listen; those who enshrine it within their minds are pure.
Says Nanak, pure and holy are those who, as Gurmukh, meditate on the Lord, Har, Har. ||17||
