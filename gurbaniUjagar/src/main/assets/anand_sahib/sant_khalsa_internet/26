He Himself created Shiva and Shakti, mind and matter; the Creator subjects them to His Command.
Enforcing His Order, He Himself sees all. How rare are those who, as Gurmukh, come to know Him.
They break their bonds, and attain liberation; they enshrine the Shabad within their minds.
Those whom the Lord Himself makes Gurmukh, lovingly focus their consciousness on the One Lord.
Says Nanak, He Himself is the Creator; He Himself reveals the Hukam of His Command. ||26||
