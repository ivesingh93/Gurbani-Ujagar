O my body, the Lord infused His Light into you, and then you came into the world.
The Lord infused His Light into you, and then you came into the world.
The Lord Himself is your mother, and He Himself is your father; He created the created beings, and revealed the world to them.
By Guru's Grace, some understand, and then it's a show; it seems like just a show.
Says Nanak, He laid the foundation of the Universe, and infused His Light, and then you came into the world. ||33||
