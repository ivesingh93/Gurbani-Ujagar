Raamkalee, Third Mehl, Anand ~ The Song Of Bliss:
One Universal Creator God. By The Grace Of The True Guru:
I am in ecstasy, O my mother, for I have found my True Guru.
I have found the True Guru, with intuitive ease, and my mind vibrates with the music of bliss.
The jeweled melodies and their related celestial harmonies have come to sing the Word of the Shabad.
The Lord dwells within the minds of those who sing the Shabad.
Says Nanak, I am in ecstasy, for I have found my True Guru. ||1||
O my mind, remain always with the Lord.
Remain always with the Lord, O my mind, and all sufferings will be forgotten.
He will accept You as His own, and all your affairs will be perfectly arranged.
Our Lord and Master is all-powerful to do all things, so why forget Him from your mind?
Says Nanak, O my mind, remain always with the Lord. ||2||
O my True Lord and Master, what is there which is not in Your celestial home?
Everything is in Your home; they receive, unto whom You give.
Constantly singing Your Praises and Glories, Your Name is enshrined in the mind.
The divine melody of the Shabad vibrates for those, within whose minds the Naam abides.
Says Nanak, O my True Lord and Master, what is there which is not in Your home? ||3||
The True Name is my only support.
The True Name is my only support; it satisfies all hunger.
It has brought peace and tranquility to my mind; it has fulfilled all my desires.
I am forever a sacrifice to the Guru, who possesses such glorious greatness.
Says Nanak, listen, O Saints; enshrine love for the Shabad.
The True Name is my only support. ||4||
The Panch Shabad, the five primal sounds, vibrate in that blessed house.
In that blessed house, the Shabad vibrates; He infuses His almighty power into it.
Through You, we subdue the five demons of desire, and slay Death, the torturer.
Those who have such pre-ordained destiny are attached to the Lord's Name.
Says Nanak, they are at peace, and the unstruck sound current vibrates within their homes. ||5||
Listen to the song of bliss, O most fortunate ones; all your longings shall be fulfilled.
I have obtained the Supreme Lord God, and all sorrows have been forgotten.
Pain, illness and suffering have departed, listening to the True Bani.
The Saints and their friends are in ecstasy, knowing the Perfect Guru.
Pure are the listeners, and pure are the speakers; the True Guru is all-pervading and permeating.
Prays Nanak, touching the Guru's Feet, the unstruck sound current of the celestial bugles vibrates and resounds. ||40||1||
