THINGS TO ADD:

1. Bookmark Folders.
2. Gurbani Dictionary By Word Taken From SriGranth.org
3. Add Shabads only.
4. Sharedpreference doesn't work when shabad activity is opened and shabad is shown, going back kills the shabad list.


THINGS TO BE FIXED:
1. DONE - Ang/Pauri/Ashtpadi Text Gets Deleted
2. DONE - One Page bani name (Chaupai Sahib, Jaap Sahib, 6 paudi Anand Sahib, etc) gets deleted, number edittext and search box appears which shouldnâ€™t. Should also disable Prev and Next buttons.
3. DONE - Shabad search list returns null and throws exception.
4. DONE - Ang does not exist when search button is clicked. ConstantsMethods.ang returns 0.
5. When the page is reopened after the activity is destroyed, it doesn't save the translation/teeka that is selected before the activity is destroyed.


Changing App Design:
1. User can view Guru Granth Sahib in Different Translations, can view nitnem and other banis.
2.
